raw materials 

raw materials for our manufacturing operations primarily consisting of steel are generally available in adequate quantities however the global health pandemic and disruptions in the commercial transportation network have stressed the availability of certain raw materials there has been volatility in steel costs over the last several years particularity in 2021 as the steel price index increased over 100 percent compared to the prior year a portion of our customers have contractual pricing tied to a steel index 

research and development 

to improve our competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin our global engineering center in nanjing china and our operating locations our total expenditures for research and development in 2021 2020 and 2019 were 942 million 807 million and 879 million respectively 

patents and trademarks 

we own and use in our businesses various trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and licenses although we believe our trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and licenses to constitute a valuable asset in the aggregate we do not regard our business as being materially dependent on any single or group of related trademarks trade names patents trade secrets or licenses our trade name is important with respect to our products particularly in china india and the us 

human capital 

we employed approximately 13700 employees as of december 31 2021 primarily nonunion the foundation of how we conduct business and interact with our employees is outlined in the a o smith corporation guiding principles which were refreshed in 2021 and our statement of values these principles and values help to shape how we hire train and treat our employees emphasizing teamwork and promoting diversity in seeking our objectives we believe that the critical elements of our effort to attract retain and develop talent are employee engagement talent development a focus on employee safety and market competitive compensation 

we conduct a global employee engagement survey on a biannual basis this thirdpartymanaged survey measures employees level of engagement against external norms and provides us with actionable feedback that drives improvement priorities survey participation in 2020 was 96 percent which we believe indicates our employees willingness to share their perspectives and a commitment to continuous improvement we will conduct the survey again in 2022 

we provide all employees with a wide range of professional development experiences both formal and informal to help them achieve their full potential some of the formal development programs that employees have access to include earlycareer leadership development programs frontline leadership development programs continuous improvement skillbuilding programs core process technology councils and tuition reimbursement for degree programs or trade schools globally all office and professional employees have a formal performance review and development plans with a focus on learning by doing

backlog 

due to the shortcycle nature of our businesses none of our operations sustain significant backlogs 

government regulations and environmental matters

 item 1a – risk factors 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows the risks set forth below are not an exhaustive list of potential risks but reflect those that we believe to be material you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks were to actually occur then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

economic and industry risks 

■ our operations could be adversely impacted by material and component price volatility and availability as well as supplier concentration 

the market prices for certain materials and components we purchase primarily steel have been volatile us steel index prices alone increased over 100 percent in 2021 we have also experienced inflation related increases in our transportation costs in addition some components are subject to long lead times disruptions to the commercial transportation network including limited container and trucking capacity and port congestion have increased supplier delivery times for materials and components to our facilities and in some cases our ability to timely ship to customers we engage in ongoing communications with our suppliers to identify and mitigate risk of potential disruptions and to manage our material and component inventory levels significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials and components we purchase or delays in their delivery could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers as a response to cost inflation in materials and components we announced price increases on water heaters in north america in 2021 that compound to approximately 50 percent historically there has been a lag in our ability to recover increased material costs from customers and that lag particularly for the price increases that we implemented in 2021 could negatively impact our profitability in some cases we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components we require in the manufacturing of our products a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ the global coronavirus covid19 pandemic or other global public health pandemics could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if a global public health pandemic including the current covid19 pandemic interferes with the ability of our employees suppliers and customers to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business and operations the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world and it could have a material negative impact on our business and operations in numerous ways including but not limited to those outlined below 

• the risk that we or our employees suppliers or customers may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time including shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities 

• restrictions on shipping products from certain jurisdictions where they are produced or into certain jurisdictions where customers are located 

• inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to increased logistics costs longer shipment times and disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components transportation workforce or other manufacturing and distribution capability 

• failure of third parties on which we rely including our suppliers distributors contractors and commercial banks to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties workforce disruptions or mandated shutdowns by governmental authorities may adversely impact our operations 

• significant reductions in demand particularly for our commercial products or significant volatility in demand and a global economic recession that could reduce demand for our products resulting from actions taken by governments businesses andor the general public in an effort to limit exposure to and spreading of such infectious diseases such as travel restrictions quarantines and business shutdowns or slowdowns in addition there is risk that the 

commercial sector such as the restaurant and hospitality industries in which we have customers will experience longterm shifts in consumer behavior which could negatively impact demand or capacity and may not return to prepandemic levels 

• manufacturing plant inefficiencies due to safety and preventative health measures that we have implemented in our plants to prevent the spread of covid19 

• deterioration of worldwide capital credit and financial markets that could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic or other outbreaks of disease or similar public health threats materially and adversely impacts our business results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain and will depend on future developments such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus periodic surges of the virus the severity of the virus and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak in addition we cannot predict how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the covid19 pandemic on our suppliers thirdparty service providers andor customers 

■ the effects of a global and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a decline in economic activity such as recession or economic downturn in the us and other regions in the world in which we do business could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition or slower adoption of energyefficient water heaters and boilers or highquality water treatment products which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows such deterioration in economic conditions could arise from many factors or fears including public health crises or political instability in addition an increase in price levels generally or in particular industries such as the recent inflation in steel prices and logistics costs could result in a consumer shift away from the products we offer which could adversely affect our revenues and at the same time increase our costs a deterioration in economic conditions also could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials or increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ because approximately 26 percent of our net sales in 2021 were attributable to china adverse economic conditions or changes in consumer behavior in china could impact our business 

our sales in china increased 24 percent in local currency in 2021 compared to 2020 our sales in china were significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic in 2020 we derive a substantial portion of our sales in china from premiumtier products changes in consumer preferences and purchasing behaviors including preferences for ecommerce weakening consumer confidence and sentiment as well as economic uncertainty sociopolitical risks increased competition from chinese based companies and the potential future impact of the covid19 pandemic may prompt chinese consumers to postpone purchases choose lowerpriced products or different alternatives or lengthen the cycle of replacement purchases further deterioration in the chinese economy may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ because we participate in markets that are highly competitive our revenues and earnings could decline as we respond to competition 

we sell all of our products in highly competitive and evolving markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing research and development and distribution resources than we have others may invest little in technology or product development but compete on price and the rapid replication of features benefits and technologies and some are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing or geographic footprints in north america the gas tankless portion of the water heating market has for many years increased as a percentage of the overall market while we have many gas tankless products our market share for gas tankless products is lower than our market share for the remainder of the water heating market further expansion of the gas tankless portion of the north america market which we believe was approximately 12 percent of the residential market segment in 2021 could have an impact on our operating results we cannot assure that our products will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors there could be new market participants that change the dynamics of those markets and it is possible that we will not be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ our business could be adversely impacted by changes in consumer purchasing behavior consumer preferences and technological changes 

consumer preferences for products and the methods in which they purchase products are constantly changing based on among other factors cost convenience environmental and social concerns and perceptions consumer purchasing behavior may shift the product mix in the markets we participate in or result in a shift to other distribution channels including ecommerce which continues to expand for example consumer preferences may shift toward more efficient gas products or electric powered products due to the increased attention on the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment in response to utility incentive programs or the emergence of state or federal incentives in addition technologies are ever changing our ability to timely develop and successfully market new products and to develop acquire retain and protect necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success but cannot reasonably be assured it is possible that we will not be able to develop new technologies products or distribution channels to align with consumer purchasing behavior and consumer preferences which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including natural disasters political disruptions terrorist attacks public health issues and acts of war could significantly disrupt production or impact consumer spending 

as a global company with a large international footprint we are subject to increased risk of damage or disruption to us and our employees facilities suppliers distributors or customers extraordinary events including natural disasters resulting from but not limited to climate change political disruptions terrorist attacks public health issues such as the current covid19 pandemic and acts of war may disrupt our business and operations and impact our supply chain and access to necessary raw materials or could adversely affect the economy generally resulting in a loss of sales and customers two of our manufacturing plants are located within a floodplain that has experienced past flooding events we also have other manufacturing facilities located in hurricane and earthquake zones any of these disruptions or other extraordinary events outside of our control that impact our operations or the operations of our suppliers and key distributors could affect our business negatively harming operating results in addition these types of events also could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or depending on the severity globally which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

business operational and strategic risks 

■ we sell our products and operate outside the us and to a lesser extent rely on imports and exports which may present additional risks to our business 

approximately 36 percent of our net sales in 2021 were attributable to products sold outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent in europe and india we also have operations and business relationships outside the us that comprise a portion of our manufacturing supply and distribution approximately 6800 of our 13700 employees as of december 31 2021 were located in china at december 31 2021 approximately 608 million of cash and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of which were located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions or changes to trade agreements the impact of foreign government regulations actions or policies the effects of income taxes governmental expropriation the imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries labor relations problems the imposition of environmental or employment laws or other restrictions or actions by foreign governments and differences in business practices unfavorable changes in the political regulatory or trade climate diplomatic relations or government policies particularly in relation to countries where we have a presence including canada china india and mexico could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the us 

■ a material loss cancellation reduction or delay in purchases by one or more of our largest customers could harm our business 

net sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 41 percent of our sales in 2021 we expect that our customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of customers makes our relationships with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may shift their purchases to our competitors in the future our customers may experience financial instability affecting their ability to pay or make future purchases further a customer may be acquired by a customer of a competitor which could result in our loss of that customer the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers or our inability to successfully develop 

relationships with additional customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

■ a portion of our business could be adversely affected by a decline in north american new residential construction a decline in commercial construction or a decline in replacementrelated volume of water heaters and boilers 

residential new construction activity in north america and industrywide replacementrelated volume of water heaters have shown growth which could decline in the future commercial construction activity in north america grew in 2021 after declining in 2020 we believe that the significant majority of the markets we serve are for replacement of existing products and residential water heater replacement volume was strong in 2021 changes in the replacement volume and in the construction market in north america could negatively affect us 

■ an inability to adequately maintain our information systems and their security as well as to protect data and other confidential information could adversely affect our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business we utilize information systems for daytoday operations to collect and store sensitive data and information including our proprietary and regulated business information and personally identifiable information of our customers suppliers and business partners as well as personally identifiable information about our employees our information systems are susceptible to outages due to system failures cybersecurity threats failures on the part of thirdparty information system providers natural disasters power loss telecommunications failures viruses fraud theft malicious actors or breaches of security like many companies we and some third parties upon which we rely have experienced cybersecurity attacks on information technology networks and systems products and services in the past but to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we may experience them in the future potentially with increasing frequency from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats that could result in operations failure or breach of security that could lead to disruptions of our business activities the loss or disclosure of both our and our customers’ financial product and other confidential information and could result in regulatory actions litigation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our reputation we have a response plan in place in the event of a data breach and we continue to take steps to maintain and improve data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing and improving internal controls security technologies insurance programs network and data center resiliency and recovery processes 

■ our international operations are subject to risks related to foreign currencies 

we have a significant presence outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent europe mexico and india and therefore hold assets including 492 million of cash and marketable securities denominated in chinese renminbi incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in our consolidated financial statements furthermore typically our products are priced in foreign countries in local currencies as a result we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates hyperinflation in some foreign countries or global exchange rate instability or volatility that strengthens the us dollar against foreign currencies as a result an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our foreign markets has had and could have a negative effect on our profitability in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries’ functional currency the majority of our foreign currency transaction risk results from sales of our products in canada a portion of which we manufacture in the us and to a lesser extent from component purchases in europe and payroll in mexico these risks may hurt our reported sales and profits in the future or negatively impact revenues and earnings translated from foreign currencies into us dollars 

■ our business may be adversely impacted by product defects 

product defects can occur through our own product development design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities we may incur various expenses related to product defects including product warranty costs product liability and recall or retrofit costs while we maintain a reserve for product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve resulting in current period expenses and a need to increase our reserves for warranty charges in addition product defects and recalls may diminish the reputation of our brand further our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ potential acquisitions could use a significant portion of our capital and we may not successfully integrate future acquisitions or operate them profitably or achieve strategic objectives 

we acquired giant a canadabased manufacturer of residential and commercial water heaters on october 19 2021 for 199 million subject to customary adjustments using a combination of cash and debt we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and we could use a significant portion of our available capital to fund future acquisitions we may not be able to successfully integrate giant or any future acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions in new geographies our unfamiliarity with relevant regulations and market conditions may impact our ability to operate them profitably or achieve our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing the impact of future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

legal regulatory and governance risks 

■ changes in regulations or standards could adversely affect our business 

our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements related to among other items energy and water efficiency environmental emissions labeling and safety while we believe our products are currently efficient safe and environmentfriendly federal foreign state and local governments may adopt laws regulations and codes that will require a transition to nonfossil fuel based sources of energy production as well as significantly reducing or eliminating the onsite combustion of fossil fuels in the building sector such as limiting or prohibiting the delivery of natural gas in new construction a significant change to regulatory requirements that promote a transition to alternative energy sources as a replacement for gas or a significant shift in industry standards could substantially increase manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products affect the types of products we are able to offer or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

■ we are subject to us and global laws and regulations covering our domestic and international operations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a nonus government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ our results of operations may be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits and claims 

our products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture sale and use of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will be able to ultimately pay all insured losses in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ we have significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and an impairment of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets could cause a decline in our net worth 

our total assets include significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase prices we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there have been impairments in the value of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at our businesses does not meet expectations we may be required to reflect noncash charges to operating results for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairments the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets may affect our ability to maintain the debttocapital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements 

we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

■ our pension plans may require future pension contributions which could limit our flexibility in managing our company 

the projected benefit obligation liability of our defined benefit pension plans of 842 million exceeded the fair value of the plan assets of 826 million by approximately 16 million at december 31 2021 us employees hired after january 1 2010 have not participated in our defined benefit plan and benefit accruals for the majority of current salaried and hourly employees ended on december 31 2014 in 2021 our board of directors approved the termination of the previously sunset pension plan with a termination date of december 31 2021 we filed a determination letter with the irs regarding the qualification of the plan termination in 2022 we plan to annuitize the plans remaining pension liability we forecast that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2022 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions however we cannot provide any assurance that contributions will not be required in the future among the key assumptions inherent in our actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to making contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing our company

 item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china europe and india both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas heat pump and electric water heaters boilers tanks and water treatment products both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective region of the world 

in january 2020 an outbreak of a novel coronavirus covid19 surfaced in wuhan china which by march 2020 had spread throughout the world and was declared a global pandemic since march 2020 and continuing into 2021 we experienced impacts to our business and other markets worldwide as a result of the covid19 pandemic and in support of continuing our manufacturing efforts we have undertaken numerous and meaningful steps to protect our employees suppliers and customers as we continue to receive guidance from governmental authorities we adjust our safety measures to meet or exceed those guidelines 

our global supply chain management team continued to navigate through supply chain and logistics challenges in 2021 we have seen supply constraints for certain components and raw materials used in our operations as well as limited container and trucking capacity and port congestion and delays while supply chain issues moderated as we moved into 2022 we remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to troubleshoot manage and resolve bottlenecks as the environment remains unpredictable particularly with the surge in the omicron variant of covid19 

we seek to continue to grow our core residential and commercial water heating boiler and water treatment businesses throughout the world this includes focusing on acquisitions that are related to our core business consistent with this strategy we acquired giant factories inc giant a canadabased manufacturer of residential and commercial water heaters on october 19 2021 for 199 million subject to customary adjustments using a combination of debt and cash the acquisition fits squarely in our core capabilities supplements our presence in canada and enhances our capacity and distribution in the region giant contributed 229 million of sales and approximately 001 in earnings per share eps to our results in 2021 and we expect giant will contribute approximately 006008 to our eps in 2022 we will also continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing operations in high growth regions demonstrated by our previous introductions of water treatment products in india and range hoods and cooktops in china 

in our north america segment after approximately eight percent growth each year in 2021 and 2020 we expect residential industry water heater volumes will be down approximately two percent in 2022 compared with 2021 as we believe that industry demand will normalize to more historical growth rates we believe that commercial water heater industry volumes will be flat to slightly down in 2022 compared to 2021 as new construction and replacement installations level off we expect sales in 2022 will benefit from our 2021 price increases which had a cumulative effect on our water heater prices of approximately 50 percent we expect to see a ten percent increase in our sales of boilers in 2022 compared to 2021 due to industry growth of three to four percent our expectation that the transition to higherefficiency boilers will continue as well as our new product introductions we anticipate sales of our north america water treatment products will increase 13 to 14 percent in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by consumer demand for our point of use and point of entry water treatment systems 

in our rest of world segment after strong growth in 2021 we expect 2022 sales in china to increase approximately five percent in local currency compared with 2021 driven by demand for our residential and commercial water treatment products including our replacement filters as well as rangehoods and cooktops we assume china currency rates will stay at levels similar to 2021 

combining all of these factors we expect our consolidated sales to increase between 16 and 18 percent in 2022 our guidance excludes the potential impacts from future acquisitions and assumes the recent surge of the omicron variant subsides during the first quarter of 2022 and does not have a significant impact on our productivity or significantly impact the end markets that we serve 

results of operations 

in this section we discuss the results of our operations for 2021 compared with 2020 we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “liquidity and capital resources” for a discussion related to 2020 compared with 2019 please refer to item 7 of part ii “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 which was filed with the united states securities and exchange commission sec on february 12 2021 and is available on the secs website at wwwsecgov 



our sales in 2021 were 35389 million or 222 percent higher than 2020 sales of 28953 million compared to 2020 which was negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic our sales increase in 2021 was primarily driven by inflationrelated pricing actions and higher water heater boiler and water treatment volumes in north america as well as higher sales in china our acquisition of giant added 229 million of sales in 2021 in addition our sales in china were favorably impacted by approximately 58 million in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the appreciation of the chinese currency compared to the us dollar 

our gross profit margin in 2021 of 370 percent declined compared to 383 percent in 2020 the lower gross margin in 2021 was primarily due to higher steel and other material costs which outpaced our pricing actions 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 7014 million in 2021 or 411 million higher than 2020 the increase in sga expenses in 2021 was primarily due to higher advertising engineering and selling expenses and higher management incentive expenses related to higher earnings compared to 2020 higher sga expenses in 2021 were partially offset by lower spending in china associated with headcount reductions store closures and other costsaving measures implemented during 2020 

to align our business to market conditions in 2020 we recognized 77 million of pretax severance and restructuring expenses the charges were comprised of 68 million severance costs and 09 million of other restructuring expenses these activities are reflected in severance and restructuring expenses in the accompanying financial statements 

interest expense was 43 million in 2021 compared to 73 million in 2020 the decrease in interest expense in 2021 was primarily due to lower average debt levels 

other income was 204 million in 2021 compared to 110 million in 2020 the increase in other income in 2021 was primarily due to higher pension and interest income 

pension income in 2021 was 120 million compared to 51 million in 2020 the service cost component of our pension income is reflected in cost of products sold and sga expenses all other components of our pension income are reflected in other income 

our effective income tax rate was 221 percent in 2021 compared with 223 percent in 2020 our lower effective income tax rate in 2021 was primarily due to a change in geographic earnings mix as well as a favorable tax impact related to amending a previously filed tax return we estimate that our annual effective income tax rate for the full year of 2022 will be between 235 and 24 percent 

north america segment 



sales in our north america segment were 25295 million in 2021 or 4112 million higher than sales of 21183 million in 2020 the increased sales in 2021 were driven primarily by price increases largely on water heaters which were implemented in response to rising material and transportation costs higher sales were also driven by increased volumes across all product lines including 229 million of incremental sales from giant 

north america segment earnings were 5908 million in 2021 an increase of 17 percent compared to segment earnings of 5035 million in 2020 segment margins were 234 percent and 238 percent in 2021 and 2020 respectively higher segment earnings in 2021 were primarily due to inflationrelated price increases and higher volumes partially offset by higher material and logistics costs segment margin was lower in 2021 primarily due to the rise in costs outpacing pricing actions in 2020 segment earnings and margin were adversely impacted by certain costs related to the pandemic those costs included temporarily moving production from mexico to the us paying employees during temporary plant shutdowns proactively deep cleaning facilities paying benefits during employee furloughs and other costs which were approximately 66 million in 2020 we estimate our 2022 north america segment margin will be between 2225 and 2275 percent 

rest of world segment 



sales in our rest of world segment were 10365 million in 2021 or 2362 million higher than sales of 8003 million in 2020 sales in china increased by 32 percent in us dollar terms and 24 percent in local currency in 2021 compared to 2020 in addition our sales in china were favorably impacted by approximately 58 million in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the appreciation of the chinese currency compared to the us dollar the increase in 2021 sales was primarily due to growth in our major product categories in china including electric and gas tankless water heaters and residential and commercial water treatment products including replacement filters sales in china were also positively impacted by lower channel inventory reductions in 2021 compared to 2020 channel inventory levels in china at the end of 2021 were at their lowest level in the last five years products with higher selling prices including superquiet gas tankless water heaters and water treatment products that deliver filtered water at a faster flow rate contributed to sales gains sales in india increased approximately 31 compared to 2020 which was significantly impacted by the pandemic 

rest of world segment earnings were 914 million in 2021 compared to breakeven in 2020 segment margin was 88 percent in 2021 compared to 2020 which was significantly impacted by the pandemic earnings in 2021 increased primarily due to higher volumes in china which was partially offset by higher employee incentives and brandbuildingrelated advertising costs as well as the absence of the social insurance waivers received in 2020 that did not repeat in 2021 higher segment operating margin of 88 was primarily a result of increased operating leverage from higher volumes we expect fullyear segment margin to be approximately 10 percent in 2022 

liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital was 6338 million at december 31 2021 compared with 7317 million at december 31 2020 a majority of the change to working capital was driven by higher accounts payable payroll related accruals and lower cash balances than 2020 which were partially offset by higher inventory and sales related accounts receivable balances we repatriated approximately 168 million of foreign cash and marketable securities in 2021 and utilized it to repurchase shares of our common stock we expect to repatriate approximately 100 million in 2022 and use the proceeds for common stock repurchases 



cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was 6411 million compared with 5621 million during 2020 the improvement in operating cash flows in 2021 was primarily due to increased earnings and lower outlays of working capital including higher accounts payable balances in china due to receipts of cash deposits in advance of sales from certain customers and higher incentive related accruals this was partially offset by higher inventory balances due to increased on hand quantities to ensure product availability and higher accounts receivable balances from higher sales our free cash flow in 2021 and 2020 was 566 million and 505 million respectively we expect free cash flow to be between 500 million to 525 million in 2022 free cash flow is a non us generally accepted accounting principles gaap measure and is described in more detail in the nongaap measures section below we continue to monitor developments on an ongoing basis and have taken proactive measures to focus on cash manage working capital and reduce costs 

our capital expenditures were 751 million in 2021 and 568 million in 2020 included in 2021 capital expenditures was approximately 11 million related to the purchase of our previously leased lloyd r smith corporate technology center in milwaukee wi we project our 2022 capital expenditures will be between 75 and 80 million and expect depreciation and amortization will be approximately 80 million 

during the second quarter of 2021 we renewed and amended our 500 million revolving credit facility which now expires on april 1 2026 the renewed and amended facility with a group of nine banks has an accordion provision that allows it to be increased up to 850 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31 2021 and expect to be in compliance for the foreseeable future 

the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings at december 31 2021 we had 50 million outstanding under the facility and an available borrowing capacity of 450 million we believe the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flows will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

our total debt increased by 835 million from 1132 million at december 31 2020 to 1967 million at december 31 2021 the increase in debt balances was due to our acquisition of giant and repurchases of our common stock our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization calculated excluding operating lease liabilities was 97 percent at december 31 2021 compared with 58 percent at december 31 2020 

our us pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations we were not required to make a contribution to our pension plan in 2021 we forecast that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2022 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions in 2022 for further information on our pension plans see the critical accounting policies below and note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

in 2021 our board of directors approved adding 7000000 shares of common stock to our existing discretionary share repurchase authority under our share repurchase program we may purchase our common stock through a combination of a rule 10b51 automatic trading plan and discretionary purchases in accordance with applicable securities laws the stock repurchase authorization remains effective until terminated by our board of directors which may occur at any time subject to the parameters of any rule 10b51 automatic trading plan that we may then have in effect during 2021 we repurchased 5087467 shares of our stock at a total cost of 3665 million as of december 31 2021 we had 3526357 shares remaining on the share repurchase authority after a blackout period on share repurchase activity in the third quarter related to the giant acquisition we resumed our repurchases in early november on january 25 2022 the board of directors approved adding 3500000 shares of common stock to the existing discretionary share repurchase authority including the additional shares we have approximately 68 million shares available for repurchase as of the date of the board of directors approval we 

intend to repurchase approximately 400 million of our common stock in 2022 through a combination of 10b51 plans and open market purchases 

on october 19 2021 we acquired giant a canadabased manufacturer of residential and commercial water heaters for approximately 199 million subject to customary adjustments using a combination of debt and cash giant manufactures water heaters at two facilities in montreal canada and sells water heating products under the giant brand across canada incremental sales of 23 million were realized in 2021 from the date of acquisition 

we have paid dividends for 82 consecutive years with annual amounts increasing each of the last 30 years we paid dividends of 106 per share in 2021 compared with 098 per share in 2020 we increased our dividend by eight percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the fiveyear compound annual growth rate of our dividend payment is approximately 17 percent 

recent accounting pronouncements 

refer to recent accounting pronouncements in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we monitor these significant factors and adjustments are made as facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an armslength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct a thorough and competent annual quantitative analysis of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets based on the annual goodwill impairment test we determined there was no impairment of our goodwill as of december 31 2021 the fair value of each of our reporting units significantly exceeded its carrying value and a 10 decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would not have resulted in a different conclusion based on the annual indefinitelived assets impairment test we determined there was no impairment of our indefinitelived assets as of december 31 2021 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed at least annually at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates at december 31 2021 and 2020 our reserve for product warranties was 1844 million and 1423 million 

respectively the increase in our reserve for product warranties in 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased steel prices and the acquisition of giant 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year in 2021 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 75 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also utilize an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time at december 31 2021 and 2020 our reserve for product liability was 354 million and 353 million respectively if the estimated loss reserves as of december 31 2021 developed adversely by 10 the impact on earnings would be approximately 29 million 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on plan assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 625 and 675 percent in 2021 and 2020 respectively the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs decreased to 247 percent in 2021 from 318 percent in 2020 for 2022 our expected return on plan assets is 300 percent and our discount rate is 272 percent 

in developing our expected return on plan assets we evaluate our pension plan’s current and target asset allocation the expected longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to bonds managers is between 60 to 95 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to equities private equity managers and cash our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2021 was one percent to equity managers 75 percent to bond managers one percent to private equity managers and the remainder allocated to cash we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical tenyear and 25year compounded annualized returns are 93 percent and 82 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the expected longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 300 percent expected return on plan assets for 2022 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2021 and 2020 were based on the aon aa only above median yield curve which was designed by aon to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the aa only above median yield curve represents a series of annual discount rates from bonds with aa minimum average rating as rated by moody’s investor service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

lowering the expected return on plan assets by 25 basis points would decrease our net pension income for 2021 by approximately 18 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2021 net pension income by approximately 07 million 

pension plan termination 

in 2021 our board of directors approved the termination of our defined benefit pension plan the plan with a termination date of december 31 2021 the plan has filed for a determination letter from the irs regarding the qualification of the plan termination the plan represents over 95 percent of our pension plan liability in 2022 we expect to annuitize the remaining pension liability the plan settlement which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter of 2022 will accelerate the recognition of approximately 445 million or 173 of eps of noncash pretax pension expenses in addition to protect the plan’s funded status the plan transferred a significant portion of its assets to lower risk investments in 2021 the impact of this transition will result in a lower expected rate of return on pension investments and accordingly higher pension expenses in 2022 compared to previous years 

as part of our strategy to derisk our defined benefit pension plan the qualified defined benefit pension plan purchased a group annuity contract whereby an unrelated insurance company assumed 23 million obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees and beneficiaries in 2020 

we recognized pension income of 120 million and 51 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business in 2022 we will provide a nongaap measure adjusted earnings per share that excludes the impact of our estimated pension settlement charge and nonoperating pension income and expenses a reconciliation from gaap measures to nongaap measures is provided in the financial information included in this filing 

nongaap measures 

we provide nongaap measures of adjusted free cash flow and adjusted eps we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures our adjusted eps excludes the impact of pension settlement expenses and nonoperating pension income and expenses 

we believe that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements we believe that the measure of adjusted eps provides useful information to investors about our performance and allows management and our investors to better understand our performance between periods without regard to items we do not consider to be a component of our core operating performance

as we begin 2022 we expect our consolidated sales to increase between 16 to 18 percent compared to 2021 our higher expected sales are driven by pricing actions in north america and increased boiler and water treatment volumes within that region we expect to achieve fullyear earnings of between 156 and 176 per share and an adjusted eps in the range of 335 and 355 per share our 2022 guidance excludes the potential impacts from future acquisitions and assumes the recent surge of the omicron variant subsides during the first quarter of 2022 and does not have a significant impact on our productivity or significantly impact the end markets that we serve 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal foreign state local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2021 and we do not expect them to be material in any single year we have reserves associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves together with available insurance coverage are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

risk management 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant and material risks our erm process assesses manages and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the enterprise risk managementintegrated framework 2017 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on our company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks including decarbonization disruptive technologies and cyber threats among others and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks using a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value however the risks set forth item 1a  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2021 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding with notional values of 1863 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in exchange rates would amount to 186 million however gains and losses from our forward contracts will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged

research and development 

to improve our competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin our global engineering center in nanjing china and our operating locations our total expenditures for research and development in 2020 2019 and 2018 were 807 million 879 million and 940 million respectively 

patents and trademarks 

we own and use in our businesses various trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and licenses we do not believe that our business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such trademark trade name patent trade secret or license however our trade name is important with respect to our products particularly in china india and the us 

human capital 

we employed approximately 13900 employees as of december 31 2020 primarily nonunion we have a set of values for conducting our business and interacting with our employees as outlined in the a o smith corporation guiding principles these principles help to shape how we hire train and treat our employees we believe that the critical elements of the effort to retain and develop talent are employee engagement talent development a focus on employee safety and market competitive compensation 

we conduct a global employee engagement survey on a biannual basis this thirdpartymanaged survey measures employees level of engagement against external norms and provides us with actionable feedback that drives improvement priorities survey participation in 2020 was 96 percent which we believe indicates our employees willingness to share their perspectives and a commitment to continuous improvement

 item 1a – risk factors 

in the ordinary course of our business we face various strategic operating compliance and financial risks these risks could have an impact on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows the risks set forth below are not an exhaustive list of potential risks but reflect those that we believe to be material you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks were to actually occur then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

economic and industry risks 

■ the global coronavirus covid19 pandemic or other global public health pandemics could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if a global public health pandemic including the current covid19 pandemic interferes with the ability of our employees suppliers and customers to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business and operations the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world and it could have a material negative impact on our business and operations in numerous ways including but not limited to those outlined below 

• the risk that we or our employees suppliers or customers may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time including shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities 

• restrictions on shipping products from certain jurisdictions where they are produced or into certain jurisdictions where customers are located 

• inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to increased logistics costs longer shipment times and disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components transportation workforce or other manufacturing and distribution capability 

• failure of third parties on which we rely including our suppliers distributors contractors and commercial banks to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties or mandated shutdowns by governmental authorities may adversely impact our operations 

• significant reductions in demand particularly for our commercial products or significant volatility in demand and a global economic recession that could further reduce demand for our products resulting from actions taken by governments businesses andor the general public in an effort to limit exposure to and spreading of such infectious diseases such as travel restrictions quarantines and business shutdowns or slowdowns in addition there is risk that the commercial sector such as the restaurant and hospitality industries in which we have customers will experience longterm shifts in consumer behavior which could negatively impact demand or capacity and may not return to prepandemic levels 

• manufacturing plant inefficiencies due to safety and preventative health measures that we have implemented in our plants to prevent the spread of covid19 

• deterioration of worldwide capital credit and financial markets that could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic or other outbreaks of disease or similar public health threats materially and adversely impacts our business results of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus the severity of the virus and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak in addition we cannot predict how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the covid19 pandemic on our suppliers thirdparty service providers andor customers 

■ the effects of a global economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business 

global economic growth remains volatile and could stall or reverse course a continuation or deepening of the global economic downturn could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition or slower adoption of energyefficient water heaters and boilers or highquality water treatment products which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows in addition a deterioration in current economic conditions due to many factors or fears including public health crises 

or political instability could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials or increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ because approximately 24 percent of our net sales in 2020 were attributable to china adverse economic conditions or changes in consumer behavior in china could impact our business 

our sales in china decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 we believe the decrease was due to business closures and restrictions associated with the covid19 pandemic weaker endmarket demand a higher sales mix of midprice products versus premium price products and further reductions to previously elevated channel inventory levels we derive a substantial portion of our sales in china from premiumtier products changes in consumer preferences and purchasing behaviors including preferences for ecommerce weakening consumer confidence and sentiment as well as economic uncertainty sociopolitical risks increased competition from chinese based companies and the potential future impact of the covid19 pandemic may prompt chinese consumers to postpone purchases choose lowerpriced products or different alternatives or lengthen the cycle of replacement purchases further deterioration in the chinese economy may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ because we participate in markets that are highly competitive our revenues and earnings could decline as we respond to competition 

we sell all of our products in highly competitive and evolving markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing research and development and distribution resources than we have others may invest little in technology or product development but compete on price and the rapid replication of features benefits and technologies and some are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing or geographic footprints in north america the gas tankless portion of the water heating market has for many years increased as a percentage of the overall market while we have many gas tankless products our market share for gas tankless products is lower than our market share for the remainder of the water heating market further expansion of the gas tankless portion of the north america market which we believe was approximately ten percent of the residential market segment in 2020 could have an impact on our operating results we cannot assure that our products will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors there could be new market participants that change the dynamics of those markets and it is possible that we will not be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ our business could be adversely impacted by changes in consumer purchasing behavior consumer preferences and technological changes 

consumer preferences for products and the methods in which they purchase products are constantly changing based on among other factors cost convenience environmental and social concerns and perceptions consumer purchasing behavior may shift the product mix in the markets we participate in or result in a shift to new distribution channels including ecommerce which continues to expand for example consumer preferences may shift toward more efficient gas products or electric powered products due to the increased attention on the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment in response to utility incentive programs or the emergence of state or federal incentives in addition technologies are ever changing our ability to timely develop and successfully market new products and to develop acquire and retain necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success but cannot reasonably be assured it is possible that we will not be able to develop new technologies products or distribution channels to align with consumer purchasing behavior and consumer preferences which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events including natural disasters political disruptions terrorist attacks public health issues and acts of war could significantly disrupt production or impact consumer spending 

as a global company with a large international footprint we are subject to increased risk of damage or disruption to us and our employees facilities suppliers distributors or customers extraordinary events including natural disasters political disruptions terrorist attacks public health issues such as the current covid19 pandemic and acts of war may disrupt our business and operations and impact our supply chain and access to necessary raw materials or could adversely affect the economy generally resulting in a loss of sales and customers one of our manufacturing plants is located within a floodplain that has experienced past flooding events we also have other manufacturing facilities located in hurricane and earthquake zones any of these disruptions or other extraordinary events outside of our control that impact our operations or the operations of our suppliers and key distributors could affect our business negatively harming operating results in addition 

these types of events also could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or depending on the severity globally which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

business operational and strategic risks 

■ we sell our products and operate outside the us and to a lesser extent rely on imports and exports which may present additional risks to our business 

approximately 33 percent of our net sales in 2020 were attributable to products sold outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent in europe and india we also have operations and business relationships outside the us that comprise a portion of our manufacturing supply and distribution approximately 7500 of our 13900 employees as of december 31 2020 were located in china at december 31 2020 approximately 524 million of cash and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of which were located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions or changes to trade agreements the impact of foreign government regulations actions or policies the effects of income taxes governmental expropriation the imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries labor relations problems the imposition of environmental or employment laws or other restrictions or actions by foreign governments and differences in business practices unfavorable changes in the political regulatory or trade climate diplomatic relations or government policies particularly in relation to countries where we have a presence including canada china india and mexico could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the us 

■ a material loss cancellation reduction or delay in purchases by one or more of our largest customers could harm our business 

net sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 43 percent of our sales in 2020 we expect that our customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of customers makes our relationships with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may shift their purchases to our competitors in the future other customers may experience financial instability further a customer may be acquired by a customer of a competitor which could result in our loss of that customer the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers or our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

■ a portion of our business could be adversely affected by a decline in north american new residential construction further decline in commercial construction or a decline in replacement related volume of water heaters and boilers 

residential new construction activity in north america and industrywide replacementrelated volume of water heaters have shown growth which could decline in the future commercial construction activity in north america declined in 2020 after growing modestly in 2019 we believe that the significant majority of the markets we serve are for replacement of existing products and residential water heater replacement volume was strong in 2020 changes in the replacement volume and in the construction market in north america could negatively affect us 

■ our operations could be adversely impacted by material and component price volatility and availability as well as supplier concentration 

the market prices for certain materials and components we purchase primarily steel have been volatile in addition some components are subject to long lead times we engage in ongoing communications with our suppliers to identify and mitigate risk of potential disruptions and to manage inventory levels significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials and components we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in our ability to recover increased material costs from customers and that lag could negatively impact our profitability limited component availability and long lead times could make it difficult for us to meet customer demand in some cases we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components we require in the manufacturing of our products a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ an inability to adequately maintain our information systems and their security as well as to protect data and other confidential information could adversely affect our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business we utilize information systems for daytoday operations to collect and store sensitive data and information including our proprietary and regulated business information and personally identifiable information of our customers suppliers and business partners as well as personally identifiable information about our employees our information systems like those of other companies are susceptible to outages due to system failures cybersecurity threats failures on the part of thirdparty information system providers natural disasters power loss telecommunications failures viruses fraud theft malicious actors or breaches of security we have a response plan in place in the event of a data breach and we continue to take steps to maintain and improve data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing and improving internal controls security technologies insurance programs network and data center resiliency and recovery processes however any operations failure or breach of security which are occurring with increasing frequency from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to disruptions of our business activities the loss or disclosure of both our and our customers’ financial product and other confidential information and could result in regulatory actions litigation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our reputation 

■ our international operations are subject to risks related to foreign currencies 

we have a significant presence outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent europe mexico and india and therefore hold assets including 385 million of cash and marketable securities denominated in chinese renminbi incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in our consolidated financial statements furthermore typically our products are priced in foreign countries in local currencies as a result we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates hyperinflation in some foreign countries or global exchange rate instability or volatility that strengthens the us dollar against foreign currencies as a result an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our foreign markets has had and could have a negative effect on our profitability in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries’ functional currency the majority of our foreign currency transaction risk results from sales of our products in canada which we manufacture in the us and to a lesser extent from component purchases in europe and payroll in mexico these risks may hurt our reported sales and profits in the future or negatively impact revenues and earnings translated from foreign currencies into us dollars 

■ our business may be adversely impacted by product defects 

product defects can occur through our own product development design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities we may incur various expenses related to product defects including product warranty costs product liability and recall or retrofit costs while we maintain a reserve for product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve resulting in current period expenses and a need to increase our reserves for warranty charges in addition product defects and recalls may diminish the reputation of our brand further our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ potential acquisitions could use a significant portion of our capital and we may not successfully integrate future acquisitions or operate them profitably or achieve strategic objectives 

we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and we could use a significant portion of our available capital to fund future acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions in new geographies our unfamiliarity with local regulations and market customs may impact our ability to operate them profitably or achieve our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing the impact of future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

legal regulatory and governance risks 

■ changes in regulations or standards could adversely affect our business 

our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements related to among other items energy and water efficiency environmental emissions labeling and safety while we believe our products are 

currently efficient safe and environmentfriendly federal foreign state and local governments are adopting laws regulations and codes that will require a transition to nonfossil fuel based sources of energy production as well as significantly reducing or eliminating the onsite combustion of fossil fuels in the building sector such as limiting or prohibiting the delivery of natural gas in new construction a significant change to regulatory requirements that promote a transition to alternative energy sources as a replacement for gas or a significant shift in industry standards could substantially increase manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products affect the types of products we are able to offer or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

■ we are subject to us and global laws and regulations covering our domestic and international operations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a nonus government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ our results of operations may be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits and claims 

our products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture sale and use of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will be able to ultimately pay all insured losses in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

■ we have significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and an impairment of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets could cause a decline in our net worth 

our total assets include significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase prices we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there have been impairments in the value of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at our businesses does not meet expectations we may be required to reflect noncash charges to operating results for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairments the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets may affect our ability to maintain the debttocapital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

■ our pension plans may require future pension contributions which could limit our flexibility in managing our company 

the projected benefit obligation liability of our defined benefit pension plans of 870 million exceeded the fair value of the plan assets of 859 million by approximately 11 million at december 31 2020 us employees hired after january 1 2010 have not participated in our defined benefit plan and benefit accruals for the majority of current salaried and hourly employees ended on december 31 2014 we forecast that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2021 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions however we cannot provide any assurance that contributions will not be required in the future among the key assumptions inherent in our actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to making contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing our company 

■ certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit have the ability to influence all matters requiring stockholder approval 

we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock currently are entitled as a class to elect only onethird of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for 

their benefit smith family have entered into a voting trust agreement with respect to shares of our class a common stock and shares of our common stock they own as of december 31 2020 through the voting trust these members of the smith family own approximately 638 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and common stock taken together as a single class and approximately 966 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock as a separate class due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock onetenth of one vote per share and shares of our class a common stock one vote per share the smith family voting trust is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control this ownership position may increase if other members of the smith family enter into the voting trust agreement and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our class a common stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our common stock the voting trust agreement provides that in the event one of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our class a common stock such shares of our class a common stock are automatically exchanged for shares of our common stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust in addition the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our class a common stock and our common stock proposed to be withdrawn or transferred from the trust as a result the smith family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the smith family decide to transfer their shares

 item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china europe and india both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas and electric water heaters boilers tanks and water treatment products both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective region of the world 

in january 2020 an outbreak of a novel coronavirus covid19 surfaced in wuhan china as a result of the outbreak the chinese government required businesses to close and restricted certain travel within the country in cooperation with the government authorities our operations in china closed for approximately four weeks before resuming production before the end of the first quarter in march 2020 covid19 was declared a global pandemic and we experienced impacts to our business and other markets worldwide to date our global manufacturing operations of essential water heating and water treatment products continue without material disruption to our operations as a result of the covid19 pandemic and in support of continuing our manufacturing efforts we have undertaken numerous and meaningful steps to protect our employees suppliers and customers these important steps which in certain cases reduce efficiency include continuous communication and training to our employees on living and working safely in a covid19 environment plant accommodations and reconfigurations to maintain social distancing masks for all employees implementation of sanitizing stations temperature taking and regular proactive deep cleaning and sanitization of our facilities among others as we receive guidance from governmental authorities we adjust our safety measures to meet or exceed those guidelines the majority of our customers in the us are also deemed essential under cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency cisa guidance and are operating their businesses under varying state and local governmental guidance 

our global supply chain management team continues to monitor and manage our ability to operate effectively during the covid19 pandemic to date we have not seen any material disruptions to our supply chain although we have seen an increase in logistics costs and shipment times as a result of pandemicrelated capacity reductions ongoing communications with our suppliers to identify and mitigate risk of potential disruptions and to manage inventory levels continue our us water heater manufacturing lead times which were extended in the second and third quarters due to selfquarantine absenteeism mandated by our covid19 prevention measures stabilized in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of adding manufacturing shifts hiring temporary workers and shifting some production 

while we believe our balance sheet and capital position are strong proactive management of discretionary spending and cost structure will continue on may 1 2020 the members of our board of directors voluntarily reduced the cash component of their board compensation by 25 percent and our chairman and chief executive officer ceo voluntarily reduced his base salary by 25 percent our ceo’s staff which includes our other named executive officers also volunteered a 15 percent reduction in base salary full compensation of our board of directors our ceo and our ceo’s staff was reinstated on october 1 2020 

we estimate that between 80 to 85 percent of our water heater and boiler units sold in the us relate to replacement business while we expect that our replacement business in both water heating and boilers will provide a buffer in any economic downturn resulting from covid19 in a similar manner to what we have seen historically the impacts of the pandemic on consumer spending are difficult to predict 

in our north america segment we expect industry residential water heater volumes will be down approximately two percent in 2021 compared with 2020 which is driven by our belief that customers may have added inventory in 2020 due to industry extended lead times we believe that some destocking by our customers will occur in early 2021 as our lead times have improved and continue to improve we believe that commercial water heater industry volumes will further decline approximately four percent in 2021 as covid19 pandemicimpacted businesses delay or defer new construction and discretionary replacement installations we expect to see a midsingle digit increase to our boiler sales in 2021 compared to 2020 due to industry growth of three to four percent driven by pandemicrelated pent up demand as well as our new product introductions we expect sales of our north america water treatment products to increase by 13 to 14 percent in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by consumer demand for our point of use and point of entry water treatment systems 

in our rest of world segment we expect china sales in 2021 to increase 14 to 15 percent in local currency compared with 2020 due to increased consumer demand we assume china currency rates will stay at current levels and which would add approximately 47 million and 3 million to sales and earnings in 2021 respectively in addition we project that our mix of products sold in china is shifting to more midprice range products from our historical mix of higher priced products we also continue to focus on aligning our cost structure in china through headcount reductions store closures cuts in advertising 

and other cost saving measures our 2020 headcount reductions and restructuring actions we took were largely completed as of the end of the third quarter of 2020 

combining all of these factors we expect our consolidated sales to increase approximately ten percent in 2021 our guidance excludes the potential impacts from future acquisitions and assumes the conditions of our business environment and that of our suppliers and customers are similar in 2021 to what we are experienced in recent months and does not deteriorate as a result of further restrictions or shutdowns due to the covid19 pandemic 

our stated acquisition strategy includes a number of our waterrelated strategic initiatives we will seek to continue to grow our core residential and commercial water heating boiler and water treatment businesses throughout the world we will also continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing operations in high growth regions demonstrated by our introduction of water treatment products in india and vietnam and range hoods and cooktops in china 

results of operations 

our sales in 2020 were 2895 million a decline of 33 percent compared to our 2019 sales of 2993 million compared to 2019 our sales decline in 2020 was primarily driven by lower sales in china and lower commercial water heater volumes and reduced boiler sales in north america the decreased sales in 2020 compared to the prior year more than offset higher water treatment volumes including incremental sales of 16 million from waterright acquired on april 8 2019 and higher residential water heater volumes in north america in addition our sales in china were favorably impacted by currency translation of approximately 9 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the appreciation of the chinese currency compared to the us dollar our sales in 2019 were 2993 million a decline of 61 percent compared to our 2018 sales of 3188 million the decrease in 2019 sales was primarily due to a 23 percent decline in china sales in us dollar terms which was largely a result of weaker endmarket demand in the region year over year channel inventory shifts and a higher mix of sales of midprice products versus premium price products than in the prior year excluding the unfavorable impact from currency translation china sales declined 19 percent in 2019 the sales reduction in china in 2019 compared to 2018 more than offset the benefits of higher sales in north america which were primarily a result of higher sales of water treatment products including incremental sales from our waterright acquisition and water heater pricing actions related to steel and freight cost increases the increase in north america sales in 2019 compared to 2018 was partially offset by lower residential water heater volumes 

our gross profit margin in 2020 of 383 percent declined compared to our gross profit margin of 395 percent in 2019 primarily due to the lower sales volumes our gross profit margin in 2019 of 395 percent declined compared to our gross profit margin of 410 percent in 2018 primarily due to the lower sales volumes in china and a higher mix of midprice products which have lower margins in that region 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 6603 million in 2020 or 553 million lower than 2019 sga expenses were 7156 million in 2019 or 382 million lower than in 2018 the decrease in sga expenses in both 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to lower selling and advertising expenses in china 

to align our business to current market conditions we recognized 77 million of pretax severance and restructuring expenses in 2020 charges recognized were comprised of 68 million severance costs and 09 million of other restructuring expenses on march 21 2018 we announced a plan to transfer water heater boiler and storage tank production from our renton washington plant to our other us plants the majority of the consolidation of operations occurred in the second quarter of 2018 as a result of the relocation of production we incurred pretax restructuring and impairment expenses of 67 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily related to employee severance building lease exit costs and the impairment of assets these activities are reflected in severance restructuring and impairment expenses in the accompanying financial statements 

we provide nonus generally accepted accounting principles gaap measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment earnings that exclude severance restructuring and impairment expenses reconciliations to measures on a gaap basis are provided later in this section we believe that the measures of adjusted earnings adjusted eps and adjusted segment earnings provide useful information to investors about our performance and allow management and our investors to better understand our performance between periods without regard to items we do not consider to be a component of our core operating performance 

interest expense was 73 million in 2020 compared to 110 million in 2019 and 84 million in 2018 the decrease in interest expense in 2020 was primarily due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates than the prior year the increase in interest expense in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher debt levels utilized to fund the acquisition of waterright and share repurchase activity 

other income was 110 million in 2020 compared to 180 million in 2019 and 212 million in 2018 the decrease in other income in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower interest income the decrease in other income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to lower nonservice costrelated pension income and lower interest income 

pension income in 2020 was 51 million compared to 62 million in 2019 and 87 million in 2018 the service cost component of our pension income is reflected in cost of products sold and sga expenses all other components of our pension income are reflected in other income 

our effective income tax rate was 223 percent in 2020 compared with 216 percent in 2019 and 204 percent in 2018 our effective income tax rate in 2020 and 2019 was higher compared to the prior years primarily due to a change in geographic earnings mix 

north america 

sales in our north america segment were 2118 million in 2020 or 34 million higher than sales of 2084 million in 2019 compared to 2019 the increased 2020 sales were primarily due to higher volumes of residential water heaters and a 25 percent increase in water treatment product sales including 16 million of incremental sales from waterright this increase was partially offset by lower us commercial water heater volumes lower boiler sales and a water heater sales mix composed of more electric models which have a lower selling price sales in our north america segment were 2084 million in 2019 or 39 million higher than sales of 2045 million in 2018 the increase in sales in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the incremental waterright sales of 44 million water heater pricing actions related to steel and freight cost increases and higher sales of water treatment products which were partially offset by lower residential water heater volumes 

north america segment earnings were 5035 million in 2020 compared to segment earnings of 4889 million and 4641 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively segment margins were 238 percent 235 percent and 227 percent in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin which exclude severance restructuring and impairment expenses were 5062 million and 239 percent respectively in 2020 and 4708 million and 230 percent respectively in 2018 the higher adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2020 compared to 2019 segment earnings and segment margin were primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes higher water treatment product sales which included incremental profit from waterright and lower material costs this was partially offset by lower volumes of commercial water heaters and lower boiler sales during 2020 segment earnings and margin were adversely impacted by certain costs related to the pandemic these costs included temporarily moving production from mexico to the us paying employees during temporary plant shutdowns proactively deep cleaning facilities paying benefits during employee furloughs and other costs which were approximately 66 million in 2020 the higher segment earnings and segment margin in 2019 compared to 2018 adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin were primarily a result of pricing actions lower steel costs and higher sales of water treatment products including incremental volumes from our acquisition waterright these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from lower residential water heater volumes we estimate our 2021 north america segment margin will be between 23 and 235 percent 

adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2020 exclude 27 million of pretax severance and restructuring and impairment expenses these expenses were associated with an initiative to align our business to current market conditions adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2018 exclude 67 million of pretax severance restructuring and impairment expenses these expenses were associated with our transfer of our water heater boiler and storage tank production from our renton washington plant to our other us plants 

rest of world 

sales in our rest of world segment were 800 million in 2020 or 136 million lower than sales of 936 million in 2019 compared to 2019 our sales in china decreased by 15 percent in us dollar terms and 16 percent in local currency in 2020 in addition our 2020 sales in china were favorably impacted by currency translation of approximately 9 million compared to 2019 due to the appreciation of the chinese currency compared to the us dollar the decrease in rest of world sales in 2020 was primarily due to covid19 pandemicrelated lockdowns weak endmarket demand in china primarily in the first half of 2020 a higher mix of midprice products which have a lower selling price and year over year channel inventory shifts sales in our rest of world segment in 2019 were 936 million or 238 million lower than sales of 1174 million in 2018 lower sales in 2019 compared to 2018 were largely a result of decreased china sales which declined 23 percent in us dollar terms and 19 percent in local currency terms the decline in china sales was primarily due to weaker endmarket demand elevated channel inventory levels for the first three quarters of 2019 that returned to a more normal range of two to three months by the end of 2019 and a higher mix of midprice products versus premiumpriced products in addition the weaker chinese currency unfavorably impacted translated sales by approximately 39 million sales in india grew approximately 13 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 

the rest of world segment was breakeven in 2020 compared to segment earnings of 402 million and 1493 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively segment margins were 43 percent and 127 percent in 2019 and 2018 respectively adjusted segment earnings and segment margin which exclude severance restructuring and impairment expenses were 50 million and one percent respectively in 2020 compared to 2019 the absence of segment earnings in 2020 was driven by the unfavorable impact from lower sales in china and a higher mix of midprice products which have lower margins than our historical mix of higherpriced products and which were partially offset by the benefits from lower selling advertising and administrative costs and temporary social insurance exemptions currency translation increased segment earnings by approximately 36 million in 2020 compared to 2019 the decline in 2019 segment earnings and margin compared to 2018 was primarily due to lower sales in china and a higher mix of midprice products which have lower margins that when combined more than offset benefits to profits from lower sga expenses and material costs in that region currency translation reduced segment earnings by approximately 30 million in 2019 compared to 2018 we expect fullyear segment margin to be between seven percent and eight percent in 2021 

adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2020 exclude 50 million of pretax severance and restructuring and impairment expenses these expenses were associated with an initiative to align our business to current market conditions 

liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital was 7317 million at december 31 2020 compared with 7339 million and 8532 million at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively an increase in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was offset by higher accounts payable balances and payroll accruals in 2020 compared to 2019 we repatriated approximately 190 million in foreign cash and marketable securities in 2020 and utilized it to repay floating rate debt the decline in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and sales related decreases in accounts receivable partially offset by lower accounts payable balances led to the majority of the decline in working capital in 2019 approximately 165 million in foreign cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was repatriated in 2019 and utilized to repay floating rate debt pay dividends and repurchase shares we expect to repatriate approximately 190 million in 2021 and use the proceeds for common stock repurchases 

cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was 5621 million compared with 4562 million during 2019 and 4489 million during 2018 the improvement in operating cash flows in 2020 was primarily due to lower outlays of working capital including higher accounts payable balances in china which include receipts of cash deposits in advance of sales from certain customers that more than offset lower earnings the increase in cash flows in 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily due to lower outlays for working capital which offset lower earnings in 2019 we expect cash provided by operating activities to be 450 million to 475 million in 2021 we continue to monitor developments on an ongoing basis and have taken proactive measures to focus on cash manage working capital and reduce costs 

our capital expenditures were 568 million in 2020 644 million in 2019 and 852 million in 2018 included in 2018 capital expenditures were approximately 13 million related to capacity expansion in china we project our 2021 capital expenditures to be between 85 and 90 million and expect depreciation and amortization will be approximately 80 million 

we have a 500 million multicurrency credit facility with a group of nine banks which expires in december 2021 the facility has an accordion provision which allows us to increase it up to 700 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31 2020 we expect to complete a renewal of our credit facility in the first half of 2021 

the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings as a result of the longterm nature of this facility our commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt as of december 31 2019 at december 31 2020 we had no borrowings under the facility and an available borrowing capacity of 500 million we believe the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flows will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

our total debt declined from 2840 million at december 31 2019 to 1132 million at december 31 2020 our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization calculated excluding operating lease liabilities was 58 percent at the end of 2020 compared with 146 percent at the end of 2019 

our us pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations we were not required to make a contribution to our pension plan in 2020 we forecast that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2021 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions in 2021 for further information on our pension plans see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the second quarter of 2019 our board of directors approved adding 3000000 shares of common stock to an existing discretionary share repurchase authority under the share repurchase program our common stock may be purchased through a combination of a rule 10b51 automatic trading plan and discretionary purchases in accordance with applicable securities laws the stock repurchase authorization remains effective until terminated by our board of directors which may occur at any time subject to the parameters of any rule 10b51 automatic trading plan that we may then have in effect due to the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the global covid19 pandemic we suspended our share repurchases on march 18 2020 during 2020 we repurchased 1348391 shares of our stock at a total cost of 567 million at december 31 2020 we had 1613824 million shares remaining on the board share repurchase authority on january 27 2021 the board of directors approved adding 7000000 shares of common stock to the existing discretionary share repurchase authority including the additional shares we have approximately 86 million shares available for repurchase we currently intend to spend approximately 400 million to repurchase common stock in 2021 through a combination of 10b51 plans and open market purchases 

we have paid dividends for 81 consecutive years with annual amounts increasing each of the last 29 years we paid dividends of 098 per share in 2020 compared with 090 per share in 2019 we increased our dividend by eight percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the fiveyear compound annual growth rate of our dividend payment is approximately 22 percent 

recent accounting pronouncements 

refer to recent accounting pronouncements in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we monitor these significant factors and adjustments are made as facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an armslength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct thorough and competent annual valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment in goodwill or indefinitelived assets in 2020 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed at least annually at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates the allocation of the warranty liability between current and 

longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates at december 31 2020 and 2019 our reserve for product warranties was 1423 million and 1343 million respectively 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year in 2020 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 75 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million 

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also utilize an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time at december 31 2020 and 2019 our reserve for product liability was 353 million and 331 million respectively 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on plan assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 675 and 715 percent in 2020 and 2019 respectively the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs decreased to 318 percent in 2020 from 432 percent in 2019 for 2021 our expected return on plan assets is 625 percent and our discount rate is 244 percent 

in developing our expected return on plan assets we evaluate our pension plan’s current and target asset allocation the expected longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is approximately 30 to 60 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers private equity managers and real estate managers our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2020 was 44 percent to equity managers 46 percent to bond managers nine percent to real estate managers and one percent to private equity managers we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical tenyear and 25year compounded annualized returns are 93 percent and 87 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the expected longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 625 percent expected return on plan assets for 2021 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2020 and 2019 were based on the aon aa only above median yield curve which was designed by aon to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the aa only above median yield curve represents a series of annual discount rates from bonds with aa minimum average rating as rated by moody’s investor service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

we recognized pension income of 51 million 62 million and 87 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

we made changes to our pension plan including closing the plan to new entrants effective january 1 2010 and the sunset of our plan for the majority of our employees on december 31 2014 lowering the expected return on plan assets by 25 basis points would decrease our net pension income for 2020 by approximately 19 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2020 net pension income by approximately 04 million 

as part of our strategy to derisk our defined benefit pension plan the qualified defined benefit pension plan purchased a group annuity contract whereby an unrelated insurance company assumed a 23 million and 31 million obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees and beneficiaries in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

nongaap measures 

we provide nongaap measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share eps and adjusted segment earnings that exclude severance restructuring and impairment expenses in 2020 and 2018 

we believe that the measures of adjusted earnings adjusted eps and adjusted segment earnings provide useful information to investors about our performance and allow management and our investors to better understand our performance between periods without regard to items we do not consider to be a component of our core operating performance

3 in 2020 we recognized 50 million of severance and restructuring expenses in connection with our alignment of the business to current market conditions for additional information see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

outlook 

we expect our consolidated sales to increase approximately ten percent in 2021 we believe the chinese economy will improve in 2021 and expect that sales in china will increase by 20 to 21 percent in us dollar terms and 14 to 15 percent in local currency terms we expect to achieve fullyear earnings of between 240 and 250 per share our 2021 guidance excludes the potential impacts from future acquisitions and assumes that the conditions of our business environment and that of our suppliers and customers are similar for the remainder of the year to what we have experienced in recent months and do not deteriorate as a result of further restrictions or shutdowns due to the covid19 pandemic 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal foreign state local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2020 and we do not expect them to be material in any single year we have reserves associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves together with available insurance coverage are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

risk management 

our enterprise risk management erm process seeks to identify and address significant and material risks our erm process assesses manages and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the enterprise risk management  integrated framework 2017 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso we believe that risktaking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks we can mitigate risks and their impact on the company only to a limited extent 

a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them our other board committees also play a role in risk management as set forth in their respective charters 

our goal is to proactively manage risks using a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value however the risks set forth item 1a  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2020 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding with notional values of 2299 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in exchange rates would amount to 230 million however gains and losses from our forward contracts will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged

 item 1a – risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k

including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company

  

 

global economic growth remains uneven and could stall or reverse course if this was to occur it could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition or slower adoption of energyefficient water heaters and boilers or high quality water treatment products which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows in addition a deterioration in current economic conditions due to many factors or fears including public health crises such as the current coronavirus concerns originating in china could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials or increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

approximately 28 percent of our net sales in 2019 were attributable to china our sales in china decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 and 2017 we believe that decrease was due to weaker endmarket

demand as a result of a weakening chinese economy elevated channel inventory levels and a higher mix of midprice

products versus premium price products we derive a substantial portion of our sales in china from premiumtier products changes in consumer preferences weakening consumer confidence and sentiment as well as economic uncertainty including the unknown impact from the coronavirus may prompt consumers there to postpone purchases choose lowerpriced products or different alternatives or lengthen the cycle of replacement purchases further deterioration in the chinese economy may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

  

 

we sell all of our products in highly competitive and evolving markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing research and development and distribution resources than we have others may invest little in technology or product development but compete on price and the rapid replication of features benefits and technologies and some are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing or geographic footprints in north america the gas tankless portion of the water heating market has for many years increased as a percentage of the overall market while we have many gas tankless products our market share for gas tankless products is lower than our market share for the remainder of the water heating market further expansion of the gas tankless portion of the north america market which we believe was approximately nine percent of the residential market segment in 2019 could have an impact on our operating results we cannot assure that our products will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors there could be new market participants that change the dynamics of those markets and it is possible that we will not be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

consumer preferences for products and the methods in which they purchase products are constantly changing based on among other factors cost convenience environmental and social concerns and perceptions consumer purchasing behavior may shift the product mix in the markets we participate in or result in a shift to new distribution channels including ecommerce

which continues to expand for example consumer preferences may shift toward more efficient gas products or electric powered products due to the increased attention on the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment in addition technologies are ever changing our ability to timely develop and successfully market new products and to develop acquire and retain necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success but cannot reasonably be assured it is possible that we will not be able to develop new technologies products or distribution channels to align with consumer purchasing behavior and consumer preferences which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

  

 

as a global company with a large international footprint we are subject to increased risk of damage or disruption to us our employees facilities suppliers distributors or customers extraordinary events including natural disasters political disruptions terrorist attacks public health issues and acts of war may disrupt our business and operations impact our supply chain and access to necessary raw materials or could adversely affect the economy generally resulting in a loss of sales and customers one of our manufacturing plants is located within a floodplain that has experienced past flooding events we also have other manufacturing facilities located in hurricane and earthquake zones any of these disruptions or other extraordinary events outside of our control that impact our operations or the operations of our suppliers and key distributors could affect our business negatively harming operating results in addition these types of events also could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or depending on the severity globally which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for example a strain of coronavirus surfaced in wuhan china and has led to store closures and a decrease of consumer traffic in china while not yet quantifiable we expect the effects of the coronavirus to have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the first quarter of 2020 and we continue to assess the financial impact for the remainder of 2020 

 

  

 

approximately 36 percent of our net sales in 2019 were attributable to products sold outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent in europe and india we also have operations and business relationships outside the us that comprise a portion of our manufacturing supply and distribution approximately 8800 of our 15100 employees as of december 31 2019 were located in china at december 31 2019 approximately 549 million of cash and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of which were located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions or changes to trade agreements the impact of foreign government regulations actions or policies the effects of income taxes governmental expropriation the imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries labor relations problems the imposition of environmental or employment laws or other restrictions or actions by foreign governments and differences in business practices unfavorable changes in the political regulatory or trade climate diplomatic relations or government policies particularly in relation to countries where we have a presence including canada china india and mexico could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the us 

  

 

net sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 39 percent of our sales in 2019 we expect that our customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of customers makes our relationships with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may shift their purchases to our competitors in the future the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers or our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

residential and commercial construction activity in north america has shown modest growth which could decline in the future we believe that the significant majority of the markets we serve are for replacement of existing products and residential water heater replacement volume was strong in 2017 and 2018 before declining in 2019 changes in the replacement volume and in the construction market in north america could negatively affect us 

 

we have a significant presence outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent europe mexico and india and therefore hold assets including 443 million of cash and marketable securities denominated in chinese renminbi incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in our consolidated financial statements furthermore typically our products are priced in foreign countries in local currencies as a result we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates hyperinflation in some foreign countries or global exchange rate instability or volatility that strengthens the us dollar against foreign currencies as a result an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our foreign markets has had and would continue to have a negative effect on our profitability in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries’ functional currency the majority of our foreign currency transaction risk results from sales of our products in canada which we manufacture in the us and to a lesser extent from component purchases in europe and payroll in mexico these risks may hurt our reported sales and profits in the future or negatively impact revenues and earnings translated from foreign currencies into us dollars 

 

our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements related to among other items energy and water efficiency environmental emissions labeling and safety while we believe our products are currently efficient safe and environmentfriendly a significant change to regulatory requirements whether federal foreign state or local such as a transition to alternative energy sources as a replacement for gas combustion or to industry standards could substantially increase manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products affect the types of products we are able to offer or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

product defects can occur through our own product development design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities we may incur various expenses related to product defects including product warranty costs product liability and recall or retrofit costs while we maintain a reserve for product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve resulting in current period expenses and a need to increase our reserves for warranty charges in addition product defects and recalls may diminish the reputation of our brand further our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the market prices for certain raw materials we purchase primarily steel have been volatile significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in our ability to recover increased material costs from customers and that lag could negatively impact our profitability in addition in some cases we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components we require in the manufacturing of our products a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

in the ordinary course of business we utilize information systems for daytoday

operations to collect and store sensitive data and information including our proprietary and regulated business information and personally identifiable information of our customers suppliers and business partners as well as personally identifiable information about our employees our information systems like those of other companies are susceptible to outages due to system failures cybersecurity threats failures on the part of thirdparty information system providers natural disasters power loss telecommunications failures viruses fraud theft

malicious insiders or breaches of security we have a response plan in place in the event of a data breach and we continue to take steps to maintain and improve data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing and improving internal controls security technologies insurance programs network and data center resiliency and recovery processes however any operations failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to disruptions of our business activities the loss or disclosure of both our and our customers’ financial product and other confidential information and could result in regulatory actions and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our reputation 

 

due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a nonus

government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

our products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture sale and use of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will be able to ultimately pay all insured losses in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

attracting and retaining talented employees is important to the continued success and growth of our business failure to retain key personnel particularly on the leadership team could have a material effect on our business and our ability to execute our business strategies in a timely and effective manner 

 

the compound annual growth rate of our boiler sales has been approximately eight percent per year since our acquisition of lochinvar in 2011 largely due to the transition in the boiler industry in the us from lower efficiency noncondensing

boilers to higher efficiency higher priced condensing boilers as well as new product introductions we expect the transition to condensing boilers to continue but if the transition to higher efficiency higher priced condensing boilers stalls as a result of lower energy costs a us recession occurs or our competitors’ technologies surpass our technology our growth rate could be lower than expected and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and we could use a significant portion of our available capital to fund future acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions in new geographies our unfamiliarity with local regulations and market customs may impact our ability to operate them profitably or achieve our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing the impact of future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

our total assets include significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase prices we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there have been impairments in the value of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at our businesses does not meet expectations we may be required to reflect noncash

charges to operating results for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairments the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets may affect our ability to maintain the debttocapital

ratio required under our existing debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

the projected benefit obligation liability of our defined benefit pension plans of 869 million exceeded the fair value of the plan assets of 832 million by approximately 37 million at december 31 2019 us employees hired after january 1 2010 have not participated in our defined benefit plan and benefit accruals for the majority of current salaried and hourly employees ended on december 31 2014 we forecast that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2020 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions however we cannot provide any assurance that contributions will not be required in the future among the key assumptions inherent in our actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to making contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing our company 

 

we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock currently are entitled as a class to elect only onethird

of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit smith family have entered into a voting trust agreement with respect to shares of our class a common stock and shares of our common stock they own as of december 31 2019 through the voting trust these members of the smith family own approximately 637 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and common stock taken together as a single class and approximately 965 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock as a separate class due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock onetenth

of one vote per share and shares of our class a common stock one vote per share the smith family voting trust is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control this ownership position may increase if other members of the smith family enter into the voting trust agreement and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our class a common stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our common stock the voting trust agreement provides that in the event one of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our class a common stock such shares of our class a common stock are automatically exchanged for shares of our common stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust in addition the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our class a common stock and our common stock proposed to be withdrawn or transferred from the trust as a result the smith family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the smith family decide to transfer their shares

 item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview 

our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china europe and india both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas and electric water heaters boilers tanks and water treatment products both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective regions of the world our rest of world segment also manufactures and markets inhome

air purification products in china

in our north america segment we project our sales in the us will grow approximately six percent in 2020 compared to 2019 due to higher water heater and boiler volumes resulting from expected industrywide new construction growth and expansion of replacement demand we continued to expand our north america water treatment platform in 2019 by acquiring waterright inc and its affiliated entities waterright in april 2019 we expect sales of north america water treatment products to increase by 20 to 25 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to volume growth and a full year of waterright sales 

in our rest of world segment we expect 2020 china sales to grow by approximately one percent in us dollar terms and approximately 25 percent in local currency compared with 2019 as we believe the chinese economy will continue to be weak in addition we expect our sales in india to grow between 15 and 20 percent in 2020 from approximately 39 million in 2019 

combining all of these factors we expect our consolidated sales to grow 45 to 55 percent in 2020 our 2020 guidance introduced on january 28 2020 excludes the potential impact to our businesses from the coronavirus originating in china as of the date of this filing while not yet quantifiable we now expect the coronavirus will have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the first quarter of 2020 and we continue to assess the financial impact for the remainder of 2020 

our stated acquisition strategy includes a number of our waterrelated strategic initiatives we will seek to continue to grow our core residential and commercial water heating boiler and water treatment businesses throughout the world we will also continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing operations in high growth regions demonstrated by our introduction of water treatment products in india and vietnam and air purification products as well as range hoods and cooktops in china 

results of operations 

our sales in 2019 were 2993 million a decline of 61 percent compared to our 2018 sales of 3188 million the decrease in 2019 sales was primarily due to a 23 percent decline in china sales in us dollar terms which was largely a result of weaker endmarket 

demand in the region year over year channel inventory shifts and a higher mix of sales of midprice

products versus premium price products than in the prior year excluding the unfavorable impact from currency translation china sales declined 19 percent in 2019 the sales reduction in china more than offset the benefits of higher sales in north america which were primarily a result of higher sales of water treatment products including incremental sales from our acquisition waterright and water heater pricing actions related to steel and freight cost increases the increase in north america sales was partially offset by lower residential water heater volumes our sales in 2018 were a company record 3188 million surpassing 2017 sales of 2997 million by 64 percent the increase in sales in 2018 was primarily due to pricing actions related to higher steel costs and higher sales of boilers and residential water heaters in the us as well as higher sales of water treatment products in china our global water treatment sales grew to approximately 400 million in 2018 total sales in china grew four percent in 2018 excluding the impact of the appreciation of the chinese currency against the us dollar our sales in china increased almost two percent in 2018

our gross profit margin in 2019 of 395 percent declined compared to our gross profit margin of 410 percent in 2018 primarily due to the lower sales volumes in china and a higher mix of midprice

products which have lower margins in that region our gross profit margin in 2018 of 410 percent was essentially flat compared to our gross profit margin of 411 percent in 2017

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 7156 million in 2019 or 382 million lower than in 2018 the decrease in sga expenses in 2019 was primarily due to lower advertising and selling expenses in china sga expenses were 310 million higher in 2018 than in 2017 the increase in sga expenses in 2018 to 7538 million was primarily due to higher advertising expenses related to brand building and higher product development engineering expenses in china 

on march 21 2018 we announced a plan to transfer water heater boiler and storage tank production from our renton washington plant to our other us plants the majority of the consolidation of operations occurred in the second quarter of 2018 as a result of the relocation of production we incurred pretax

restructuring and impairment expenses of 67 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily related to employee severance and compensationrelated costs building lease exit costs and the impairment of assets these activities are reflected in “restructuring and impairment expenses” in the accompanying financial statements

we are providing nonus

generally accepted accounting principles gaap measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment earnings that exclude restructuring and impairment expenses reconciliations to measures on a gaap basis are provided later in this section we believe that the measures of adjusted earnings adjusted eps and adjusted segment earnings provide useful information to investors about our performance and allow management and our investors to better understand our performance between periods without regard to items we do not consider to be a component of our core operating performance

interest expense was 110 million in 2019 compared to 84 million in 2018 and 101 million in 2017 the increase in interest expense in 2019 was primarily due to higher debt levels to fund the acquisition of waterright and share repurchase activity the decline in interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was a result of lower debt levels primarily due to the repatriation of approximately 312 million of cash from outside of the us which was primarily used to pay down floating rate debt as well as to fund our share repurchase activity and dividend payments this decline was partially offset by higher interest rates in 2018 

other income was 180 million in 2019 compared to 212 million in 2018 and 213 million in 2017 the decrease in other income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to lower nonservice

cost related pension income and lower interest income

pension income in 2019 was 62 million compared to 87 million in 2018 and 91 million in 2017 the service cost component of our pension income is reflected in cost of products sold and sga expenses all other components of our pension income are reflected in other income 

our effective income tax rate was 216 percent in 2019 compared with 204 percent in 2018 and 431 percent in 2017 our effective income tax rates in 2019 and 2018 were lower than our adjusted effective income tax rate in 2017 due to lower federal income taxes related to the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 us tax reform our effective income tax rate in 2019 was higher than 2018 primarily due to a change in geographic earnings mix the effective income tax rate in 2017 was significantly higher due to onetime 

charges associated with us tax reform of 818 million primarily related to the mandatory repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings that we are required to pay over eight years excluding the impact of the us tax reform onetime

charges our adjusted effective income tax rate was 274 percent in 2017 we estimate our annual effective income tax rate for the full year 2020 will be approximately 215 to 220 percent

north america 

sales in our north america segment were 2084 million in 2019 or 39 million higher than sales of 2045 million in 2018 the increase in segment sales was primarily due to the incremental waterright sales of 44 million water heater pricing actions related to steel and freight cost increases and higher sales of water treatment products which were partially offset by lower residential water heater volumes sales in our north america segment were 2045 million in 2018 or 140 million higher than sales of 1905 million in 2017 the increase in sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to pricing actions related to higher steel costs and higher volumes of boilers and residential water heaters in the us north america water treatment sales including a full year of sales from hague which we purchased in 2017 and the launch of products at lowe’s commencing in august 2018 incrementally added approximately 29 million of sales in 2018 

north america segment earnings were 4889 million in 2019 compared to segment earnings of 4641 million and 4286 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively segment margins were 235 percent 227 percent and 225 percent in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively adjusted segment earnings and segment margin in 2018 which exclude restructuring and impairment expenses were 4708 million and 230 percent respectively the higher segment earnings and segment margin in 2019 compared to 2018 adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin were primarily a result of pricing actions lower steel costs and higher sales of water treatment products that included incremental volumes from our acquisition waterright these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from lower residential water heater volumes the higher adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2018 compared to 2017 were primarily due to the favorable impact from higher sales of residential water heaters and boilers and pricing actions in the us that were partially offset by higher steel costs and onetime

expenses associated with the launch of water treatment products at lowe’s we estimate our 2020 north america segment margin will be between 2325 and 2425 percent

rest of world 

sales in our rest of world segment in 2019 were 936 million or 238 million lower than sales of 1174 million in 2018 lower sales in 2019 compared to 2018 was largely a result of decreased china sales which declined 23 percent in us dollar terms and 19 percent in local currency terms the decline in china sales was primarily due to weaker endmarket

demand elevated channel inventory levels for the first three quarters of 2019 that returned to a more normal range of two to three months by the end of 2019 and a higher mix of midprice

products versus premium priced products in addition the weaker chinese currency

unfavorably impacted translated sales by approximately 39 million sales in india grew approximately 13 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 sales in china grew four percent in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher sales of water treatment products including consumables which were partially offset by lower sales of electric water heaters and air purifiers the appreciation of the chinese currency against the us dollar contributed approximately 23 million to segment sales in 2018 excluding the benefit of the chinese currency appreciation sales in china increased 19 percent in 2018 water heater and water treatment sales in india increased 8 million over 30 percent in 2018 compared to 2017 

rest of world segment earnings were 402 million in 2019 compared to segment earnings of 1493 million in both 2018 and 2017 segment margins were 43 percent in 2019 compared to 127 percent and 134 percent in 2018 and 2017 respectively the decline in 2019 segment earnings and margin compared to 2018 was primarily due to lower sales in china and a higher mix of midprice 

products which have lower margins that when combined more than offset benefits to profits from lower sga expenses and material costs in that region currency translation reduced segment earnings by approximately 30 million in 2019 compared to 2018 segment earnings in 2018 were flat compared to 2017 primarily due to higher water treatment product sales and improved performance in india that were offset by lower sales of electric water heaters and air purifiers in china as well as higher sga expenses higher sga expenses in china were primarily due to higher advertising expenses related to brand building and higher product development engineering expenses segment margin declined in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of the factors above we expect our 2020 rest of world segment margin will be approximately five percent

liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital was 7339 million at december 31 2019 compared with 8532 million and 9731 million at december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively approximately 165 million in foreign cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was repatriated in 2019 and utilized to repay floating rate debt pay dividends and repurchase shares the decline in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and salesrelated decreases in accounts receivable partially offset by lower accounts payable balances explains the majority of the decline in working capital in 2019 approximately 312 million in foreign cash was repatriated in 2018 and utilized to repay floating rate debt pay dividends and repurchase shares the decline in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances more than offset salesrelated increases in accounts receivable and explains the majority of the decline in working capital in 2018 as of december 31 2019 essentially all of our 5514 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to repatriate approximately 150 million in the first half of 2020 and use the proceeds to repay floating rate debt 

cash provided by operating activities during 2019 was 4562 million compared with 4489 million during 2018 and 3264 million during 2017 the increase in cash flows in 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily due to lower outlays for working capital which offset lower earnings in 2019 the increase in cash flows in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital in 2018 

our capital expenditures were 644 million in 2019 852 million in 2018 and 942 million in 2017 we broke ground in 2016 on the construction of a new water treatment and air purification products manufacturing facility in nanjing china to support the expected growth of these products in china the facility became operational in may 2018 included in 2018 capital expenditures were approximately 13 million related to capacity expansion in china included in 2017 capital expenditures were approximately 24 million related to capacity expansion in china for 2020 we project approximately 80 million of capital expenditures and approximately 85 million of depreciation and amortization expense 

in december 2016 we completed a 500 million multicurrency fiveyear revolving credit facility with a group of nine banks the facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to 700 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31 2019 the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings and it expires on december 15 2021 as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt 

at december 31 2019 we had available borrowing capacity of 3360 million under this facility we believe that our combination of cash available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

our total debt increased to 2840 million at december 31 2019 compared with 2214 million at december 31 2018 we repatriated approximately 150 million cash and paid down debt which was more than offset by the purchase of waterright and share repurchase activity exceeding cash generation in the us as a result our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 146 percent at the end of 2019 compared with 114 percent at the end of 2018 

our us pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations we were not required to make a contribution to our pension plan in 2019 we forecast that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2020 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions in 2020 for further information on our pension plans see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

in 2019 we repurchased 6113038 shares at an average price of 4706 per share and a total cost of 2877 million our board of directors increased the number of shares we are authorized to repurchase by 3000000 shares at its june 2019 meeting a total of 2962215 shares remained on the existing repurchase authorization at december 31 2019 depending on factors such as stock price working capital requirements and alternative investment opportunities such as acquisitions we expect to spend approximately 200 million on share repurchase activity in 2020 using a combination of a 10b51

repurchase plan and opportunistic purchases

we have paid dividends for 80 consecutive years with annual amounts increasing each of the last 28 years we paid dividends of 090 per share in 2019 compared with 076 per share in 2018 we increased our dividend by nine percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fiveyear compound annual growth rate of our dividend is approximately 25 percent 

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 is as follows 

  

as of december 31 2019 our liability for uncertain income tax positions was 97 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to our scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments that we consider firm

in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we monitor these significant factors and adjustments are made as facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an armslength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct thorough and competent annual valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment in goodwill or indefinitelived assets in 2019 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed at least annually at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates at december 31 2019 and 2018 our reserve for product warranties was 1343 million and 1394 million respectively 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year in 2019 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 75 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million 

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also utilize an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time at december 31 2019 and 2018 our reserve for product liability was 331 million and 393 million respectively 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on plan assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 715 percent in 2019 and 2018 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs increased to 432 percent in 2019 from 365 percent in 2018 for 2020 our expected return on plan assets is 675 percent and our discount rate is 318 percent 

in developing our expected return on plan assets we evaluate our pension plan’s current and target asset allocation the expected longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is approximately 30 to 60 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers private equity managers and real estate managers our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2019 was 42 percent to equity managers 47 percent to bond managers 10 percent to real estate managers and one percent to private equity managers we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical tenyear

and 25year

compounded annualized returns are 92 percent and 93 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the expected longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 675 percent expected return on plan assets for 2020 is reasonable

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2019 and 2018 were based on the aon aa only above median yield curve which was designed by aon to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the aa only above median yield curve represents a series of annual discount rates from bonds with aa minimum average rating as rated by moody’s investor service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

we recognized pension income of 62 million 87 million and 91 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

costs associated with our replacement retirement plan in 2019 were approximately 6 million consistent with 2018 we made changes to our pension plan including closing the plan to new entrants effective january 1 2010 and the sunset of our plan for the majority of our employees on december 31 2014 lowering the expected return on plan assets by 25 basis points would decrease our net pension income for 2019 by approximately 19 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2019 net pension income by approximately 04 million 

in 2019 as part of our strategy to derisk

our defined benefit pension plan the qualified defined benefit pension plan purchased a group annuity contract whereby an unrelated insurance company assumed a 31 million obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees and beneficiaries

outlook 

we expect higher boiler water heater and water treatment sales in north america in 2020 and project segment sales to grow by approximately six percent compared to 2019 although china channel inventory levels have normalized to the range of two to three months we believe the chinese economy will remain weak in 2020 and expect that 2020 sales in china will increase by one percent in us dollar terms and 25 percent in local currency terms as a result we expect our consolidated sales to grow between 45 to 55 percent in 2020 we plan to achieve fullyear earnings of between 240 and 250 per share which excludes the potential impacts from future acquisitions our 2020 guidance above which was introduced on january 28 2020 excludes the potential impact on our businesses from the coronavirus originating in china as of the date of this filing while not yet quantifiable we now expect the effects of the coronavirus to have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the first quarter of 2020 and we continue to assess the financial impact for the remainder of the year 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal foreign state local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2019 and we do not expect them to be material in any single year we have reserves associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves together with available insurance coverage are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2019 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding with notional values of 2056 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in exchange rates would amount to 206 million however gains and losses from our forward contracts will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2019 we had 1640 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 25 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend 

average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax

interest expense of approximately 04 million

 item   1a – risk factors 

tableend you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

 

 global economic growth remains uneven and could stall or reverse course if this were to occur it could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition or slower adoption of energy efficient water heaters and boilers or high quality water treatment products which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows in addition a deterioration in current economic conditions including credit market conditions could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials or increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 approximately 43 percent of our net sales in 2018 were attributable to products sold outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent in europe and india we also have operations and business relationships outside the us that comprise a portion of our manufacturing supply and distribution approximately 10000 of our 16300 employees as of december 31 2018 were located in china at december 31 2018 approximately 644 million of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of which was located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions or changes to trade agreements the impact of foreign government regulations actions or policies the effects of income taxes governmental expropriation the imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries labor relations problems the imposition of environmental or employment laws or other restrictions or actions by foreign governments and differences in business practices unfavorable changes in the political regulatory or trade climate diplomatic relations or government policies particularly in relation to countries where we have a presence including canada china india and mexico could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the us 

 

 approximately 34 percent of our net sales in 2018 were attributable to china our sales growth in china decreased in 2018 we believe that decrease was due to weakness in the housing market in china weakening consumer sentiment in part associated with concerns about the trade tensions between china and the us and a weakening chinese economy we derive a substantial portion of our sales in china from premiumtier products and weakening consumer confidence and sentiment as well as economic uncertainty may prompt consumers there to choose lowerpriced alternatives or lengthen the cycle of replacement purchases further deterioration in the chinese economy could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 net sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 39 percent of our sales in 2018 we expect that our customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may shift their purchases to our competitors in the future the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers or our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we have significant operations outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent europe and india and therefore hold assets including 539 million of cash denominated in local currency in china incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in our consolidated financial statements as a result we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates hyperinflation in some foreign countries or global exchange rate instability or volatility that strengthens the us dollar against foreign currencies furthermore typically our products are priced in foreign countries in local currencies as a result an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our foreign markets has had and would continue to have a negative effect on our profitability in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries’ functional currency the majority of our foreign currency transaction risk results from sales of our products in canada which we manufacture in the us these risks may hurt our reported sales and profits in the future or negatively impact revenues and earnings translated from foreign currencies into us dollars 

 

 residential and commercial construction activity in north america has shown modest growth and activity could decline again in the future we believe that the majority of the markets we serve are for replacement of existing products and replacement related volume growth was strong in 2018 changes in replacement volume and in the construction market could negatively affect us 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive and evolving markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing research and development and distribution resources than we have and some are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing or geographic footprints consumer purchasing behavior may shift the product mix in the market or result in a shift to new distribution channels including ecommerce which is a rapidly developing area development of a successful ecommerce strategy involves significant time investment and resources in north america the tankless portion of the water heating market has for many years increased as a percentage of the overall market while we have many tankless products our market share for tankless products is lower than our market share for the remainder of the water heating market further acceleration of the tankless portion of the north america market which we believe was less than eight percent of the market in 2018 could have an impact on our operating results we cannot assure that our products will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors there could be new market participants that change the dynamics of those markets and it is possible that we will not be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our success may depend on our ability to adapt to technological changes in the water heating boiler water treatment and air purifier industries if we are unable to timely develop and introduce new products or enhance existing products in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or demands our competitiveness could be materially and adversely affected our ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop acquire and retain necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success but cannot reasonably be assured 

 

 our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements related to among other items energy and water efficiency environmental emissions labeling and safety while we believe our products are currently efficient safe and environmentfriendly a significant change to regulatory requirements whether federal foreign state or local such as electrification as a replacement for gas combustion or to industry standards could substantially increase 

 

manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products affect the types of products we are able to offer or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 product defects can occur through our own product development design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities we may incur various expenses related to product defects including product warranty costs product liability and recall or retrofit costs while we maintain a reserve for product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve resulting in current period expenses and a need to increase our reserves for warranty charges in addition product defects and recalls may diminish the reputation of our brand further our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the market prices for certain raw materials we purchase primarily steel have been volatile significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in our ability to recover increased material costs from customers and that lag could negatively impact our profitability in addition in some cases we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components we require in the manufacture of our products a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 in the ordinary course of business we utilize information systems for daytoday operations to collect and store sensitive data and information including our proprietary and regulated business information and personally identifiable information of our customers suppliers and business partners as well as personally identifiable information about our employees our information systems like those of other companies are susceptible to outages due to system failures cybersecurity threats failures on the part of thirdparty information system providers natural disasters power loss telecommunications failures viruses fraud theft malicious insiders or breaches of security we continue to take steps to maintain and improve data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing and improving internal controls security technologies insurance programs network and data center resiliency and recovery processes however any operations failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to disruptions of our business activities the loss or disclosure of both our and our customers’ financial product and other confidential information and could result in regulatory actions and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our reputation 

 

 due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a nonus government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture sale and use of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will be able to ultimately pay all insured losses in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 attracting and retaining talented employees is important to the continued success and growth of our business failure to retain key personnel particularly on the leadership team could have a material effect on our business and our ability to execute our business strategies in a timely and effective manner 

 

 the compound annual growth rate of our boiler sales has been approximately ten percent per year since our acquisition of lochinvar in 2011 largely due to the transition in the boiler industry in the us from lower efficiency noncondensing boilers to higher efficiency higher priced condensing boilers as well as new product introductions we expect the transition to condensing boilers to continue but if the transition to higher efficiency higher priced condensing boilers stalls as a result of lower energy costs a us recession occurs or our competitors’ technologies surpass our technology our growth rate could be lower than expected 

 

 we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and we could use a significant portion of our available capital to fund future acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions in new geographies our unfamiliarity with local regulations and market customs may impact our ability to operate them profitably or achieve our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing the impact of future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the projected benefit obligation liability of our defined benefit pension plans of 834 million exceeded the fair value of the plan assets of 778 million by approximately 56 million at december 31 2018 us employees hired after january 1 2010 have not participated in our defined benefit plan and benefit accruals for the majority of current salaried and hourly employees ended on december 31 2014 we are forecasting that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2019 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions however we cannot provide any assurance that contributions will not be required in the future among the key assumptions inherent in our actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to making the contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing the company 

 

 our total assets include significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase prices we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there have been impairments in the value of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at our businesses does not meet expectations we may be required to reflect noncash charges to operating results for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairments the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets may affect our ability to maintain the debttocapital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock currently are entitled as a class to elect only onethird of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit smith family have entered into a voting trust agreement with respect to shares of our class a common stock and shares of our common stock they own as of december 31 2018 through the voting trust these members of the smith family own approximately 629 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and common stock taken together as a single class and approximately 965 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock as a separate class due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock onetenth of one vote per share and shares of our class a common stock one vote per share the smith family voting trust is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control this ownership position may increase if other members of the smith family enter into the voting trust agreement and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our class a common stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our common stock the voting trust agreement provides that in the event one of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our class a common stock such shares of our class a common stock are automatically exchanged for shares of our common stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust in addition the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our class a common stock and our common stock proposed to be withdrawn or transferred from the trust as a result the smith family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the smith family decide to transfer their shares

 item   7  management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china europe and india both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas and electric water heaters boilers tanks and water treatment products both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective regions of the world our rest of world segment also manufactures and markets inhome air purification products in china 

in our north america segment we project our sales in the us will grow in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher residential water heater and boiler volumes resulting from expected industrywide new construction growth and expansion of replacement demand we expect the north america commercial water heater industry to be flat in 2019 after declining over five percent in 2018 following growth of 11 percent in 2017 partially due to an anticipated regulatory change our sales of boilers grew nine percent in 2018 and we expect ten percent sales growth in 2019 driven by the continuing us industry transition to higher efficiency products and our introduction of new products we continued to expand our north america water treatment platform in 2018 by being named exclusive supplier of water treatment products to lowe’s with sales commencing in august 2018 we expect sales of north america water treatment products to increase by 35 to 40 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to volume growth and a full year of sales to lowe’s 

in our rest of world segment we expect china sales to decline in 2019 at a rate of between seven and 10 percent in us dollars and three to six percent in local currency as we believe the chinese economy will continue to be weak and the chinese currency will depreciate compared to the us dollar by approximately four percent in 2019 compared with 2018 in addition we expect our sales in india to grow over 30 percent in 2019 from approximately 34 million in 2018 

combining all of these factors we expect our consolidated sales to grow one to 25 percent and between 25 to four percent in local currency terms in 2019 

our stated acquisition strategy includes a number of our waterrelated strategic initiatives we will seek to continue to grow our core residential and commercial water heating boiler and water treatment businesses throughout the world we will also continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing operations in high growth regions demonstrated by our introduction of water treatment products in india and vietnam and air purification products in china in 2015 

results of operations 

our sales in 2018 were a company record 3188 million surpassing 2017 sales of 2997 million by 64 percent the increase in sales in 2018 was primarily due to pricing actions related to higher steel costs and higher sales of boilers and residential water heaters in the us as well as higher sales of water treatment products in china our global water treatment sales grew to approximately 400 million in 2018 sales in china grew four percent in 2018 excluding the impact of the appreciation of the us dollar against the chinese currency our sales in china increased almost two percent in 2018 our sales in 2017 were higher than 2016 sales of 2686 million by 116 percent primarily due to higher sales in china as well as higher sales of water heaters and boilers in north america our sales in china grew 159 percent in 2017 to over 1 billion and excluding the impact of the appreciation of the us dollar against the chinese currency sales in china grew 179 percent in 2017 compared to 2016 

our gross profit margin in 2018 of 410 percent was essentially flat compared to our gross profit margin of 411 percent in 2017 our gross profit margin in 2017 decreased from 415 percent in 2016 the slightly lower margin in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to significantly higher steel costs that more than offset pricing actions taken in 2017 in north america and china 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 310 million higher in 2018 than in 2017 the increase in sga expenses in 2018 to 7538 million was primarily due to higher advertising expenses related to brand building and higher product development engineering expenses in china sga expenses were 603 million higher in 2017 than in 2016 primarily due to higher selling and advertising expenses to support increased volumes and brand building in our newer product categories 

on march 21 2018 we announced a plan to close our renton washington plant and transfer water heater boiler and storage tank production to our other us plants the majority of the consolidation of operations occurred in the second quarter of 2018 and the renton plant was fully closed in the third quarter of 2018 as a result of the relocation of production we incurred pretax restructuring and impairment expenses of 67 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily related to employee severance and compensationrelated costs building lease exit costs and the impairment of assets these activities are reflected in “restructuring and impairment expenses” in the accompanying financial statements 

 

we are providing nongaap measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share eps and adjusted segment earnings that exclude renton related restructuring and impairment expenses and onetime expenses associated with the us tax cuts  jobs act us tax reform reconciliations to measures on a gaap basis are provided later in this section 

interest expense was 84 million in 2018 compared to 101 million in 2017 and 73 million in 2016 higher interest rates in 2018 were offset by lower debt levels primarily due to the repatriation of approximately 312 million of cash from outside of the us which was primarily used to pay down floating rate debt as well as to fund our share repurchase activity and dividend payments the higher interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily related to higher interest rates as well as higher overall debt levels primarily due to increased share repurchases and acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 

other income was 212 million in 2018 compared to 213 million in 2017 and 181 million in 2016 the increase in other income in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher nonservice cost related pension income and higher interest income 

pension income in 2018 was 87 million compared to 91 million in 2017 and 69 million in 2016 the service cost component of our pension income is reflected in cost of products sold and sga expenses all other components of our pension income are reflected in other income 

our effective income tax rate was 204 percent in 2018 compared with 431 percent in 2017 and 294 percent in 2016 the significant increase in our effective income tax rate in 2017 compared to prior years was due to onetime charges associated with us tax reform of 818 million primarily related to the mandatory repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings that we are required to pay over eight years excluding the impact of the us tax reform onetime charges our adjusted effective income tax rate was 274 percent in 2017 our effective income tax rate in 2018 was lower than our adjusted effective income tax rate in 2017 due to lower federal income taxes related to us tax reform our adjusted effective income tax rate in 2017 was lower than our effective income tax rate in 2016 primarily due to lower us state income taxes and higher deductions for sharebased compensation we estimate our annual effective income tax rate for the full year 2019 will be approximately 215 percent

sales in our north america segment were 2045 million in 2018 or 140 million higher than sales of 1905 million in 2017 the increase in sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to pricing actions related to higher steel costs and higher volumes of boilers and residential water heaters in the us north america water treatment sales including a full year of sales from hague and the launch of products at lowe’s commencing in august 2018 incrementally added approximately 29 million of sales in 2018 sales in 2017 were 162 million higher than sales of 1743 million in 2016 the increase in sales in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher volumes of water heaters and boilers price increases in the us for water heaters largely related to steel cost increases as well as our customers’ prebuy of commercial water heaters in advance of an anticipated 2018 regulatory change north america water treatment sales comprised of hague acquired in september 2017 and aquasana acquired in august 2016 incrementally added approximately 40 million of sales in 2017 

north america segment earnings were 4641 million in 2018 compared to segment earnings of 4286 million and 3859 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively segment margins were 227 percent 225 percent and 221 percent in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively adjusted segment earnings and segment margin in 2018 which exclude restructuring and impairment expenses were 4708 million and 230 percent respectively the higher adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2018 compared to 2017 were primarily due to the favorable impact from higher sales of residential water heaters and boilers and pricing actions in the us that were partially offset by higher steel costs and onetime expenses associated with the launch of water treatment products at lowe’s the higher segment earnings and segment margin in 2017 compared to 2016 were primarily due to higher water heater and boiler volumes and pricing actions which were partially offset by higher steel costs we estimate our 2019 north america segment margin will be between 23 and 235 percent 

rest of world 

sales in our rest of world segment in 2018 were 1174 million or 58 million higher than sales of 1116 million in 2017 sales in china grew four percent in 2018 primarily due to higher sales of water treatment products including consumables which were partially offset by lower sales of electric water heaters and air purifiers the appreciation of the us dollar against the chinese currency contributed approximately 23 million to segment sales in 2018 excluding the benefit of the us dollar appreciation sales in china increased 19 percent in 2018 water heater and water treatment sales in india increased 8 million over 30 percent in 2018 compared to 2017 sales in our rest of world segment in 2017 were 150 million higher than sales of 966 million in 2016 sales in china grew 159 percent to over 1 billion in 2017 due to higher demand for our 

 

consumer products led by water treatment and air purification products and pricing actions primarily due to higher steel and installation costs excluding the impact from the appreciation of the us dollar in 2017 sales in china increased 179 percent water heater and water treatment sales in india increased 8 million over 40 percent in 2017 compared to 2016 

rest of world segment earnings were 1493 million in 2018 compared to segment earnings of 1493 million and 1291 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively segment margins were 127 percent in 2018 compared to 134 percent and 134 percent in 2017 and 2016 respectively segment earnings in 2018 were flat compared to 2017 primarily due to higher water treatment product sales and improved performance in india that were offset by lower sales of electric water heaters and air purifiers as well as higher sga expenses higher sga expenses in china were primarily due to higher advertising expenses related to brand building and higher product development engineering expenses segment margin declined in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of the factors above higher segment earnings in 2017 compared to 2016 were primarily due to higher sales in china which included a price increase partially offset by higher steel costs higher fees paid to installers and increased sga expenses higher sga expenses in china were primarily due to the expansion of water treatment and air purification product retail outlets in tier 2 and tier 3 cities higher advertising expenses related to brand building in our newer product categories and higher water treatment product development engineering costs we expect our 2019 rest of world segment margin will be approximately 12 to 125 percent due to lower sales and profitability in china 

liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital was 8532 million at december 31 2018 compared with 9731 million and 7912 million at december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 respectively approximately 312 million in foreign cash was repatriated in 2018 and utilized to repay floating rate debt pay dividends and repurchase shares the decline in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances more than offset salesrelated increases in accounts receivable and explains the majority of the decline in working capital in 2018 cash generation in china and salesrelated increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels led to the majority of the increase in working capital in 2017 as of december 31 2018 essentially all of our 6450 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries we expect to repatriate approximately 150 million in the first half of 2019 and use the proceeds to repay floating rate debt 

cash provided by operating activities during 2018 was 4489 million compared with 3264 million during 2017 and 4466 million during 2016 the increase in cash flows in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital in 2018 the decline in cash flows in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher outlays for working capital than the below normal levels experienced in 2016 which more than offset the impact of higher earnings in 2017 

our capital expenditures were 852 million in 2018 942 million in 2017 and 807 million in 2016 we broke ground in 2016 on the construction of a new water treatment and air purification products manufacturing facility in nanjing china to support the expected growth of these products in china the facility became operational in may 2018 included in 2018 capital expenditures were approximately 13 million related to capacity expansion in china included in 2017 capital expenditures were approximately 24 million related to capacity expansion in china included in 2016 capital expenditures were approximately 13 million related to capacity expansion in china as well as approximately 11 million related to the continuation of our enterprise resource planning erp system implementation for 2019 we project approximately 85 million of capital expenditures and approximately 75 million of depreciation and amortization expense 

in november 2016 we issued 45 million of fixed rate term notes in two tranches to two insurance companies principal payments commence in 2023 and 2028 and the notes mature in 2029 and 2034 respectively the notes carry interest rates of 287 and 310 respectively we used proceeds of the notes to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

in december 2016 we completed a 500 million multicurrency five year revolving credit facility with a group of nine banks the facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to 700 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31 2018 the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings and it expires on december 15 2021 as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt 

 

at december 31 2018 we had available borrowing capacity of 3986 million under this facility we believe that our combination of cash available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

our total debt declined to 2214 million at december 31 2018 compared with 4104 million at december 31 2017 we repatriated approximately 312 million cash and paid down debt which was partially offset by share repurchase activity exceeding cash generation in the us as a result our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 114 percent at the end of 2018 compared with 199 percent at the end of 2017 

our us pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations we were not required to make a contribution to our pension plan in 2018 we forecast that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2019 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions in 2019 for further information on our pension plans see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in 2018 we repurchased 3797800 shares at an average price of 5334 per share and a total cost of 2026 million our board of directors increased the number of shares we are authorized to repurchase by 2500000 shares and 5000000 shares at its july 2018 and december 2018 meetings respectively a total of 6075253 shares remained on the existing repurchase authorization at december 31 2018 depending on factors such as stock price working capital requirements and alternative investment opportunities such as acquisitions we expect to spend approximately 200 million on share repurchase activity in 2019 using a combination of a 10b51 repurchase plan and opportunistic purchases 

we have paid dividends for 79 consecutive years with annual amounts increasing each of the last 27 years we paid dividends of 076 per share in 2018 compared with 056 per share in 2017 we increased our dividend rate twice in 2018 and the five year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is approximately 30 percent 

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018 is as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2018 our liability for uncertain income tax positions was 83 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to our scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments that we consider firm 

recent accounting pronouncements 

refer to recent accounting pronouncements in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we monitor these significant factors and adjustments are made as facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arm’slength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct thorough and competent annual valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment in goodwill or indefinitelived assets in 2018 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed at least annually at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates at december 31 2018 and 2017 our reserve for product warranties was 1393 million and 1412 million respectively 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year in 2018 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 75 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million 

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also utilize an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time at december 31 2018 and 2017 our reserve for product liability was 393 million and 401 million respectively 

 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on plan assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 715 percent in 2018 and 750 percent in 2017 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs decreased to 365 percent in 2018 from 415 percent in 2017 for 2019 our expected return on plan assets is 715 percent and our discount rate is 432 percent 

in developing our expected return on plan assets we evaluate our pension plan’s current and target asset allocation the expected longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is approximately 30 to 60 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers private equity managers and real estate managers our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2018 was 40 percent to equity managers 48 percent to bond managers 10 percent to real estate managers and two percent to private equity managers we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical tenyear and 25year compounded annualized returns are 89 percent and 85 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the expected longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 715 percent expected return on plan assets for 2019 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2018 and 2017 were based on the aon aa only above median yield curve which was designed by aon to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the aa only above median yield curve represents a series of annual discount rates from bonds with aa minimum average rating as rated by moody’s investor service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

we recognized pension income of 87 million 91 million and 69 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

costs associated with our replacement retirement plan in 2018 were approximately 6 million consistent with 2017 we made changes to our pension plan including closing the plan to new entrants effective january 1 2010 and the sunset of our plan for the majority of our employees on december 31 2014 lowering the expected return on plan assets by 25 basis points would decrease our net pension income for 2018 by approximately 20 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2018 net pension income by approximately 01 million 

nongaap measures 

we provide nongaap measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share eps and adjusted segment earnings that exclude restructuring and impairment expenses in 2018 and the impact of a onetime charge associated with us tax reform in 2017 

we believe that the measures of adjusted earnings adjusted eps and adjusted segment earnings provide useful information to investors about our performance and allow management and our investors to better compare our performance year over year

  outlook 

we expect continued strong boiler and residential water heater sales in north america in 2019 we project that sales in china will decline by seven to ten percent in us dollar terms and three to six percent in local currency in 2019 the decrease is due to our expectation of relatively flat consumer demand in china and without the increase of the channel inventory build in china that we experienced primarily in the first quarter of 2018 which we estimate was at least five percent of 2018 china sales as a result we expect our consolidated sales to grow one to 25 percent and between 25 to four percent in local currency terms in 2019 we expect to achieve fullyear earnings of between 267 and 277 per share which excludes the potential impact from future acquisitions 

 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal foreign state local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2018 and we do not expect them to be material in any single year we have reserves associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves together with available insurance coverage are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2018 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding with notional values of 2109 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in exchange rates would amount to 211 million however gains and losses from our forward contracts will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2018 we had 1014 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 29 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 03 million

 item   1a – risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

 

 global economic growth remains uneven and could stall or reverse course if this were to occur it could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition or slower adoption of energy efficient water heaters and boilers or high quality water treatment products which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows in addition a deterioration in current economic conditions including credit market conditions could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials or increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 approximately 43 percent of our net sales in 2017 were attributable to products sold outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent in europe and india we also have operations and business relationships outside the us that comprise a portion of our manufacturing supply and distribution approximately 10000 of our 16100 employees as of december 31 2017 were located in china at december 31 2017 approximately 815 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries 587 million of which was located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions the imposition of tariffs or other trade restrictions or changes to trade agreements the impact of foreign government regulations actions or policies the effects of income taxes governmental expropriation the imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries labor relations problems the imposition of environmental or employment laws or other restrictions or actions by foreign governments and differences in business practices unfavorable changes in the political regulatory or trade climate diplomatic relations or government policies particularly in relation to countries where we have a presence including canada china india and mexico could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the us 

 

 our sales growth in china has averaged approximately 175 percent per year in local currency over the past three years and we anticipate sales growth of approximately 13 percent in local currency in 2018 we expanded our water heater capacity substantially over the last few years and we are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity for water treatment and air purification products in china to meet local demand if there is a slowdown in the transition to a more consumer driven economy or the rate of urbanization was to stall it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 net sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 38 percent of our sales in 2017 we expect that our customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may shift their purchases to our competitors in the future the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers or our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we have significant operations outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent europe and india and therefore hold assets including 587 million of cash in china incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in our consolidated financial statements as a result we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates or hyperinflation in some foreign countries furthermore typically our products are priced in foreign countries in local currencies as a result an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our foreign markets has had and would continue to have a negative effect on our profitability in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries’ functional currency the majority of our foreign currency transaction risk results from sales of our products in canada which we manufacture in the us these risks may hurt our reported sales and profits in the future or negatively impact revenues and earnings translated from foreign currencies into us dollars 

 

 residential and commercial construction activity in north america has shown modest growth and activity could decline again in the future we believe that the majority of the markets we serve are for replacement of existing products and replacement related volume growth was strong in 2017 changes in replacement volume and in the construction market could negatively affect us 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing research and development and distribution resources than we have and some are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing or geographic footprints consumer purchasing behavior may shift to new distribution channels including ecommerce which is a rapidly developing area development of a successful ecommerce strategy involves significant time investment and resources we cannot assure that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our success may depend on our ability to adapt to technological changes in the water heating boiler water treatment and air purifier industries if we are unable to timely develop and introduce new products or enhance existing products in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or demands our competitiveness could be materially and adversely affected our ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop acquire and retain necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success but cannot reasonably be assured 

 

 our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements related to among other items energy efficiency environmental emissions labeling and safety while we believe our products are currently efficient safe and environmentfriendly a significant change to regulatory requirements whether federal foreign state or local or to industry standards could substantially increase manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act us tax reform was enacted effective january 1 2018 and contained substantial changes to the internal revenue code some of which could have an adverse effect on our business us tax reform significantly revises the us corporate income tax by among other things lowering corporate income tax rates implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries with the enactment of us tax reform our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2017 included provisional charges for income tax expense of approximately 818 million resulting from the deemed repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the recently enacted 21 percent us federal corporate income tax rate these provisional amounts are based on our initial analysis of us tax reform given the significant complexity of us tax reform anticipated guidance from the internal revenue service about implementing us tax reform and the potential for additional guidance from the securities and exchange commission or the financial accounting standards board related to us tax reform these provisional amounts may be adjusted in future periods during 2018 which could result in further impact to our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

 

 product defects can occur through our own product development design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities we may incur various expenses related to product defects including product warranty costs product liability and recall or retrofit costs while we maintain a reserve for product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve resulting in current period expenses and a need to increase our reserves for warranty charges in addition product defects and recalls may diminish the reputation of our brand further our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the market prices for certain raw materials we purchase primarily steel have been volatile significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in our ability to recover increased material costs from customers and that lag could negatively impact our profitability in addition in some cases we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components we require in the manufacture of our products a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a nonus government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture sale and use of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will be able to ultimately pay all insured losses in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 attracting and retaining talented employees is important to the continued success and growth of our business failure to retain key personnel particularly on the leadership team could have a material effect on our business and our ability to execute our business strategies in a timely and effective manner 

 

 the compound annual growth rate of our boiler sales has been approximately ten percent per year since our acquisition of lochinvar in 2011 largely due to the transition in the boiler industry in the us from lower efficiency noncondensing boilers to higher efficiency higher priced condensing boilers as well as new product introductions we expect the transition to condensing boilers to continue but if the transition to higher efficiency higher priced condensing boilers stalls as a result of lower energy costs a us recession occurs or our competitors’ technologies surpass our technology our growth rate could be lower than expected 

 

 in the ordinary course of business we utilize information systems for daytoday operations to collect and store sensitive data and information including our proprietary and regulated business information and personally identifiable information of our customers suppliers employees and business partners as well as personally identifiable information about our employees our information systems like those of other companies are susceptible to outages due to system failures failures on the part of thirdparty information system providers natural disasters power loss telecommunications failures viruses or breaches of security we continue to take steps to maintain and improve data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing and improving internal controls security technologies insurance programs network and data center resiliency and recovery processes however any operations failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to disruptions of our business activities the loss or disclosure of both our and our customers’ financial product and other confidential information and could result in regulatory actions and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our reputation 

 

 we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and we could use a significant portion of our available capital to fund future acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions in new geographies our unfamiliarity with local regulations and market customs may impact our ability to operate them profitably or achieve our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing the impact of future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately 48 million at december 31 2017 us employees hired after january 1 2010 have not participated in our defined benefit plan and benefit accruals for the majority of current salaried and hourly employees ended on december 31 2014 we are forecasting that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2018 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions however we cannot provide any assurance that contributions will not be required in the future among the key assumptions inherent in our actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to making the contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing the company 

 

 our total assets include significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase prices we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there have been impairments in the value of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at our businesses does not meet expectations we may be required to reflect noncash charges to operating results for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairments the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets may affect our ability to maintain the debttocapital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock currently are entitled as a class to elect only onethird of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit smith family have entered into a voting trust agreement with respect to shares of our class a common stock and shares of our common stock they own as of december 31 2017 through the voting trust these members of the smith family own approximately 623 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and common stock taken together as a single class and approximately 963 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock as a separate class due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock onetenth of one vote per share and shares of our class a common stock one vote per share the smith family voting trust is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control this ownership position may increase if other members of the smith family enter into the voting trust agreement and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our class a common stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our common stock the voting trust agreement provides that in the event one of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our class a common stock such shares of our class a common stock are automatically exchanged for shares of our common stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust in addition the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our class a common stock and our common stock proposed to be withdrawn or transferred from the trust as a result the smith family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the smith family decide to transfer their shares

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china europe and india both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas and electric water heaters boilers and water treatment products both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective regions of the world our north america segment also manufactures and markets water systems tanks our rest of world segment also manufactures and markets inhome air purification products in china 

in our north america segment we project our sales in the us will grow in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher residential water heater and boiler volumes resulting from expected industrywide new construction growth and expansion of replacement demand we expect the north america residential water heater industry to have three to 35 percent unit growth in 2018 due to nearly 20 percent unit growth in 2017 partially driven by an anticipated 2018 regulatory change and resulting prebuy we expect the north america commercial water heater industry to have a three percent unit decline in 2018 our sales of boilers grew 13 percent in 2017 and we expect ten percent sales growth in 2018 driven by the continuing us industry transition to higher efficiency products and our introduction of new products we continued to expand our north america water treatment platform with the acquisition of hague on september 5 2017 we expect sales of north america water treatment products to increase by approximately 50 percent in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to volume growth and a full year of hague sales 

in our rest of world segment we expect china sales to grow in 2018 at a rate of approximately 13 percent as we believe overall water heater market growth geographic expansion market share gains and growth in water treatment and air purification products will contribute to our growth in addition we expect our sales in india to grow over 40 percent in 2018 from approximately 26 million in 2017 

combining all of these factors we expect total company sales growth of between 85 percent to 95 percent in 2018 

our stated acquisition strategy includes a number of our waterrelated strategic initiatives we will look to continue to grow our core residential and commercial water heating boiler and water treatment businesses throughout the world we will also continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing operations in high growth regions demonstrated by our introduction in 2015 of air purification products in china and water treatment products in india and vietnam 

results of operations 

our sales in 2017 were a company record 2997 million surpassing 2016 sales of 2686 million by 116 percent the increase in sales in 2017 was primarily due to higher sales in china as well as higher sales of water heaters and boilers in north america sales in china grew 159 percent to over 1 billion in 2017 and excluding the impact of the appreciation of the us dollar sales in china increased 179 percent in 2017 our sales in 2016 were higher than 2015 sales of 2537 million by 59 percent in 2016 excluding the impact from the appreciation of the us dollar against the chinese currency our sales grew approximately eight percent sales in china grew 125 percent in 2016 and excluding the impact of the appreciation of the us dollar sales in china increased by 189 percent in 2016 

our gross profit margin in 2017 decreased to 413 percent from 417 percent in 2016 the slightly lower margin in 2017 was due to significantly higher steel costs that more than offset pricing actions taken in 2017 in north america and china our gross profit margin in 2016 increased from 398 percent in 2015 primarily due to price increases in the us lower material costs in the first half of 2016 and higher sales of boilers and commercial water heaters in the us than in 2015 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 593 million higher in 2017 than in 2016 the increase in sga expenses in 2017 to 7182 million was primarily due to higher selling and advertising expenses to support increased volumes and brand building in our newer product categories sga expenses were 482 million higher in 2016 than in 2015 primarily due to higher selling costs supporting our sales efforts in tier 2 and tier 3 cities in china as well as higher advertising costs to support brand building in china 

pension income in 2017 was 91 million compared to 69 million in 2016 and 01 million of pension expense in 2015 as of december 31 2015 we changed to what we believe is a more precise method to estimate the service cost and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for our pension and postretirement plans the change was the reason for 77 million and 71 million of decreases in 2017 and 2016 respectively compared to 2015 in service and interest costs 

 

interest expense was 101 million in 2017 compared to 73 million in 2016 and 74 million in 2015 the higher interest expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily related to higher interest rates as well as higher overall debt levels primarily due to increased share repurchases and acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 

other income was 104 million in 2017 compared to 94 million in 2016 and 108 million in 2015 the increase in other income in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher interest income the decrease in other income in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in interest income caused by lower interest rates in china in 2016 

our effective income tax rate was 431 percent in 2017 compared with 294 percent in 2016 and 297 percent in 2015 the significant increase in our effective income tax rate in 2017 compared to previous years was due to provisional onetime charges associated with the us tax cuts  jobs act us tax reform of 818 million primarily related to the mandatory repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings that we are required to pay over eight years excluding the impact of the us tax reform provisional onetime charges our adjusted effective income tax rate was 274 percent in 2017 our adjusted effective income tax rate in 2017 was lower than our effective income tax rate in 2016 primarily due to lower us state income taxes and higher deductions for sharebased compensation our lower effective income tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to our adoption of an accounting standard for sharebased compensation partially offset by a change in geographic earnings mix we estimate our annual effective income tax rate for the full year 2018 will be approximately 220 to 225 percent significantly lower than previous years due to us tax reform 

north america 

sales in our north america segment were 1905 million in 2017 or 162 million higher than sales of 1743 million in 2016 the increase in sales in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher volumes of water heaters and boilers price increases in the us for water heaters largely related to steel cost increases as well as our customer’s prebuy of commercial water heaters in advance of an anticipated 2018 regulatory change north america water treatment sales comprised of hague acquired in september 2017 and aquasana acquired in august 2016 incrementally added approximately 40 million of sales in 2017 sales in 2016 were 40 million higher than sales of 1703 million in 2015 the sales increase in 2016 resulted from a full year of us price increases for residential water heaters related to a regulatory change in april 2015 and a 2016 price increase in the us related to higher steel prices and other cost inflation sales in 2016 also benefitted from higher volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters in the us as well as the addition of 184 million of sales of water treatment products resulting from our aquasana acquisition lower volumes of us residential water heaters in 2016 compared to 2015 offset these benefits 

north america segment earnings were 4286 million in 2017 compared to segment earnings of 3859 million and 3399 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively segment margins were 225 percent 221 percent and 200 percent in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the higher segment earnings and segment margin in 2017 compared to 2016 were primarily due to higher water heater and boiler volumes and pricing actions which were partially offset by higher steel costs segment margin in 2017 also benefitted from lower sga expenses as a percent of sales the higher segment earnings and segment margin in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily due to pricing actions in the us lower material costs in the first half of 2016 and higher boiler and commercial water heater volumes in the us which were partially offset by lower us residential water heater volumes we estimate our 2018 north america segment margin will be between 22 and 225 percent primarily due to anticipated growth in boiler and residential water heater volumes offset by higher steel costs 

rest of world 

sales in our rest of world segment in 2017 were 1116 million or 150 million higher than sales of 966 million in 2016 sales in china grew 159 percent to over 1 billion in 2017 due to higher demand for our consumer products led by water treatment and air purification products and pricing actions primarily due to higher steel and installation costs excluding the impact from the appreciation of the us dollar in 2017 sales in china increased 179 percent water heater and water treatment sales in india increased 8 million over 40 percent in 2017 compared to 2016 sales in our rest of world segment in 2016 were 100 million higher than sales of 866 million in 2015 sales in china grew 125 percent in 2016 excluding the impact from the appreciation of the us dollar in 2016 sales in china increased 189 percent in 2016 driven by higher demand for water heaters water treatment products and residential air purification products water treatment sales in china totaled 177 million in 2016 compared to 130 million in 2015 sales of air purification products were 26 million in 2016 compared to 9 million in 2015 

rest of world segment earnings were 1493 million in 2017 compared to segment earnings of 1291 million and 1130 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively segment margins were 134 percent in 2017 compared to 134 percent and 130 percent in 2016 and 2015 respectively higher segment earnings in 2017 compared to 2016 were primarily due to higher sales in china which included a price increase partially offset by higher steel costs higher fees paid to installers and increased sga expenses higher sga expenses in china were primarily due to the expansion of water treatment and air purification product retail outlets in tier 2 and tier 3 cities higher advertising expenses related to brand building in our newer product 

 

categories and higher water treatment product development engineering costs higher segment earnings and segment margin in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily due to higher sales in china partially offset by increased sga expenses in china higher selling costs in china to support our sales efforts in tier 2 and tier 3 cities and higher advertising costs to support brand building were the primary drivers of higher sga expenses in 2016 operating earnings in 2016 were also negatively impacted by almost 8 million due to the appreciation of the us dollar in 2016 we expect 2018 rest of world segment margin to expand 30 to 40 basis points compared to 2017 

liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital was 9783 million at december 31 2017 compared with 7964 million and 7501 million at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 respectively cash generation in china and salesrelated increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels explain the majority of the increase in 2017 and 2016 as of december 31 2017 essentially all of our 8200 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries in december 2017 we recorded provisional onetime charges of 818 million primarily associated with the mandatory repatriation tax of undistributed foreign earnings under us tax reform in addition we had an existing accrual of 386 million associated with withholding taxes due upon issuance of foreign dividends we expect to repatriate approximately 200 million in the first half of 2018 and use the proceeds to repay floating rate debt 

cash provided by operating activities during 2017 was 3264 million compared with 4466 million during 2016 and 3517 million during 2015 the decline in cash flows in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher outlays for working capital than the below normal levels experienced in 2016 which more than offset the impact of higher earnings in 2017 the increase in cash flows in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to higher earnings from operations and lower outlays for working capital we experienced favorable cash flow impacts in china late in the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily from a series of unanticipated large customer payments including customer deposits 

over the twoyear period from 2016 to 2017 we generated operating cash of approximately 773 million which compares with 616 million of operating cash flows during 2014 to 2015 we anticipate cash provided by operating activities to be 475 to 500 million in 2018 compared to 326 million in 2017 due to higher projected earnings and lower outlays for working capital particularly inventory 

our capital expenditures were 942 million in 2017 807 million in 2016 and 727 million in 2015 we broke ground in 2016 on the construction of a new water treatment and air purification products manufacturing facility in nanjing china to support the expected growth of these products in china included in 2017 capital expenditures were approximately 24 million related to capacity expansion in china included in 2016 capital expenditures were approximately 13 million related to capacity expansion in china as well as approximately 11 million related to the continuation of our enterprise resource planning erp system implementation included in 2015 capital expenditures were approximately 16 million related to our erp implementation and approximately 19 million related to capacity expansion in china and the us to support growth we project approximately 100 million of capital expenditures in 2018 which includes approximately 30 million related to the completion of capacity expansion in china we project depreciation and amortization expense of approximately 80 million in 2018 

in january 2015 we issued 75 million of fixed rate term notes to an insurance company principal payments commence in 2020 and the notes mature in 2030 the notes carry an interest rate of 352 percent we used proceeds of the notes to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

in november 2016 we issued 45 million of fixed rate term notes in two tranches to two insurance companies principal payments commence in 2023 and 2028 and the notes mature in 2029 and 2034 respectively the notes carry interest rates of 287 and 310 respectively we used proceeds of the notes to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

in december 2016 we completed a 500 million multicurrency five year revolving credit facility with a group of nine banks the facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to 700 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31 2017 the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings and it expires on december 15 2021 as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt 

 

at december 31 2017 we had available borrowing capacity of 2171 million under this facility we believe that our combination of cash available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

our total debt increased to 4104 million at december 31 2017 compared with 3236 million at december 31 2016 as our cash flows generated in the us were more than offset by our share repurchase activity and our acquisition of hague as a result our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 199 percent at the end of 2017 compared with 176 percent at the end of 2016 

our us pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations we were not required to make a contribution to our pension plan in 2017 but made a voluntary 30 million contribution due to escalating pension benefit guaranty corporation insurance premiums we forecast that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2018 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions in 2018 for further information on our pension plans see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in 2017 we repurchased 2533350 shares at an average price of 5490 per share and a total cost of 1391 million a total of 2373053 shares remained on the existing repurchase authorization at december 31 2017 depending on factors such as stock price working capital requirements and alternative investment opportunities such as acquisitions we expect to spend approximately 135 million on share repurchase activity in 2018 using a 10b51 repurchase plan in addition we may opportunistically repurchase our shares in the open market in 2018 

we have paid dividends for 78 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 26 years we paid dividends of 056 per share in 2017 compared with 048 per share in 2016 in january 2018 we increased our dividend by 29 percent and anticipate paying dividends of 072 per share in 2018 

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2017 is as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2017 our liability for uncertain income tax positions was 62 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to our scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments that we consider firm 

recent accounting pronouncements 

refer to recent accounting pronouncements in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we monitor these significant factors and adjustments are made as facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arm’slength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct thorough and competent annual valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment in goodwill or indefinitelived assets in 2017 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed at least annually at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates at december 31 2017 and 2016 our reserve for product warranties was 1424 million and 1409 million respectively 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year in 2017 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 75 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million 

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also utilize an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time at december 31 2017 and 2016 our reserve for product liability was 401 million and 386 million respectively 

 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on plan assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 750 percent in 2017 and 2016 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs decreased to 415 percent in 2017 from 440 percent in 2016 for 2018 our expected return on plan assets is 715 percent and our discount rate is 365 percent 

in developing our expected return on plan assets we evaluate our pension plan’s current and target asset allocation the expected longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is approximately 45 to 55 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers private equity managers and real estate managers our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2017 was 45 percent to equity managers 43 percent to bond managers nine percent to real estate managers two percent to private equity managers and one percent to others we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical tenyear and 25year compounded annualized returns are 63 percent and 92 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the expected longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 715 percent expected return on plan assets for 2018 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2017 and 2016 were based on the aonhewitt aa only above median yield curve which was designed by aonhewitt to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the aa only above median yield curve represents a series of annual discount rates from bonds with aa minimum average rating as rated by moody’s investor service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

we recognized pension income of 91 million in 2017 compared to 69 million of pension income in 2016 and 01 million of pension expense in 2015 as of december 31 2015 we changed the method we used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic pension benefit cost for our pension plan and postretirement benefit plan historically we estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we elected to utilize an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows underlying the service cost and interest cost using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows this change was made to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates the change was the reason for 77 million and 71 million decreases in 2017 and 2016 respectively compared to 2015 in service and interest costs 

costs associated with our replacement retirement plan in 2017 were approximately 6 million consistent with 2016 we made changes to our pension plan including closing the plan to new entrants effective january 1 2010 and the sunset of our plan for the majority of our employees on december 31 2014 which significantly decreased pension expense beginning in 2015 lowering the expected return on plan assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2017 by approximately 20 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would decrease our 2017 net pension expense by approximately 03 million 

nongaap measures 

we provide nongaap measures adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share that exclude onetime expenses associated with us tax reform we believe that these nongaap measures better reflect our financial performance 

as such we believe that the measures of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share provide management and investors with a useful measure of our results we have prepared annual reconciliations of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share for 2017

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal foreign state local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2017 and we do not expect them to be material in any single year we have reserves and available insurance coverage associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2017 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding with notional values of 949 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in exchange rates would amount to 95 million however gains and losses from our forward contracts will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2017 we had 2829 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 23 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 06 million

 north america 

sales in our north america segment increased 24 percent or 402 million in 2016 compared with the prior year the sales increase in 2016 was the result of price increases in the us for residential and commercial water heaters and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and boilers in the us lower volumes of us residential water heaters partially offset these favorable factors our acquisition of aquasana inc aquasana a water treatment company in august 2016 added approximately 18 million of sales in 2016 compared with 2015

 item 1a  risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

 

 the global economy continues to show signs of stress and could stall or reverse the course of any recovery if this were to occur it could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition or slower adoption of energy efficient water heaters and boilers or high quality water filter products which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows in addition a deterioration in current economic conditions including credit market conditions could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials or increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 approximately 40 percent of our net sales in 2016 were attributable to products sold outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent in europe and india we also have operations and business relationships outside the us that comprise a portion of our manufacturing supply and distribution approximately 9700 of our 15500 employees as of december 31 2016 were located in china at december 31 2016 approximately 752 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries 558 million of which was located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions the imposition of tariffs or other trade restrictions or changes to trade agreements the impact of foreign government regulations actions or policies the effects of income taxes governmental expropriation the imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries labor relations problems the imposition of environmental or employment laws or other restrictions or actions by foreign governments and differences in business practices unfavorable changes in the political regulatory or trade climate diplomatic relations or government policies particularly in relation to countries where we have a presence including canada china and mexico could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the us 

 

 our sales growth in china has averaged approximately 18 percent per year in local currency over the past three years and we anticipate sales growth of approximately 15 percent in local currency in 2017 we are expanding our manufacturing capacity for water treatment and air purification products in china to meet local demand if there is a slowdown in the transition to a more consumer driven economy or the rate of urbanization was to stall it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 net sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 37 percent of our sales in 2016 we expect that our customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may shift their purchases to our competitors in the future the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers or our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the recovery in residential and commercial construction activity in north america remains fragile and construction could decline again after showing modest improvements in 2016 we believe that the majority of the markets we serve are for replacement of existing products and replacement related volume growth was strong in 2013 and 2014 before declining in 2015 and 2016 changes in replacement volume and in the construction market could negatively affect us 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing research and development and distribution resources than we have and some are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing or geographic footprints consumer purchasing behavior may shift to distribution channels including ecommerce which is a rapidly developing area development of a successful ecommerce strategy involves significant time investment and resources we cannot assure that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we have significant operations outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent europe and india and therefore hold assets incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in our consolidated financial statements as a result we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates or hyperinflation in some foreign countries furthermore typically our products are priced in foreign countries in local currencies as a result an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our foreign markets has had and would continue to have a negative effect on our profitability in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries’ functional currency the majority of our foreign currency transaction risk results from sales of our products in canada which are manufactured in the us these risks may hurt our reported sales and profits in the future or negatively impact revenues and earnings translated from foreign currencies into us dollars 

 

 our success may depend on our ability to adapt to technological changes in the water heating boiler and water treatment industries if we are unable to timely develop and introduce new products or enhance existing products in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or demands our competitiveness could be materially and adversely affected our ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop acquire and retain necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success but cannot reasonably be assured 

 

 our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements related to among other items energy efficiency environmental emissions labeling and safety while we believe our products are currently efficient safe and environmentfriendly a significant change to regulatory requirements whether federal foreign state or local or to industry standards could substantially increase manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 product defects can occur through our own product development design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities we may incur various expenses related to product defects including product warranty costs product liability and recall or retrofit costs while we maintain a reserve for product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve resulting in current period expenses and a need to increase our reserves for warranty charges in addition product defects and recalls may diminish the reputation of our brand further our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the market prices for certain raw materials we purchase primarily steel have been volatile significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in our ability to recover increased material costs from customers and that lag could negatively impact our profitability in addition in some cases we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components we require in the manufacture of our products a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a non–us government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture sale and use of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will be able to ultimately pay all insured losses in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 as of december 31 2016 approximately 752 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries we would incur a cost to repatriate these funds to the us and have recorded a liability of approximately 42 million associated with the repatriation of a portion of those funds additionally depending on tax proposals currently contemplated in the us we could incur onetime income tax expenses associated with repatriation and the remeasurement of deferred income taxes 

 

 attracting and retaining talented employees is important to the continued success of our business failure to retain key personnel particularly on the leadership team could have a material effect on our business and our ability to execute our business strategies in a timely and effective manner 

 

 the compound annual growth rate of sales of our lochinvarbranded products has been approximately eight percent per year since our acquisition of lochinvar in 2011 largely due to the transition in the boiler industry in the us from lower efficiency noncondensing boilers to higher efficiency higher priced condensing boilers as well as new product introductions in 2003 approximately five percent of the boilers sold in the us were condensing boilers and by 2015 the percentage had grown to approximately 43 percent our lochinvar brand is a leader in residential and commercial condensing boilers we expect the transition to condensing boilers to continue but if the transition to higher efficiency higher priced condensing boilers stalls as a result of lower energy costs a us recession occurs or our competitors’ technologies surpass our technology our growth rate could be lower than expected 

 

 in the ordinary course of business we utilize information systems for daytoday operations to collect and store sensitive data and information including our proprietary and regulated business information and personally identifiable information of our customers suppliers employees and business partners as well as personally identifiable information about our employees our information systems like those of other companies are susceptible to outages due to system failures failures on the part of thirdparty information system providers natural disasters power loss telecommunications failures viruses or breaches of security we continue to take steps to maintain and improve data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing and improving internal controls security technologies network and data center resiliency and recovery processes however any operations failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to disruptions of our business activities the loss or disclosure of both our and our customers’ financial product and other confidential information and could result in regulatory actions and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our reputation 

 

 while we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available capital to fund future acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions in new geographies our unfamiliarity with local regulations and market customs may impact our ability to operate them profitably or achieve our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing the impact of future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 due to the significant negative investment returns in 2008 flat returns in 2015 and falling interest rates in recent years the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately 109 million at december 31 2016 us employees hired after january 1 2010 have not participated in our defined benefit plan and benefit accruals for the majority of current salaried and hourly employees ended on december 31 2014 we are forecasting that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2017 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions however we cannot provide any assurance that contributions will not be required in the future among the key assumptions inherent in our actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to making the contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing the company 

 

 our total assets include significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase prices we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there have been impairments in the value of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at our businesses does not meet expectations we may be required to reflect noncash charges to operating results for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairments the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets may affect our ability to maintain the debttocapital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock currently are entitled as a class to elect only onethird of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit smith family have entered into a voting trust agreement with respect to shares of our class a common stock and shares of our common stock they own as of december 31 2016 these members of the smith family own approximately 620 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and common stock taken together as a single class and approximately 959 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock as a separate class due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and shares of our class a common stock the smith family is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control this ownership position may increase if other members of the smith family enter into the voting trust agreement and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our class a common stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our common stock the voting trust agreement provides that in the event one of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our class a common stock such shares of our class a common stock are automatically exchanged for shares of our common stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust in addition the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our class a common stock and our common stock proposed to be withdrawn or transferred from the trust as a result the smith family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the smith family decide to transfer their shares

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china europe and india both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas gas tankless and electric water heaters as well as water treatment products both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective regions of the world our north america segment also manufactures and globally markets specialty commercial water heating equipment condensing and noncondensing boilers and water systems tanks our rest of world segment also manufactures and markets inhome air purification products in china 

in 2016 our north america segment sales were 17432 million and our rest of world segment sales were 9656 million sales of our products in china grew significantly in 2016 increasing 125 percent over 2015 excluding the impact from the strengthening us dollar sales in china increased 189 percent in 2016 we expect sales in 2017 in china to grow at a rate of approximately 15 percent in local currency as we believe overall water heater market growth geographic expansion market share gains and growth in water treatment and air purification products will contribute to our growth price increases for residential and commercial water heaters and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and boilers contributed to 2016 sales increases in our north america segment partially offsetting these factors was a decline in residential water heater volumes in the us we expect our north america residential and commercial water heater industry unit to show modest growth in 2017 lochinvarbranded products contributed 3006 million to our net sales in 2016 and we expect over eight percent sales growth of lochinvarbranded products in 2017 driven by the continuing us industry transition to higher efficiency products and our introduction of new products approximately 40 percent of lochinvarbranded product sales consist of residential and commercial water heaters while the remaining 60 percent of lochinvarbranded product sales consist primarily of boilers and related parts 

our stated acquisition strategy includes a number of our waterrelated strategic initiatives we will look to continue to grow our core residential and commercial water heating boiler and water treatment businesses throughout the world we will also continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing operations in the high growth regions demonstrated by our introduction of air purification products in china and water treatment products in india and vietnam in 2015 

consistent with our stated strategy to expand our core product offering we acquired aquasana inc aquasana in august 2016 aquasana designs assembles and markets premium performance water treatment products including wholehouse treatment systems drinking water solutions for at home and onthego and shower filters aquasana sells products primarily directly to us consumers through ecommerce as well as through retail outlets and distributors with a three year compound annual revenue growth rate of 17 percent as of december 31 2016 aqausana fits squarely within our stated strategy to expand our core product offerings to new geographies that present growth opportunities

our sales in 2016 were a record 26859 million surpassing 2015 sales of 25365 million by 59 percent excluding the impact from the appreciation of the us dollar against the chinese currency that occurred in 2016 our sales grew approximately eight percent in 2016 the increase in sales in 2016 was primarily due to higher sales in china of water heaters residential air purification products as well as 35 percent sales growth of a o smithbranded water treatment products sales in china grew 125 percent in 2016 and excluding the impact of the appreciation of the us dollar sales in china increased 189 percent in 2016 our sales in 2016 also benefitted from price increases in the us higher volumes of us boilers and commercial water heaters as well as 184 million of sales of aquasanabranded water treatment products resulting from our acquisition of aquasana in august 2016 these items more than offset lower volumes of us residential water heaters our sales in 2015 were higher than 2014 sales of 23560 million by 77 percent the increase in sales in 2015 was attributable to higher prices in north america higher sales of lochinvarbranded products and commercial water heaters in the us as well as strong demand for our water heating and water treatment products in china sales of water heaters and water treatment products in china grew 137 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 sales of water heaters and water treatment products in china grew 161 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 excluding impact of the appreciation of the us dollar in 2015 

our gross profit margin in 2016 increased to 417 percent from 398 percent in 2015 the higher margin in 2016 was due to price increases in the us lower material costs in the first half of 2016 and higher sales of boilers and commercial water heaters in the us our gross profit margin in 2015 increased from 365 percent in 2014 primarily due to price increases in the us and canada higher us sales of commercial water heaters and boilers lower steel costs and a reduction in pensionrelated costs 

 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 482 million higher in 2016 than in 2015 the increase in sga expenses in 2016 to 6589 million was primarily due to higher selling costs supporting our sales efforts in tier 2 and tier 3 cities in china as well as higher advertising costs to support brand building in china sga expenses were 386 million higher in 2015 than in 2014 primarily due to higher selling and engineering costs supporting increased volumes in china as well as higher costs associated with the 2015 launch of air purification products in china which more than offset lower pension costs in the us 

pension income in 2016 was 69 million compared to pension expense of 01 million in 2015 and 286 million in 2014 as of december 31 2015 we changed to a more precise method to estimate the service cost and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for our pension and postretirement plan the change is the primary reason for the 71 million decrease in service and interest costs in 2016 compared to 2015 the significant decrease in pension expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to the sunset of our pension plan for the majority of our employees on december 31 2014 in 2015 we began making additional company contributions to a defined contribution plan in lieu of benefits earned in our pension plan 

interest expense was 73 million in 2016 compared to 74 million in 2015 and 57 million in 2014 the higher interest expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily related to interest rates on term notes in the amount of 75 million issued in january 2015 that were higher than the interest rate on the revolving credit facility that it replaced as well as higher overall debt levels related to share repurchases 

other income was 94 million in 2016 compared to 108 million in 2015 and 52 million in 2014 the decrease in other income in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in interest income caused by lower interest rates in china in 2016 the increase in other income in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher interest income resulting from a higher level of marketable securities during the year 

our effective tax rate was 294 percent in 2016 compared with 297 percent in 2015 and 275 percent in 2014 our lower effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to our adoption of a new accounting standard for sharebased compensation that was partially offset by a change in geographic earnings mix the higher effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a change in geographic earnings mix 

north america 

sales in our north america segment sales were 17432 million in 2016 or 402 million higher than sales of 17030 million in 2015 the sales increase in 2016 resulted from a full year of us price increases for residential water heaters related to a regulatory change in april 2015 and an august 2016 price increase in the us related to higher steel prices and other cost inflation sales in 2016 also benefitted from higher volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters in the us as well as the addition of 184 million of sales of water treatment products resulting from our aquasana acquisition lower volumes of us residential water heaters partially offset these benefits sales in 2015 were 813 million higher than sales of 16217 million in 2014 the sales increase in 2015 resulted from a price increase for residential water heaters in the us due to a regulatory change in april 2015 and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and condensing commercial boilers in the us partially offset by lower residential volumes in the us and a decrease in the translated value of the canadian dollar during 2015 

north america operating earnings were 3859 million in 2016 compared to operating earnings of 3399 million and 2387 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively operating margins were 221 percent 200 percent and 147 percent in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the higher operating earnings and operating margin in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily due to pricing actions in the us lower material costs in the first half of 2016 and higher boiler and commercial water heater volumes in the us that were partially offset by lower us residential water heater volumes the significantly higher operating earnings and operating margin in 2015 compared to 2014 were primarily due to higher prices in the us and canada higher sales of lochinvarbranded products and commercial water heaters in the us lower steel costs and lower pension costs which more than offset lower residential water heater volumes in the us we expect north america operating margin to be between 215 and 2225 percent in 2017 despite the headwind from lower aquasana margins of almost 50 basis points 

rest of world 

sales in our rest of world segment in 2016 were 9656 million or 995 million higher than sales of 8661 million in 2015 sales in china grew 125 percent in 2016 excluding the impact from the appreciation of the us dollar in 2016 sales in china increased 189 percent in 2016 driven by higher demand for water heaters water treatment products and residential air purification products a o smithbranded water treatment sales in china totaled 148 million in 2016 compared to 110 million in 2015 sales of inhome air purification products were 26 million in 2016 compared to 9 million in 2015 sales in 2015 were 978 million higher than sales of 7683 million in 2014 due to higher demand for water heaters approximately 35 million of incremental sales of water treatment products and approximately 9 million in sales of our newly launched inhome air purification products sales in china grew 137 percent in 2015 excluding the impact from the appreciation of the us dollar in 2015 sales in china increased 161 percent in 2015 

 

rest of world operating earnings were 1291 million in 2016 compared to operating earnings of 1130 million and 1067 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively segment operating margins were 134 percent in 2016 compared to 130 percent and 139 percent in 2015 and 2014 respectively higher operating earnings and operating margin in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily due to higher sales in china that were partially offset by increased sga expenses in china higher selling costs in china to support our sales efforts in tier 2 and tier 3 cities and higher advertising costs to support brand building were the primary drivers of higher sga expenses operating earnings in 2016 were also negatively impacted by almost 8 million due to the appreciation of the us dollar in 2016 higher operating earnings in 2015 were primarily due to higher sales in china and lower steel costs that were partially offset by lower sales of highly profitable commercial water heaters in china increased sga expenses and approximately 15 million of higher losses in india compared to 2014 earnings in china were reduced by approximately 25 million due to the appreciation of the us dollar in 2015 higher selling and engineering costs in china as well as higher sga costs associated with the 2015 launch of air purification products were the primary drivers for decreased operating margins in 2015 as compared to 2014 we expect 2017 operating margin to exceed 14 percent 

liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital was 7964 million at december 31 2016 compared with 7501 million and 7138 million at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively cash generated in china and salesrelated increases in accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable levels explain the majority of the increase in 2016 and 2015 as of december 31 2016 essentially all of our 7546 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries we would incur a cost to repatriate these funds to the us and have an accrual of 423 million for the repatriation of a portion of these funds 

cash provided by operating activities during 2016 was 4466 million compared with 3517 million during 2015 and 2640 million during 2014 the increase in cash flows in 2016 was primarily due to higher earnings from operations and lower outlays for working capital we experienced a series of favorable cash flow impacts in china in the fourth quarter of 2016 including 

 

  

  

 the improvement in cash flows in 2015 was primarily due to higher earnings from operations and lower outlays for working capital driven primarily by increases in accounts payable balances in china we expect cash provided by operating activities in 2017 to be approximately 350 million we expect higher earnings in 2017 to be more than offset by larger outlays for working capital due to the higher than anticipated cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2016 over the twoyear period from 2016 to 2017 we expect to generate operating cash of approximately 800 million which compares with 616 million of operating cash flows during 2014 to 2015 

our capital expenditures were 807 million in 2016 727 million in 2015 and 861 million in 2014 we broke ground in 2016 on the construction of a new water treatment and air purification products manufacturing facility in nanjing china to support the expected growth of these products in china included in 2016 capital expenditures were approximately 13 million related to capacity expansion in china as well as approximately 11 million related to our enterprise resource planning erp system implementation included in 2015 capital expenditures were approximately 16 million related to our erp implementation and approximately 19 million related to capacity expansion in china and the us to support growth included in 2014 capital expenditures was approximately 31 million related to our erp implementation we project between 90 and 100 million of capital expenditures in 2017 and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately 70 million we expect our spending on the manufacturing facility in nanjing will be approximately 40 million in 2017 

in december 2016 we completed a 500 million multicurrency five year revolving credit facility with a group of nine banks the facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to 700 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31 2016 the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings and it expires on december 15 2021 as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt 

 

in november 2016 we issued 45 million of fixed rate term notes in two tranches to two insurance companies principal payments commence in 2023 and 2028 and the notes mature in 2029 and 2034 respectively the notes carry interest rates of 287 and 310 respectively we used proceeds of the notes to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

in january 2015 we issued 75 million of fixed rate term notes to an insurance company principal payments commence in 2020 and the notes mature in 2030 the notes carry an interest rate of 352 percent we used proceeds of the notes to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

at december 31 2016 we had available borrowing capacity of 3108 million under this facility we believe that the combination of cash available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

our total debt increased to 3236 million at december 31 2016 compared with 2490 million at december 31 2015 as our cash flows generated in the us were more than offset by our share repurchase activity and our purchase of aquasana as a result our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 176 percent at the end of 2016 compared with 147 percent at the end of 2015 

our us pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations we were not required to make a contribution to our pension plan in 2016 but made a voluntary 30 million contribution due to escalating pension benefit guaranty corporation insurance premiums we forecast that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2017 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions in 2017 for further information on our pension plans see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during 2016 our board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional 3000000 shares of our common stock in 2016 we repurchased 3273109 shares at an average price of 4130 per share and a total cost of 1352 million a total of 4906403 shares remained on the existing repurchase authorization at december 31 2016 depending on factors such as stock price working capital requirements and alternative investment opportunities such as acquisitions we expect to spend approximately 135 million on share repurchase activity in 2017 using a 10b51 repurchase plan in addition we may opportunistically repurchase an additional 65 million of our shares in 2017 

we have paid dividends for 77 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 25 years we paid dividends of 048 per share in 2016 compared with 038 per share in 2015 in january 2017 we increased our dividend by 17 percent and anticipate paying dividends of 056 per share in 2017 

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016 is as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2016 our liability for uncertain income tax positions was 42 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to our scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments that we consider firm 

recent accounting pronouncements 

refer to recent accounting pronouncements in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we monitor these significant factors and adjustments are made as facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arm’slength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct annual thorough and competent valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment in goodwill or indefinitelived assets in 2016 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed at least annually at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates at december 31 2016 our reserve for product warranties was 1409 million 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year in 2016 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 75 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million 

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also utilize an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time at december 31 2016 our reserve for product liability was 386 million 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on plan assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our 

 

assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 750 percent in 2016 compared to 775 percent in 2015 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs increased to 440 percent in 2016 from 405 percent in 2015 for 2017 our expected return on plan assets is 750 percent and our discount rate is 415 percent 

in developing our expected return on plan assets we evaluate our pension plan’s current and target asset allocation the expected longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is approximately 45 to 55 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers private equity managers and real estate managers our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2016 was 48 percent to equity managers 37 percent to bond managers ten percent to real estate managers four percent to private equity managers and one percent to others we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical tenyear and 25year compounded annualized returns are 57 percent and 90 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the expected longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 750 percent expected return on plan assets for 2017 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2016 and 2015 were based on the aonhewitt aa only above median yield curve which was designed by aonhewitt to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the aa only above median yield curve represents a series of annual discount rates from bonds with aa minimum average rating as rated by moody’s investor service standard poor’s and fitch ratings we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

as of december 31 2015 we changed the method we used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic pension benefit cost for our pension plan and postretirement benefit plan the change was the primary reason for the 71 million decrease in the service and interest components of pension costs in 2016 

as a result we recognized pension income of 69 million in 2016 compared to 01 million of pension expense in 2015 costs associated with our replacement retirement plan in 2016 were approximately 6 million consistent with 2015 we made changes to our pension plan including closing the plan to new entrants effective january 1 2010 and the sunset of our plan for the majority of our employees on december 31 2014 which significantly decreased pension expense beginning in 2015 lowering the expected return on plan assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2017 by approximately 19 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would decrease our 2017 net pension expense by approximately 03 million 

outlook 

we expect our sales in china will continue to grow at a rate of approximately 15 percent in local currency terms in 2017 led by continued strong sales growth of water heaters water treatment and air purification products we project continued declines in the chinese currency compared to the us dollar resulting in a five percent or 40 million headwind in 2017 sales compared with the average rate in 2016 we expect our sales in the us to grow due to residential water heater industry growth driven by new construction and expansion of replacement demand as well as continued growth in sales of our boilers and water treatment products we expect sales of lochinvarbranded products to grow over eight percent we expect sales of aquasanabranded water treatment products will add an incremental 40 million of sales in 2017 we expect steel prices to continue to be volatile and to be significantly higher than our average cost in 2016 we expect our effective tax rate to be between 294 percent and 297 percent assuming the current us tax system remains in place 

combining all these factors we expect sales growth of between eight and 95 percent in 2017 and sales growth of between 95 and 11 percent measured in local currency in 2017 and earnings to be in the range of 198 to 208 per share for 2017 this does not include the potential impact of future acquisitions 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal foreign state local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2016 and we do not expect them to be material in any single year we have reserves associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2016 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 1022 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in exchange rates would amount to 102 million however gains and losses from our forward contracts will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2016 we had 1892 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 15 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 03 million

 item 1  business 

our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china europe and india both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas gas tankless and electric water heaters both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective regions of the world our north america segment also manufactures and globally markets specialty commercial water heating equipment condensing and noncondensing boilers and water systems tanks primarily for asia our rest of world segment also manufactures and markets water treatment products we also market inhome air purification products in china 

on august 22 2011 we sold our electrical products business epc to regal beloit corporation rbc for approximately 760 million in cash and approximately 283 million shares of rbc common stock valued at 1406 million as of that date due to the sale epc has been reflected as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial information for all periods presented 

the following table summarizes our sales from continuing operations this summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item 8 in this document 

 

 north america 

sales in our north america segment increased 50 percent or 813 million in 2015 compared with the prior year the sales increase in 2015 was the result of price increases in the us and canada for residential and commercial water heaters and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and condensing commercial boilers in the us lower volumes of us residential water heaters and lower water heater sales in canada primarily due to a decline in the value of the canadian dollar of approximately thirteen percent versus the us dollar partially offset these favorable factors our lochinvar brand which we acquired in august 2011 incrementally added approximately 143 million of sales in 2012 compared to 2011 approximately 40 percent of lochinvarbranded sales consist of residential and commercial water heaters while the remaining 60 percent of lochinvarbranded sales consist primarily of boilers and related parts 

we serve residential and commercial end markets in north america with a broad range of products including 

water heaters  our residential and commercial water heaters come in sizes ranging from 25 gallon pointofuse models to 12500 gallon products with varying efficiency ranges we offer electric natural gas gas tankless and liquid propane models as well as solar tank units our north american residential water heater sales in 2015 were approximately 11 billion or 62 percent of north america sales typical applications for our water heaters include residences restaurants hotels and motels office buildings laundries car washes and small businesses 

boilers our residential and commercial boilers range in size from 40000 british thermal units btus to 50 million btus our commercial boilers are used primarily in space heating applications for hospitals schools hotels and other large commercial buildings 

other our north america segment also manufactures expansion tanks commercial solar water heating systems swimming pool and spa heaters and related products and parts 

a significant portion of the sales in our north america segment is derived from the replacement of existing products 

we are the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in north america and we have a leading share in both the residential and commercial markets in the commercial market we believe our comprehensive product line including boilers 

 

and our highefficiency products give us a competitive advantage in this portion of the water heating industry our wholesale distribution channel includes more than 1200 independent wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 4400 selling locations serving residential and commercial end markets we also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel in this channel our customers include five of the seven largest national hardware and home center chains including longstanding exclusive relationships with both lowe’s and sears our boiler distribution channel is primarily comprised of manufacturer representative firms 

our lochinvar brand is one of the leading brands of residential and commercial boilers in the us 

our energy efficient product offerings continue to be a sales driver for our business our cyclone product family and our condensing boilers continue to be an option for commercial customers looking for high efficiency water and space heating with a short payback period through energy savings we offer residential heat pump condensing tanktype and tankless water heaters in north america as well as other higher efficiency water heating solutions to round out our energy efficient product offerings 

we sell our water heating products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price our principal water heating and boiler competitors in north america include rheem bradford white rinnai aerco and navien numerous other manufacturing companies also compete 

rest of world 

sales in our rest of world segment increased 127 percent or 978 million in 2015 compared with the prior year a 137 percent increase in sales in china to 7892 million was the primary source of the increase excluding the impact from the stronger us dollar china sales increased 161 percent in 2015 

we have operated in china for 20 years in that time we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building a o smith brand recognition in the chinese residential and commercial markets the chinese water heater market is predominantly comprised of electric wallhung solar and gas tankless water heaters we believe we are one of the leading suppliers of water heaters to the residential market in china with a broad product offering including electric gas gas tankless heat pump and solar units as well as combi boilers primarily for asia we also manufacture and market water treatment products we also market air purification products primarily for the residential market in china 

we sell water heaters in more than 8000 retail outlets in china of which over 2000 exclusively sell our products our water treatment products and air purification products are sold in over 5500 and 1200 retail outlets in china respectively our online sales continue to grow in china and in 2015 reached 140 million 

in 2008 we established a sales office in india and began importing products specifically designed for india from our china operations we began manufacturing water heaters in india in 2010 our sales in india were 159 million in 2015 compared with 151 million in 2014 

our primary competitor in china is haier appliances a chinese company but we also compete with midea in the electric water heater and water treatment markets and rinnai and noritz in the gas tankless and solar water heater markets additionally we compete with numerous other chinese private and stateowned water heater and water treatment companies in china in india we compete in the water heater and water treatment markets we compete with bajaj and mtsracold in the water heater market and eureka forbes and kent in the water treatment market 

in addition we sell water heaters in the european and middle eastern markets and water treatment products in turkey all of which combined comprised less than seven percent of total rest of world sales in 2015 

raw materials 

raw materials for our manufacturing operations primarily consisting of steel are generally available in adequate quantities a portion of our customers are contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in steel prices there has been volatility in steel costs over the last several years 

 

research and development 

to improve our competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin at our global engineering center in nanjing china and at our operating locations our total expenditures for research and development in 2015 2014 and 2013 were 737 million 679 million and 578 million respectively 

patents and trademarks 

we own and use in our businesses various trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and licenses we do not believe that our business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such trademark trade name patent trade secret or license however our trade name is important with respect to our products particularly in china india and the us 

employees 

we employed approximately 13400 employees as of december 31 2015 primarily nonunion 

backlog 

due to the shortcycle nature of our businesses none of our operations sustains significant backlogs

 item 1a – risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

 

 the global economy is still showing signs of stress and could stall or reverse the course of any recovery if this were to occur it could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition or slower adoption of energy efficient water heaters and boilers which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows in addition a deterioration in current economic conditions including credit market conditions could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials or increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our sales growth in china has averaged approximately 19 percent per year over the past three years and we anticipate sales growth of approximately 15 percent in local currency in 2016 we continue to expand capacity for water heating and water treatment products in china to meet local demand if a slowdown in the transition to a more consumer driven economy or the rate urbanization was to stall it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the compound annual growth rate of revenues of our lochinvarbranded products has been approximately ten percent per year since our acquisition of lochinvar largely due to the transition in the boiler industry in the us from lower efficiency noncondensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers as well as new product introductions in 2003 approximately five percent of the boilers sold in the us were condensing boilers and by 2013 the percentage had grown to approximately 40 percent our lochinvar brand is a leader in residential and commercial condensing boilers we expect the transition to continue which we believe would result in approximately ten percent sales growth in lochinvarbranded products in 2016 and annually for the foreseeable future after 2016 in conjunction with new product introductions if the transition to higher efficiency condensing boilers stalls as a result of lower energy costs another recession occurs or our competitors’ technologies surpass our technology our growth rate could be lower than expected 

 

 net sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 38 percent of our sales in 2015 we expect that our customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may shift their purchases to our competitors in the future the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or our inability to execute on pricing actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the recovery in residential and commercial construction activity in north america remains fragile and construction could decline again after showing improvements in 2015 we believe that the majority of the market we serve is for replacement of existing products and replacement related volume growth was strong in 2013 and 2014 before declining in 2015 changes in replacement volume and in the construction market could negatively affect us 

 

 we depend on information technology to record and process customers’ orders manufacture and ship products in a timely manner and maintain the financial accuracy of our business records we are in the midst of implementing a global enterprise resource planning system that is core to our efforts to redesign and deploy new processes and migrate to a common information system across our plants over a period of several years there is no certainty that this system will deliver the expected benefits implementation may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently which could increase costs and thereby impact profitability or otherwise impact our business in addition the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue and profit 

 

 approximately 40 percent of our net sales in 2015 were attributable to products sold outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent in europe and india approximately 8100 of our 13400 employees as of december 31 2015 were located in china at december 31 2015 approximately 458 million of our cash and marketable securities balances were located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade restrictions the impact of foreign government regulations the effects of income taxes governmental expropriation the imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries labor relations problems the imposition of environmental or employment laws or other restrictions by foreign governments and differences in business practices unfavorable changes in the political regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the us as of december 31 2015 approximately 645 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries we would incur a cost to repatriate these funds to the us and have recorded a liability of approximately 48 million associated with the repatriation of a portion of those funds 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing research and development and distribution resources than we have and some are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing or geographic footprints consumer purchasing behavior may shift to distribution channels including ecommerce which is a rapidly developing area development of a successful ecommerce strategy involves significant time investment and resources we cannot assure that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we have significant operations outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent europe and india and therefore hold assets incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in our consolidated financial statements as a result we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates or hyperinflation in some foreign countries furthermore typically our products are priced in foreign countries in local currencies as a result an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our foreign markets has had and would continue to have a negative effect on our profitability in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries’ functional currency the majority of our foreign currency transaction risk is a result of our canadian water heater operations these risks may hurt our reported sales and profits in the future or negatively impact revenues and earnings translated from foreign currencies into us dollars 

 

 our success may depend on our ability to adapt to technological changes in the water heating boiler and water treatment industries if we are unable to timely develop and introduce new products or enhance existing products in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or demands our competitiveness could be materially and adversely affected our ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop acquire and retain necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success but cannot reasonably be assured 

 

 our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements related to among other items energy efficiency environmental emissions labeling and safety while we believe our products are currently efficient safe and environmentfriendly a significant change to regulatory requirements whether federal foreign state or local or to industry standards could substantially increase manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 product defects can occur through our own product development design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities we may incur various expenses related to product defects including product warranty costs product liability and recall or retrofit costs while we maintain a reserve for product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve resulting in current period expenses and a need to increase our reserves for warranty charges in addition product defects and recalls may diminish the reputation of our brand further our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 acquisitions we have made have positively impacted our results of operations while we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and intend to use a significant portion of our available capital for future acquisitions we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms utilize cash flows from operations obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future if we complete any future acquisitions then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions in new geographies our unfamiliarity with local regulations and market customs may impact our ability to operate them profitably or achieve our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing the impact of future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the market prices for certain raw materials we purchase primarily steel have been volatile significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in our ability to recover increased material costs from customers and that lag could negatively impact our profitability in addition in some cases we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components we require in the manufacture of our products a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a nonus government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our water heating and boiler products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture sale and use of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will be able to ultimately pay all insured losses in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 attracting and retaining talented employees is important to the continued success of our business failure to retain key personnel particularly on the leadership team would have a material effect on our business and our ability to execute our business strategies in a timely and effective manner 

 

 in the ordinary course of business we collect and store sensitive data and information including our proprietary and regulated business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners as well as personally identifiable information about our employees our information systems like those of other companies are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters power loss telecommunications failures viruses breakins and similar events or breaches of security we continue to take steps to maintain and improve data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies internal controls network and data center resiliency and recovery processes however any operations failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of both our and our customers’ financial product and other confidential information and could result in regulatory actions and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation 

 

 due to the significant negative investment returns in 2008 flat returns in 2015 and falling interest rates in recent years the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately 134 million at december 31 2015 us employees hired after january 1 2010 have not participated in our defined benefit plan and benefit accruals for the majority of current salaried and hourly employees ended on december 31 2014 we are forecasting that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2016 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions however we cannot provide any assurance that contributions will not be required in the future among the key assumptions inherent in our actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to making the contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing the company 

 

 our total assets include significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase prices we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired 

 

we assess whether there has been impairments in the value of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at our businesses does not meet expectations we may be required to reflect noncash charges to operating results for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairments the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets may affect our ability to maintain the debttocapital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock currently are entitled as a class to elect only onethird of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit smith family have entered into a voting trust agreement with respect to shares of our class a common stock and shares of our common stock they own as of december 31 2015 these members of the smith family own approximately 610 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and common stock taken together as a single class and approximately 956 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock as a separate class due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and shares of our class a common stock the smith family is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control this ownership position may increase if other members of the smith family enter into the voting trust agreement and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our class a common stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our common stock the voting trust agreement provides that in the event one of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our class a common stock such shares of our class a common stock are automatically exchanged for shares of our common stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust in addition the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our class a common stock and our common stock proposed to be withdrawn or transferred from the trust as a result the smith family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the smith family decide to transfer their shares

in 2015 our north america segment sales were 17030 million and our rest of world segment sales were 8661 million sales of our products in china grew significantly in 2015 increasing 137 percent over 2014 excluding the impact from the strengthening us dollar sales in china increased 161 percent in 2015 we expect sales in 2016 in china to grow at a rate of approximately 15 percent in local currency as we believe overall water heater market growth geographic expansion market share gains growth in water treatment products and air purification products and improved product mix will contribute to our growth price increases for residential and commercial water heaters and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and condensing commercial boilers contributed to 2015 sales increases in our north america segment partially offsetting these factors was a decline in residential water heater volumes in the us the 13 percent decline in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar during 2015 also negatively impacted sales we expect north america residential and commercial water heater industry unit to show modest growth in 2016 lochinvarbranded products contributed 2960 million to our net sales in 2015 and we expect ten percent sales growth of lochinvarbranded products in 2016 driven by the us industry transition to higher efficiency products and our introduction of new products particularly condensing boilers approximately 40 percent of lochinvarbranded product sales consist of residential and commercial water heaters while the remaining 60 percent of lochinvarbranded product sales consist primarily of boilers and related parts 

our stated acquisition strategy includes a number of our waterrelated strategic initiatives we will look to continue to grow our core residential and commercial water heating boiler and water treatment businesses throughout the world we will also continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing operations in the high growth regions of china and india demonstrated by our introduction of air purification products in china in 2015 

consistent with our stated strategy to expand our core product offering we acquired lochinvar in 2011 lochinvar one of the leading manufacturers of residential and commercial boilers in the us fit squarely within our stated strategic growth initiative to expand our core water heating business in 2013 approximately 40 percent of boilers sold in the us were condensing boilers compared with five percent in 2003 our lochinvar brand is a leading brand of higher efficiency condensing boilers we expect the transition in the us to higher efficiency boilers will continue into the foreseeable future 

results of operations 

our sales in 2015 were a record 25365 million surpassing 2014 sales of 23560 million by 77 percent excluding the impact from the strengthening us dollar against the canadian and chinese currencies our sales grew over nine percent in 2015 the increase in sales was due to higher prices in north america higher sales of lochinvarbranded products and commercial water heaters in the us as well as continued demand for our water heating and water treatment products in china sales in china grew 137 percent in 2015 excluding the impact from the stronger us dollar china sales increased 161 percent in 2015 our sales in 2014 were higher than 2013 sales of 21538 million by 94 percent the increase in 2014 in sales was attributable to higher volumes of water heaters and boilers in the us and higher sales of water heaters and water treatment products in china sales of water heaters and water treatment products in china grew 184 percent to 6940 million in 2014 compared to 2013 

our gross profit margin in 2015 increased to 398 percent from 365 percent in 2014 the higher margin in 2015 was due to price increases in the us and canada higher us sales of commercial boilers and commercial water heaters which have higher margins lower steel costs and a reduction in pensionrelated costs our gross profit margin in 2014 increased slightly from 359 percent in 2013 primarily due to higher volumes of water heaters and boilers in the us partially offset by higher material costs in the us as well as higher volumes of water heaters and water treatment products in the china 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 386 million higher in 2015 than in 2014 the increase in sga expenses in 2015 to 6107 million was primarily due to higher selling and engineering costs in support of increased volumes in china as well as higher costs associated with the 2015 launch of air purification products in china which more than offset 

 

lower pension costs in the us sga expenses were 476 million higher in 2014 than in 2013 primarily due to higher selling and advertising costs in support of increased volumes in north america and china and approximately 9 million of incremental enterprise resource planning system erp implementation costs 

on march 28 2013 our board of directors approved a plan to transfer residential water heater production from our fergus ontario plant to our other north american facilities the majority of our production was consolidated in the second quarter of 2013 as a result of the capacity rationalization we incurred pretax restructuring and impairment expenses of 220 million in 2013 related to employee severance costs impairments of assets and equipment relocation costs in addition included in operating earnings in 2013 is a pretax gain of 110 million resulting from a settlement with a former supplier related to previous overcharges and warranty costs 

pension expense in 2015 was 01 million compared to 286 million in 2014 and 279 million in 2013 the significant decrease in pension expense in 2015 compared to prior years was due to the sunset of our pension plan for the majority of our employees on december 31 2014 in 2015 we began making additional company contributions to a defined contribution plan in lieu of benefits earned in our pension plan 

interest expense was 74 million in 2015 compared to 57 million in 2014 interest expense in 2013 was also 57 million the higher interest expense in 2015 was primarily related to interest rates on term notes in the amount of 75 million issued in january 2015 that were higher than the interest rate on the revolving credit facility that it replaced as well as higher overall debt levels related to share repurchases 

other income was 108 million in 2015 compared to 52 million in 2014 and 38 million in 2013 the increases in other income in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to higher interest income compared to the preceding year 

our effective tax rate was 297 percent in 2015 compared with 275 percent in 2014 and 282 percent in 2013 the higher effective tax rate in 2015 was primarily due to a change in geographic earnings mix as compared to the prior year 

north america 

our north america segment sales were 17030 million in 2015 or 813 million higher than sales of 16217 million in 2014 the sales increase in 2015 resulted from higher prices in the us and canada and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and condensing commercial boilers in the us partially offset by lower residential volumes in the us and an unfavorable currency impact in canada sales in 2014 were 1017 million higher than sales of 15200 million in 2013 the sales increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher volumes of water heaters and boilers in the us which were partially offset by lower water heaters sales in canada primarily due to a decline in the value of the canadian dollar of approximately seven percent versus the us dollar 

north america operating earnings were 3399 million in 2015 compared to operating earnings of 2387 million and 2119 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively operating margins were 200 percent 147 percent and 139 percent in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the significantly higher operating earnings and operating margin in 2015 were primarily due to higher prices in the us and canada higher sales of lochinvarbranded products and commercial water heaters in the us lower steel costs and lower pension costs which more than offset lower residential water heater volumes in the us higher operating earnings in 2014 compared to 2013 were primarily due to higher volumes in the us which were partially offset by higher material costs and approximately 9 million of incremental erp implementation costs 

rest of world 

sales in our rest of world segment in 2015 were 8661 million or 978 million higher than sales of 7683 million in 2014 sales in china increased approximately 95 million due to higher demand for water heaters approximately 35 million of incremental sales of water treatment products and approximately 9 million in sales of our newly launched inhome air purification products sales in china grew 137 percent in 2015 excluding the impact from the stronger us dollar china sales increased 161 percent in 2015 sales for our rest of world segment in 2014 were 1003 million higher than sales of 6680 million in 2013 due to an 184 percent increase in sales in china driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products and a higher priced product mix that was partially offset by lower sales in india resulting from weakness in the housing market and the termination of a cobranding relationship with our largest distributor 

rest of world operating earnings were 1130 million in 2015 compared to operating earnings of 1067 million and 880 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively segment operating margins were 130 percent in 2015 as compared to 139 percent and 132 percent in 2014 and 2013 respectively higher operating earnings in 2015 were primarily due to higher sales in china and lower steel costs that were partially offset by lower sales of highly profitable commercial water heaters in china increased sga expenses and approximately 15 million of higher losses in india as compared to 2014 china earnings were reduced by approximately 25 million due to currency translation higher selling and engineering costs in china as well as higher 

 

sga costs associated with the 2015 launch of air purification products were the primary drivers for the decreased operating margin in 2015 as compared to 2014 higher operating earnings and margins in 2014 as compared to 2013 were due to higher sales of water heaters and water treatment products in china as well as a higher priced product mix as a result of product introductions with higher value features which was partially offset by larger losses in india losses in india were 75 million in 2014 including approximately 1 million of product development and advertising expenses in advance of our 2015 launch of water treatment products 

liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital was 8021 million at december 31 2015 compared with 7138 million and 6147 million at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively cash generated in china and salesrelated increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels explain the majority of the increase in both 2015 and 2014 as of december 31 2015 essentially all of the 6452 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries we would incur a cost to repatriate these funds to the us and have an accrual of 479 million for the repatriation of a portion of these funds 

cash provided by operating activities during 2015 was 3444 million compared with 2639 million during 2014 and 2796 million during 2013 the improvement in cash flows in 2015 was primarily due to higher earnings from operations and lower outlays for working capital driven primarily by increases in accounts payable balances in china higher earnings in 2014 were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital we expect cash provided by operating activities in 2016 to be approximately 320 million 

our capital expenditures were 727 million in 2015 861 million in 2014 and 977 million in 2013 included in 2015 capital expenditures were approximately 16 million related to our erp implementation and approximately 19 million related to capacity expansion in china and the us to support growth included in 2014 capital expenditures was approximately 31 million related to our erp implementation included in 2013 capital expenditures was approximately 45 million in china and india for the construction of a second water heater manufacturing plant in nanjing china and to continue the expansion of our manufacturing plant near bangalore india also included in 2013 capital expenditures was approximately 19 million related to the erp implementation we project 2016 capital expenditures will be between 120 and 130 million and depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 will be approximately 70 million we expect capital spending in 2016 to include approximately 8 million related to our erp implementation and approximately 40 million related to the initial phase of a new water treatment manufacturing facility in china as we will outgrow capacity in a leased facility in the next few years 

in december 2012 we completed a 400 million multicurrency five year revolving credit facility with a group of eight banks the facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to 500 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31 2015 the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings and it expires on december 12 2017 as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt 

at december 31 2015 we had available borrowing capacity of 2530 million under this facility we believe that the combination of cash available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

in january 2015 we issued 75 million of fixed rate term notes to an insurance company principal payments commence in 2020 and the notes mature in 2030 the notes have an interest rate of 352 percent we used proceeds of the notes to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

our total debt increased to 2490 million at december 31 2015 compared with 2238 million at december 31 2014 as our cash flows generated in the us were more than offset by our share repurchase activity as a result our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 147 percent at the end of 2015 compared with 139 percent at the end of 2014 

our us pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations we were not required to make a contribution to our pension plan in 2015 and we did not make any voluntary contributions we forecast that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2016 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions in 2016 for further information on our pension plans see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during 2015 our board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional 2000000 shares of our common stock in 2015 we repurchased 1908237 shares at an average price of 6714 per share and a total cost of 1281 million at december 31 

 

2015 a total of 2589756 shares remained on the existing repurchase authorization depending on factors such as stock price working capital requirements and alternative investment opportunities we expect to spend approximately 150 million on stock repurchase activity in 2016 

we have paid dividends for 76 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 24 years we paid total dividends of 076 per share in 2015 compared with 060 per share in 2014 in january 2016 we increased our dividend by 26 percent and anticipate paying total dividends of 096 per share in 2016 

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015 is as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2015 our liability for uncertain income tax positions was 26 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to our scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments that we consider firm 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in november 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended accounting standard codification asc 740 income taxes issued under accounting standards no asn 201517 this amendment requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position the amendment is effective for periods beginning january 1 2016 and allows for either prospective adoption or retrospective adoption we expect the adoption of amended asc 740 to impact the classification of deferred taxes on our consolidated balance sheet 

in april 2015 the fasb amended asc 83530 interest  imputation of interest issued under asn 201503 this amendment to asc 83530 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected by this amendment the amendment is effective for periods beginning january 1 2016 and requires using a retrospective approach we do not expect the adoption of amended asc 83530 to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asc 60610 revenue from contracts with customers issued under asn 201409 asc 60610 will replace all existing revenue recognition guidance when effective in july 2015 the fasb approved a one year deferral of the effective date with application permitted as of the original effective date or periods beginning january 1 2017 either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption is allowed under asc 60610 we are in the process of determining whether the adoption of asc 60610 will have an impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we monitor these significant factors and adjustments are made as facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arm’slength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct annual thorough and competent valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment in goodwill or indefinitelived assets in 2015 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed on a periodic basis at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year in 2015 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 75 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million per occurrence 

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also use an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time at december 31 2015 our reserve for product liability was 387 million 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on plan assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 775 percent in 2015 and 2014 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs decreased to 405 percent in 2015 from 485 percent in 2014 for 2016 our expected return on plan assets is 750 percent and our discount rate is 440 percent 

in developing our expected return on plan assets we evaluate our pension plan’s current and target asset allocation the expected longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is approximately 50 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers and real estate managers our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2015 

 

was 47 percent to equity managers 39 percent to bond managers nine percent to real estate managers and five percent to private equity managers we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical tenyear and 25year compounded annualized returns are 61 percent and 95 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the expected longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 750 percent expected return on plan assets for 2016 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2015 and 2014 were based on the aonhewitt aa only above median yield curve which was designed by aonhewitt to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the aa only above median yield curve represents a series of annual discount rates from bonds with aa minimum average rating as rated by moody’s investor service standard poor’s and fitch ratings we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

as of december 31 2015 we changed the method we used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic pension benefit cost for our pension plan and postretirement benefit plan the change will result in an approximate 7 million decrease in the service and interest components in 2016 

as a result we estimate that we will recognize pension income of approximately 7 million in 2016 compared to 01 million of pension expense in 2015 we estimate that costs associated with our replacement retirement plan in 2016 will be approximately 6 million consistent with 2015 we made changes to our pension plan including closing the plan to new entrants effective january 1 2010 and the sunset of our plan for the majority of our employees on december 31 2014 which significantly decreased pension expense beginning in 2015 lowering the expected return on plan assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2015 by approximately 18 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would decrease our 2015 net pension expense by approximately 03 million 

outlook 

despite volatile conditions in china we continue to expect strong profitable sales growth in china in 2016 at the rate of approximately 15 percent in local currency terms we continue to experience strong consumer demand for our water heating and water treatment products in china and our new air purification products have been well received by chinese consumers in the us we expect the transition from noncondensing lower efficiency boilers to condensing higher efficiency boilers to continue in 2016 which combined with new products should allow sales growth of lochinvarbranded products to continue at ten percent we expect modest growth in commercial and residential water heater volumes in north america driven by modest assumptions for new construction and steady replacement demand other income is expected to be approximately 5 million lower in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to expected lower interest rates than last year on cash deposits in china we anticipate erp implementation related costs will be approximately 9 million higher or approximately 25 million in 2016 due to the increase in the number of scheduled golive events in 2016 we also expect our effective tax rate to be between 305 percent and 31 percent due to a change in geographic earnings mix 

combining all these factors we expect sales growth of between nine and ten percent in local currency terms and between seven and eight percent in us dollars in 2016 and earnings to be in the range of 340 to 355 per share for 2016 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal foreign state local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2015 and we do not expect them to be material in any single year we have reserves associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2015 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 798 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 80 million gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2015 we had 1470 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 13 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 02 million

 item 1  business 

our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china europe and india both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential gas gas tankless and electric water heaters both segments primarily serve their respective regions of the world our north america segment also manufactures and markets specialty commercial water heating equipment condensing and noncondensing boilers and water systems tanks our rest of world segment also manufactures and markets water treatment products primarily for asia 

on august 22 2011 we sold our electrical products business epc to regal beloit corporation rbc for approximately 760 million in cash and approximately 283 million shares of rbc common stock valued at 1406 million as of that date due to the sale epc has been reflected as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented for further information about epc see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table summarizes our sales from continuing operations this summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item 8 in this document 

 

 north america 

sales in our north america segment increased 67 percent or 1017 million in 2014 compared with the prior year the sales increase in 2014 benefitted from higher volumes of water heaters and boilers in the us which were partially offset by lower water heater sales in canada primarily due to a decline in the value of the canadian dollar of approximately seven percent versus the us dollar our lochinvar brand which we acquired in august 2011 incrementally added approximately 143 million of sales in 2012 compared to 2011 approximately 40 percent of lochinvarbranded sales consist of residential and commercial water heaters while the remaining 60 percent of lochinvarbranded sales consist primarily of boilers and related parts 

we serve residential and commercial end markets in north america with a broad range of products including 

water heaters  our residential and commercial water heaters come in sizes ranging from 25 gallon pointofuse models to 12500 gallon products with varying efficiency ranges we offer electric natural gas gas tankless and liquid propane models as well as solar tank units our north american residential water heater sales in 2014 were approximately 1 billion or 62 percent of north america sales typical applications for our water heaters include residences restaurants hotels and motels laundries car washes and small businesses 

boilers our residential and commercial boilers range in size from 40000 british thermal units btus to 50 million btus our commercial boilers are used primarily in space heating applications for hospitals schools hotels and other large commercial buildings 

other our north america segment also manufactures expansion tanks commercial solar water heating systems swimming pool and spa heaters and related products and parts 

a significant portion of the sales in our north america segment is derived from the replacement of existing products 

we are the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in north america and we have a leading share in both the residential and commercial markets in the commercial market we believe our comprehensive product line including boilers and our highefficiency products give us a competitive advantage in this portion of the water heating industry our wholesale distribution channel includes more than 1200 independent wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 4400 selling 

 

locations serving residential and commercial end markets we also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel in this channel our customers include five of the seven largest national hardware and home center chains including longstanding exclusive relationships with both lowe’s and sears our boiler distribution channel is primarily comprised of manufacturer representative firms 

we acquired lochinvar in 2011 for approximately 435 million including an earnout provision that resulted in a payment of 135 million in december 2012 our lochinvar brand is one of the leading brands of residential and commercial boilers in the united states us 

our energy efficient product offerings continue to be a sales driver of our business our cyclone product family and our condensing boilers continue to be an option for commercial customers looking for high efficiency water and space heating with a short payback period through energy savings we offer residential heat pump condensing tanktype and tankless water heaters in north america as well as other higher efficiency water heating solutions to round out our energy efficient product offerings 

we sell our water heating products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design quality of products and services performance and price our principal water heating and boiler competitors in north america include rheem bradford white rinnai and aerco numerous other manufacturing companies also compete 

rest of world 

sales in our rest of world segment increased 150 percent or 1003 million in 2014 compared with the prior year an 184 percent increase in sales in china to 6940 million was the primary source of the increase 

we have operated in china for almost 20 years in that time we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building a o smith brand recognition in the chinese residential and commercial markets the chinese water heater market is predominantly comprised of electric wallhung solar and gas tankless water heaters we believe we are one of the leading suppliers of water heaters to the residential market in china with a broad product offering including electric gas gas tankless heat pump and solar units as well as combi boilers we also manufacture and market water treatment products primarily for the residential market 

we sell water heaters in more than 7000 retail outlets in china of which over 1600 exclusively sell our products in addition our water treatment products are sold in 4500 retail outlets in china online sales continue to grow in china and in 2014 exceeded 50 million 

in 2008 we established a sales office in india and began importing products specifically designed for india from our china operations we began manufacturing water heaters in india in 2010 our sales in india were 151 million in 2014 lower than in 2013 resulting from the weakness in the housing market and the termination of a cobranding relationship with our largest distributor 

our primary competitor in china is haier appliances a chinese company but we also compete with midea in the electric water heater market and rinnai and noritz in the gas tankless and solar water heater markets additionally we compete with numerous other chinese private and stateowned water heater and water treatment companies in china in india we compete with bajaj mtsracold venus haier havells and numerous other companies 

in addition we sell water heaters to the european and middle eastern markets and water treatment products in turkey all of which comprised approximately seven percent of total rest of world sales in 2014 

raw materials 

raw materials for our manufacturing operations primarily consisting of steel are generally available in adequate quantities a portion of our customers are contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in steel prices there has been volatility in steel costs over the last several years 

research and development 

to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin at our global engineering center in nanjing china and at our operating locations total expenditures for research and development in 2014 2013 and 2012 were 679 million 578 million and 517 million respectively 

 

patents and trademarks 

we own and use in our businesses various trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and licenses we do not believe that our business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such trademark trade name patent trade secret or license however our trade name is important with respect to our products particularly in china india and the us 

employees 

our operations employed approximately 12400 employees as of december 31 2014 primarily nonunion 

backlog 

due to the shortcycle nature of our businesses none of our operations sustain significant backlogs 

environmental laws 

our operations are governed by a variety of federal foreign state and local laws intended to protect the environment compliance with environmental laws has not had and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of our company see item 3

 item 1a  risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

 

 the global economy is still showing signs of stress and could stall or reverse the course of any recovery if this were to occur it could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition or slower adoption of energy efficient water heaters and boilers which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows in addition a deterioration in current economic conditions including credit market conditions could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials or increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our sales growth in china has averaged approximately 20 percent per year over the past three years and we anticipate sales growth of approximately two times the rate of china’s gross domestic product growth in 2015 we continue to expand capacity in china to meet local demand if the growth rate of the chinese economy were to experience a significant slowdown or urbanization was to stall it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 net sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 35 percent of our sales in 2014 we expect that our customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our dependence on sales to a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may shift their purchases of products to our competitors in the future the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or our inability to execute on pricing actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

 naeca iii increases the energy efficiency standards for us residential water heaters and impacts approximately 80 percent of our us residential products residential water heaters manufactured after april 15 2015 must meet the new standards however our customers may continue to sell noncompliant water heaters after the naeca iii effective date as a result of the breadth of this new standard the changeover to the new compliant products extensively impacts our engineering manufacturing logistics operations and procurement activities the new compliant products are more expensive to manufacture and we have announced a price increase to our customers we may experience operating inefficiencies and onetime costs as a result of the changeover to naeca iii compliant products that could materially impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition we may not be able to recover all of our costs incurred in ensuring that our products are compliant with the naeca iii regulation due to uncertainty over pricing actions 

 

 the compound annual growth rate of lochinvarbranded revenues has been over ten percent per year since our acquisition of lochinvar largely due to the transition in the boiler industry in the us from lower efficiency noncondensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers as well as new product introductions in 2003 approximately five percent of the boilers sold in the us were condensing boilers and by 2013 the percentage had grown to approximately 40 percent and our lochinvar brand is a leader in residential and commercial condensing boilers we expect the transition to continue which we 

 

believe would result in approximately ten percent growth in lochinvarbranded sales in 2015 and annually for the foreseeable future after 2015 in conjunction with new product introductions if the transition to higher efficiency condensing boilers stalls as a result of lower energy costs another recession occurs or our competitors’ technologies surpass our technology our growth rate could be lower than expected 

 

 the recovery in residential and commercial construction activity in north america remains fragile and construction could decline again after showing improvements in 2014 we believe that the majority of the business we serve is for replacement of existing products and replacement related volume growth was strong in 2013 and 2014 changes in replacement volume and in the construction market could negatively affect us 

 

 we depend on information technology to record and process customers’ orders manufacture and ship products in a timely manner and maintain the financial accuracy of our business records we are in the process of implementing a global enterprise resource planning system that is core to our efforts to redesign and deploy new processes and migrate to a common information system across our plants over a period of several years there is no certainty that this system will deliver the expected benefits implementation may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently which could increase costs and thereby impact profitability or otherwise impact our business in addition the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue and profit 

 

 approximately 38 percent of our net sales in 2014 were attributable to products sold outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent in europe and india approximately 7100 of our 12400 total employees as of december 31 2014 were located in china at december 31 2014 approximately 355 million of our cash and marketable securities balances were located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade restrictions the impact of foreign government regulations the effects of income taxes governmental expropriation the imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries labor relations problems the imposition of environmental or employment laws or other restrictions by foreign governments and differences in business practices unfavorable changes in the political regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the us as of december 31 2014 approximately 542 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries we would incur a cost to repatriate these funds to the us 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing research and development and distribution resources than we have we cannot assure that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our success may depend on our ability to adapt to technological changes in the water heating boiler and water treatment industries if we are unable to timely develop and introduce new products or enhance existing products in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or demands our competitiveness could be materially and adversely affected our ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop acquire and retain necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success but cannot reasonably be assured 

 

 acquisitions we have made have positively impacted our results of operations while we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and intend to use a significant portion of our available capital for future acquisitions we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms utilize cash flows from operations obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future if we complete any future acquisitions then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions in new geographies our unfamiliarity with local regulations and market customs may impact our ability to operate them profitably or achieve our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing the impact of future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we have significant operations outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent europe and india and therefore hold assets incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in our consolidated financial statements as a result we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates or hyperinflation in some foreign countries furthermore typically our products are priced in foreign countries in local currencies as a result an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our foreign markets could have a negative effect on our profitability in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries’ functional currency these risks may hurt our reported sales and profits in the future or negatively impact revenues and earnings translated from foreign currencies into us dollars 

 

 our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements related to among other items energy efficiency environmental emissions labeling and safety while we believe our products are currently efficient safe and environmentfriendly a significant change to regulatory requirements whether federal foreign state or local or otherwise to industry standards could substantially increase manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 product defects can occur through our own product development design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities we may incur various expenses related to product defects including product warranty costs product liability and recall or retrofit costs while we maintain a reserve for product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve resulting in current period expenses and a need to increase our reserves for warranty charges in addition product defects and recalls may diminish the reputation of our brand further our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 attracting and retaining talented employees is important to the continued success of our business failure to retain key personnel particularly on the leadership team would have a material effect on our business and our ability to execute our business strategies in a timely and effective manner 

 

 the market prices for certain raw materials we purchase primarily steel have been volatile significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in our ability to recover increased material costs from customers and that lag could negatively impact our profitability in addition in some cases we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components we require in the manufacture of our products a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a nonus government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our water heating and boiler products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture sale and use of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will be able to ultimately pay all insured losses in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 due to the significant negative investment returns in 2008 and falling interest rates in recent years the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately 133 million at december 31 2014 us employees hired after january 1 2010 have not participated in our defined benefit plan and benefit accruals for the majority of current salaried and hourly employees ended on december 31 2014 we are forecasting that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2015 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions however we cannot provide any assurance that contributions will not be required in the future among the key assumptions inherent in our actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to making the contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing the company 

 

 our total assets include significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase prices we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there has been impairments in the value of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at our businesses 

 

does not meet expectations we may be required to reflect noncash charges to operating results for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairments the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets may affect our ability to maintain the debttocapital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies – goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 in the ordinary course of business we collect and store sensitive data and information including our proprietary and regulated business information and that of our customers suppliers and business partners as well as personally identifiable information about our employees our information systems like those of other companies are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters power loss telecommunications failures viruses breakins and similar events or breaches of security we continue to take steps to maintain and improve data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies internal controls network and data center resiliency and recovery processes however any operations failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of both our and our customers’ financial product and other confidential information and could result in regulatory actions and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation 

 

 we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock currently are entitled as a class to elect only onethird of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit smith family have entered into a voting trust agreement with respect to shares of our class a common stock and shares of our common stock they own as of december 31 2014 these members of the smith family own approximately 610 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and common stock taken together as a single class and approximately 956 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock as a separate class due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and shares of our class a common stock the smith family is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control this ownership position may increase if other members of the smith family enter into the voting trust agreement and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our class a common stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our common stock the voting trust agreement provides that in the event one of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our class a common stock such shares of our class a common stock are automatically exchanged for shares of our common stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust in addition the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our class a common stock and our common stock proposed to be withdrawn or transferred from the trust as a result the smith family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the smith family decide to transfer their shares

sales of our products in china grew significantly in 2014 we expect sales in 2015 in china to grow at the rate of approximately two times the rate of china’s gross domestic product gdp growth as we believe overall water heater market growth geographic expansion market share gains growth in water treatment and improved product mix will contribute to our growth the residential replacement market contributed significantly to 2014 sales in our north america segment our 2014 north america residential unit sales grew midsingle digits compared to the prior year and commercial sales showed similar unit growth we expect both north america residential and commercial water heater industry unit growth to be flat or show modest growth in 2015 due to growth the industry experienced in 2014 in excess of the growth rate of the us gdp and the 2014 fourth quarter prebuy we believe occurred in advance of a regulatory change requiring increased energy efficiency from residential water heaters lochinvarbranded products contributed 275 million to our net sales in 2014 and we expect ten percent sales growth of lochinvarbranded products in 2015 driven by sales of higher efficiency products and the introduction of new products particularly condensing boilers approximately 40 percent of lochinvarbranded sales consist of residential and commercial water heaters while the remaining 60 percent of lochinvarbranded sales consist primarily of boilers and related parts 

our stated acquisition strategy includes a number of our waterrelated strategic initiatives we will look to continue to grow our core residential and commercial water heating boiler and water treatment businesses throughout the world we will also continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing operations in the high growth regions of china and india 

consistent with our stated strategy to expand our core product offering we acquired lochinvar in 2011 lochinvar one of the leading manufacturers of residential and commercial boilers in the us fit squarely within our stated strategic growth initiative to expand our core water heating business in 2013 approximately 40 percent of boilers sold in the us were condensing boilers compared with five percent ten years ago our lochinvar brand is a leading brand of higher efficiency condensing boilers we expect the transition in the us to higher efficiency boilers will continue into the foreseeable future 

results of operations 

our sales in 2014 were a record 23560 million surpassing 2013 sales of 21538 million by 94 percent the increase in sales was due to higher volumes of water heaters and boilers in the us as well as an 184 percent increase in sales to 6940 million of water heaters and water treatment products in china our sales in 2013 were higher than 2012 sales of 19393 million by 111 percent the 2013 increase in sales was attributable to higher sales in china and higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters and boilers in the us sales of water heaters and water treatment products in china grew 253 percent to 5863 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 

our gross profit margin in 2014 increased to 365 percent from 359 percent in 2013 the impact of increased sales volumes of water heaters and boilers in the us partially offset by higher material costs in the us as well as higher volumes of water heaters and water treatment products in china contributed to higher gross profit margins in 2014 our gross profit margin in 2013 increased 23 percent from 336 percent in 2012 the higher gross profit margin in 2013 was primarily due to the contribution from increased sales volumes of water heaters and boilers in the us lower material costs in the us and higher sales of water heaters and water treatment products in china as well as higher priced product mix as a result of product introductions with higher value features in china 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 476 million higher in 2014 than in 2013 the increase in sga expenses in 2014 to 5721 million was primarily due to higher selling and advertising costs in support of increased volumes in north america and china and approximately 9 million of incremental planned enterprise resource planning system erp implementation costs sga expenses were 740 million higher in 2013 than in 2012 primarily due to higher selling and advertising expenses in support of increased volumes in north america and china and higher pension expenses in north america 

 

on march 28 2013 our board of directors approved a plan to transfer residential water heater production from our fergus ontario plant to our other north american facilities the majority of our production was consolidated in the second quarter of 2013 as a result of the capacity rationalization we incurred pretax restructuring and impairment expenses of 220 million in 2013 related to employee severance costs impairments of assets and equipment relocation costs these activities are reflected in the “restructuring impairment and settlement expenses income net” line in the accompanying financial statements 

in addition included in operating earnings in 2013 is a pretax gain of 110 million resulting from a settlement with a former supplier related to previous overcharges and warranty costs operating earnings in 2012 included a pretax gain of 39 million associated with a legal settlement with a component supplier for our canadian operations these gains are also reflected in the “restructuring impairment and settlement expenses income net” line in the accompanying financial statements 

also included in 2012 operating earnings is a 33 million favorable adjustment related to the finalization of an earnout obligation from our acquisition of lochinvar the earnout adjustment is reflected as “contingent consideration adjustment” in the accompanying financial statements 

pension expense in 2014 was 286 million compared to 279 million in 2013 and 138 million in 2012 the increases in pension expense in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to increases in the amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses in these years in addition to decreases in the expected rate of return on plan assets 

interest expense was 57 million in 2014 unchanged from 2013 interest expense in 2012 was 92 million the higher interest expense in 2012 was due to higher debt levels as a result of the lochinvar acquisition in 2011 in addition in 2011 we sold epc to rbc and received 283 million shares of rbc common stock during 2012 we sold all of our shares of rbc common stock the net proceeds of which were used to pay down debt in 2012 

other income was 52 million in 2014 compared to 38 million in 2013 the increase in other income in 2014 is primarily due to higher interest income other income of 343 million in 2012 was primarily comprised of 272 million of pretax gains on the sale of the shares of rbc common stock received in the sale of epc net of the impact of the rbc share collar described below with most of the remainder of 2012 net other income resulting from interest income on investments resulting from the sale of epc we received the rbc common stock in august 2011 under an agreement that we executed in december 2010 the rbc share price appreciated in 2011 during which we entered into an equity collar contract for 50 percent of the shares that we expected to receive to protect a portion of the appreciation the collar did not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore was adjusted to fair value through earnings from continuing operations 

our effective tax rate was 275 percent in 2014 compared with 282 percent in 2013 and 304 percent in 2012 the rate decline from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to increased profits in jurisdictions with lower enacted income tax rates than the us principally china 

our 2012 net earnings include discontinued operations aftertax losses of 39 million or 04 per diluted share related to the sale of epc which occurred in 2011 included in discontinued operations in 2012 was 64 million of expense representing the correction of an error primarily due to our calculation of taxes due upon repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings 

north america 

our north america segment sales were 16217 million in 2014 or 1017 million higher than sales of 15200 million in 2013 the sales increase in 2014 benefitted from higher volumes of water heaters and boilers in the us which were partially offset by lower water heater sales in canada primarily due to a decline in the value of the canadian dollar of approximately seven percent versus the us dollar sales in 2013 were 892 million higher than sales of 14308 million in 2012 the sales increase in 2013 was primarily due to higher sales of residential and commercial water heaters and boilers in the us 

north america operating earnings were 2387 million in 2014 as compared to operating earnings of 2119 million and 1998 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively adjusted segment operating earnings were 2534 million in 2014 as compared to adjusted segment operating earnings of 2377 million and 1970 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively higher operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings in 2014 were primarily due to higher volumes in the us which were partially offset by higher material costs and approximately 9 million of incremental planned erp implementation costs operating margins were 147 percent in 2014 and 139 percent in 2013 adjusted segment operating margins were 156 percent in both 2014 and 2013 in 2012 operating margins were 140 percent and adjusted operating margins were 138 percent higher adjusted segment operating margins in 2013 as compared to 2012 were primarily due to higher incremental margins associated with increased volumes of water heaters and boilers in the us as well as lower material costs 

 

adjusted segment operating earnings in 2014 exclude 147 million of pretax nonoperating pension costs adjusted segment operating earnings in 2013 exclude 220 million of pretax restructuring and impairment charges associated with the transfer of production from fergus ontario an 110 million pretax gain on the settlement with a former supplier and 148 million of pretax nonoperating pension costs adjusted segment operating earnings in 2012 exclude a pretax gain of 39 million associated with a legal settlement with a component supplier for our canadian operations a 33 million favorable adjustment to our estimate of the lochinvar earnout obligation and 44 million of pretax nonoperating pension costs 

in order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business we are providing nongaap measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share adjusted segment operating earnings and adjusted segment operating margins that exclude certain items as well as nonoperating pension costs consisting of interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of actuarial gains losses and curtailments prior year results are provided on a comparable basis reconciliations to measures on a gaap basis are provided later in this section we do not plan to provide nongaap measures in 2015 

rest of world 

sales for our rest of world segment in 2014 were 7683 million or 1003 million higher than sales of 6680 million in 2013 due to an 184 percent increase in sales in china driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products and higher priced product mix that was partially offset by lower sales in india resulting from weakness in the housing market and the termination of a cobranding relationship with our largest distributor sales for our rest of world segment in 2013 were 1255 million higher than sales of 5425 million in 2012 due to increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products in china and market acceptance of our newer higher value a o smith branded products in china 

rest of world operating earnings were 1067 million in 2014 compared to operating earnings of 880 million and 596 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively segment operating margins were 139 percent in 2014 as compared to 132 percent and 110 percent in 2013 and 2012 respectively higher operating earnings and operating margins in 2014 were due to higher sales of water heaters and water treatment products in china as well as a higher priced product mix as a result of product introductions with higher value features which was partially offset by larger losses in india losses in india were 75 million in 2014 including approximately 1 million of product development and advertising expenses related to our planned 2015 launch of water treatment products higher operating earnings and margins in 2013 as compared to 2012 were due to higher volumes and a more favorable mix of water heaters and water treatment products in china that were partially offset by larger losses in india due to higher costs for new product introductions and brand building as well as devaluation of the indian rupee 

liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital was 7138 million at december 31 2014 compared with 6147 million and 6083 million at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively cash generated by our business in china and salesrelated increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels explain the majority of the increase in 2014 salesrelated increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels were partially offset by similar increases in accounts payable resulting in essentially no change in working capital in 2013 as compared to 2012 as of december 31 2014 all of the 5419 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries we would incur a cost to repatriate these funds to the us and have an accrual of 507 million for the repatriation of a portion of these funds 

operating cash provided by continuing operations during 2014 was 2657 million compared with 2822 million during 2013 and 1718 million during 2012 higher earnings in 2014 were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital the improvement in cash flows in 2013 was primarily due to higher earnings from operations and lower outlays for working capital we expect cash provided by operating activities in 2015 to be between 270 and 280 million 

our capital expenditures were 861 million in 2014 977 million in 2013 and 699 million in 2012 included in 2014 capital expenditures was approximately 32 million related to our erp implementation included in 2013 capital expenditures was approximately 45 million in china and india for the construction of a second water heater manufacturing plant in nanjing china and to continue the expansion of our manufacturing plant near bangalore india the new plant in china which opened in october 2013 is projected to add 50 percent more capacity when fully utilized to our china water heater operations to meet local demand we also continue to expand our india plant to accommodate more water heater models insource some component manufacturing and meet local demand approximately 19 million of expenditures in 2013 related to the implementation of our new erp system we are projecting 2015 capital expenditures of between 100 and 110 million and 2015 depreciation and amortization of approximately 66 million we expect capital spending in 2015 to include approximately 20 million related to our erp implementation and approximately 30 million related to capacity expansion in china and in the us for lochinvar branded products to support growth 

 

in december 2012 we completed a 400 million multicurrency five year revolving credit facility with a group of eight banks the facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to 500 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31 2014 

the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings and it expires on december 12 2017 as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt at december 31 2014 we had available borrowing capacity of 2195 million under this facility we believe that the combination of cash available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

our total debt increased to 2238 million at december 31 2014 compared with 1919 million at december 31 2013 as our cash flows generated in the us were more than offset by our share repurchase activity as a result our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 139 percent at the end of 2014 compared with 126 percent at the end of 2013 

our us pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations we were not required to make a contribution to our pension plan in 2014 and we did not make any voluntary contributions we forecast that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2015 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions in 2015 for further information on our pension plans see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during 2014 our board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional 3500000 shares of our common stock in 2014 we repurchased 2154783 shares at an average price of 4819 per share and at a total cost of 1038 million at december 31 2014 a total of 2497993 shares remained on the existing repurchase authorization depending on factors such as stock price working capital requirements and alternative investment opportunities we expect to spend approximately 100 million on stock repurchase activity in 2015 

we have paid dividends for 75 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 23 years we paid total dividends of 60 per share in 2014 compared with 46 per share in 2013 in january 2015 we increased our dividend and anticipate paying total dividends of 76 per share in 2015 

discontinued operations financial information is provided in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014 is as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2014 our liability for uncertain income tax positions was 12 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to our scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments that we consider firm 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards codification asc 60610 revenue from contracts with customers issued under accounting standards update no 201409 asc 60610 will replace all 

 

existing revenue recognition guidance when effective asc 60610 is effective for the year beginning january 1 2017 either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption is allowed under asc 60610 we are in the process of determining whether the adoption of asc 60610 will have an impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we monitor these significant factors and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an armslength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct annual thorough and competent valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment in goodwill or indefinitelived assets in 2014 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed on a periodic basis at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year in 2014 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 75 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million per occurrence 

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also use an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time at december 31 2014 our reserve for product liability was 408 million 

 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on plan assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 775 percent in 2014 compared to 800 percent in 2013 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs increased to 485 percent in 2014 from 405 percent in 2013 for 2015 our expected return on plan assets is 775 percent and our discount rate is 405 percent 

in developing our expected return on plan assets we evaluate our pension plan’s current and target asset allocation the expected longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is approximately 50 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers and real estate managers our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2014 was 50 percent to equity managers 37 percent to bond managers eight percent to real estate managers four percent to private equity managers and the remainder in money market instruments we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical tenyear and 25year compounded annualized returns are 69 percent and 96 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the expected longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 775 percent expected return on plan assets for 2015 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2014 and 2013 were based on the aonhewitt aa only above median yield curve which was designed by aonhewitt to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the aa only above median curve represents a series of annual discount rates from bonds with aa minimum average rating as rated by moody’s investor service standard poor’s and fitch ratings we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

we estimate that we will recognize minimal pension expense in 2015 compared to 286 million in 2014 we have made changes to our pension plan including closing the plan to new entrants effective january 1 2010 and the sunset of our plan for the majority of our employees on december 31 2014 which we believe will significantly decrease pension expense beginning in 2015 lowering the expected return on plan assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2015 by approximately 19 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would decrease our 2015 net pension expense by approximately 01 million 

nongaap measures 

we provide nongaap measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment operating earnings that exclude certain items as well as nonoperating pension costs consisting of interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of actuarial gains losses and curtailments we believe that these components of pension cost better reflect ongoing operating related costs of providing pension benefits to our employees 

as such we believe that the measures of adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment operating earnings provide management and investors with a useful measure of our operational results we have prepared quarterly and annual reconciliations of adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment operating earnings for the years 20122014 which have been provided in the supplemental financial data documents posted in the investor relations section on our website in addition to the following reconciliations

outlook 

as we enter 2015 we continue to expect strong profitable growth in china driven by expected continued overall market growth market share gains improved product mix and water treatment growth we expect sales in 2015 in china to grow at the rate of approximately two times the rate of china’s gross domestic product growth in the us we believe an expected continued transition from noncondensing lower efficiency boilers to condensing higher efficiency boilers as well as continued new product introductions will allow lochinvar branded sales to continue the ten percent pace of growth in 2015 we believe residential and commercial water heater volumes in the us will be flat or show modest growth in 2015 as we expect new construction activity to slowly improve an energy efficiency regulatory change impacting approximately 80 percent of us residential water heaters will become effective april 16 2015 our new compliant products are more expensive to manufacture and we announced an average price increase of approximately 20 percent on these products we expect some operating inefficiencies and onetime costs in the first half of 2015 as we implement the changeover to the new compliant residential water heater line 

combining all these factors we expect 2015 sales to increase approximately ten percent from 2014 and 2015 earnings to be in the range of 265 to 280 per share 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal foreign state local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2014 and are not expected to be material in any single year we have reserves associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2014 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 1415 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 142 million gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2014 we had 1805 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 13 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 02 million

 item 1  business 

we are a leading manufacturer of water heaters and boilers serving a diverse mix of residential and commercial end markets principally in the united states us with a strong and growing international presence our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china europe and india both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential gas gas tankless and electric water heaters and commercial water heating equipment both segments primarily serve their respective regions of the world the north america segment also manufactures and markets specialty commercial water heating equipment condensing and noncondensing boilers and water systems tanks the rest of world segment also manufactures and markets water treatment products primarily for asia 

on august 22 2011 we sold our electrical products business epc to regal beloit corporation rbc for approximately 760 million in cash and approximately 283 million shares of rbc common stock valued at 1406 million as of that date due to the sale epc has been reflected as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented for further information about epc see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table summarizes our sales from continuing operations this summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item 8 in this document 

 

 north america 

in our north america segment sales increased 62 percent or 892 million in 2013 compared with the prior year higher volumes of us residential and commercial water heaters and boilers partially offset by lower volumes of canadian water heaters are the primary reasons for an increase in sales compared with the prior year our lochinvar brand which we acquired in august 2011 incrementally added 1429 million to sales in 2012 compared to 2011 approximately 40 percent of lochinvarbranded sales consist of residential and commercial water heaters while the remaining 60 percent of lochinvarbranded sales consist primarily of boilers and related parts 

we serve residential and commercial end markets in north america with a broad range of products including 

gas gas tankless and electric water heaters  our residential and commercial water heaters come in sizes ranging from 25 gallon pointofuse models to 12500 gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges we offer electric natural gas and liquid propane models as well as gas tankless and solar tank units for energy efficient homes our north american residential water heater sales in 2013 were approximately 950 million or 63 percent of north america revenues typical applications for our water heaters include residences restaurants hotels and motels laundries car washes and small businesses 

boilers our residential and commercial boilers range in size from 40000 british thermal units btus to 50 million btus our commercial boilers are used primarily in space heating applications including hospitals schools hotels and other large commercial buildings 

other our north america segment also manufactures expansion tanks commercial solar water heating systems swimming pool and spa heaters and related products and parts 

a significant portion of the segment’s business is derived from the replacement of existing products and we believe that since 2008 the sale of products to the north america residential new housing construction market has represented less than ten percent of our north america residential water heater sales 

we are the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in north america and we have a leading share in both the residential and commercial markets in the commercial market we believe our comprehensive product line including boilers and our highefficiency products give us a competitive advantage in this portion of the water heating industry our wholesale distribution channel includes more than 1200 independent wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 4400 selling 

 

locations serving residential and commercial end markets we also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel in this channel our customers include five of the seven largest national hardware and home center chains including longstanding exclusive branding relationships with both lowe’s and sears our boiler distribution channel is primarily comprised of manufacturer representative firms 

we acquired lochinvar in 2011 for approximately 435 million including an earnout provision that resulted in a payment of 135 million in december 2012 our lochinvar brand is one of the leading brands of residential and commercial boilers in the us 

our energy efficient product offerings continue to be a sales driver of our business our cyclone product family and our commercial boilers continue to be an option for commercial customers looking for high efficiency water and space heating with a short payback period through energy savings we offer residential heat pump and solar water heaters in north america as well as other higher efficiency water heating solutions to round out our energy efficient product offerings 

we sell our water heating products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design quality of products and services performance and price our principal water heating and boiler competitors in north america include rheem bradford white rinnai navien aerco and cleaverbrooks numerous other manufacturing companies also compete 

rest of world 

sales in our rest of world segment increased 231 percent or 1255 million in 2013 compared with the prior year a 261 percent increase in sales of a o smith branded products in china to 5652 million was the primary source of the increase in sales 

we have operated in china for almost 20 years in that time we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building a o smith brand recognition in the chinese residential and commercial markets the chinese market is predominantly comprised of electric wallhung solar and gas tankless water heaters we believe we are one of the leading suppliers of water heaters to the residential market in china with a broad product offering including electric gas gas tankless heat pump and solar units we also manufacture and market water treatment products primarily in the residential market 

we sell water heaters in more than 5900 retail outlets in china of which over 1200 exclusively sell our products in addition our water treatment products are sold in 2900 retail outlets in china 

in 2008 we established a sales office in india and began importing products specifically designed for india from our nanjing china facility we began manufacturing water heaters in india in the second quarter of 2010 our sales in india were 203 million in 2013 essentially the same as in 2012 

our primary competitor in china is haier appliances a chinese company but we also compete with midea in the electric water heater market and rinnai and noritz in the gas tankless and solar water heater markets additionally we compete with numerous other chinese private and stateowned water heater and water treatment companies in china in india we compete with bajaj mtsracold venus and numerous other companies 

in addition we sell water heaters to the european and middle eastern markets and water treatment products in turkey all of which comprised approximately eight percent of total rest of world sales 

raw material 

raw materials for our manufacturing operations primarily consisting of steel are generally available in adequate quantities a portion of our customers are contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in steel prices there has been significant volatility in steel costs over the last several years 

research and development 

to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin at our global engineering center in nanjing china and at our operating locations total expenditures for research and development in 2013 2012 and 2011 were 578 million 517 million and 427 million respectively 

 

patents and trademarks 

we own and use in our businesses various trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and licenses we do not believe that our business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such trademark trade name patent trade secret or license however our trade name is important with respect to our products particularly in china india and the us 

employees 

our operations employed approximately 11400 employees as of december 31 2013 primarily nonunion 

backlog 

due to the shortcycle nature of our businesses none of our operations sustain significant backlogs 

environmental laws 

our operations are governed by a variety of federal foreign state and local laws intended to protect the environment compliance with environmental laws has not had and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of our company see item 3

 item 1a – risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

 

 the global economy is still showing signs of stress and could stall or reverse the course of any recovery if this were to occur it could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition or slower adoption of energy efficient water heaters and boilers which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows in addition a deterioration in current economic conditions including credit market conditions could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials or increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our sales growth in china has averaged approximately 25 percent per year over the past five years and we anticipate sales growing approximately two times the rate of china’s gross domestic product growth in 2014 in 2013 we opened a second manufacturing facility that will expand our manufacturing capacity by 50 percent when fully utilized if the chinese economy were to experience a significant slowdown or urbanization was to stall it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we introduced our 2015 financial aspirations in late 2012 and updated them in 2013 and 2014 we identified specific growth expectations for our a o smith branded products in china our us residential and commercial water heaters our lochinvarbranded products our water treatment products and our products sold in india we identified earnings before interest and taxes ebit margin aspirations for our north america and rest of world segments failure to profitably grow as expected could negatively impact our ability to achieve these aspirations failure to achieve one or more of these growth aspirations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

 net sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 38 percent of our 2013 net sales we expect that customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our dependence on sales from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products to our competitors the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or our inability to execute on pricing actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the recovery in commercial construction activity in north america is fragile and commercial construction could decline again after showing improvements in 2013 though we believe that the majority of the commercial business we serve is for replacement of existing products changes in the commercial construction market could affect us 

 

 the compound annual growth rate of lochinvarbranded revenues has been over ten percent per year since our acquisition of lochinvar largely due to the transition in the boiler industry in the us from lower efficiency noncondensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers and our lochinvar brand is a leader in residential and commercial condensing boilers in 2003 approximately five percent of the boilers sold in the us were condensing boilers and by 2012 the percentage had grown to approximately 40 percent we expect the transition to continue which would result in approximately ten percent growth in lochinvarbranded sales in 2014 and for the foreseeable future after 2014 if the transition to higher efficiency condensing boilers stalls as a result of lower energy costs another recession occurs or our competitors’ technologies surpass our technology our growth rate could be lower than expected 

 

 we depend on information technology to record and process customers’ orders manufacture and ship products in a timely manner and maintain the financial accuracy of our business records we are in the process of implementing a global enterprise resource planning system erp that will redesign and deploy new processes and a common information system across our plants over a period of several years there is no certainty that this system will deliver the expected benefits the failure to achieve our goals may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently which could increase costs impacting profitability or otherwise impact our business in addition the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue also our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets 

 

 approximately 38 percent of our 2013 net sales were attributable to products sold outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent in europe and india approximately 6600 of our 11400 total employees as of december 31 2013 were located in china at december 31 2013 approximately 240 million of our cash and marketable securities balances were located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade restrictions the impact of foreign government regulations the effects of income taxes governmental expropriation the imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries labor relations problems the imposition of environmental or employment laws or other restrictions by foreign governments and differences in business practices we may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause a loss of revenue unfavorable changes in the political regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the us as of december 31 2013 approximately 486 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries the company would incur a cost to repatriate these funds to the us 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price we compete against manufacturers located primarily in north america and china some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing research and development and distribution resources than we have we cannot assure that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our success may depend on our ability to adapt to technological changes in the water heating boiler and water treatment industries if we are unable to timely develop and introduce new products or enhance existing products in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or demands our competitiveness could be materially and adversely affected our ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop acquire and retain necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success but cannot reasonably be assured 

 

 acquisitions we have made have had a significant impact on our results of operations while we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and we intend to use a significant portion of our available capital for future acquisitions we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms utilize cash flows from operations obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future if we complete any future acquisitions then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions in new geographies our unfamiliarity with local regulations and market customs may impact our ability to operate them profitably or achieve our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing the impact of future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we have significant operations outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent europe and india and therefore hold assets incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in our consolidated financial statements as a result we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates or hyperinflation in some foreign countries furthermore typically our products are priced in foreign countries in local currencies as a result an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our foreign markets could have a negative effect on our profitability in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries’ functional currency these risks may hurt our reported sales and profits in the future or negatively impact revenues and earnings translated from foreign currencies into us dollars 

 

 our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements related to among other items energy efficiency environmental emissions labeling and safety specifically we are currently redesigning our residential water heater product offerings in the us to meet new mandated energy conservation standards by april 16 2015 and adapting to a proposed revision by the us department of energy to the method of testing used to determine compliance with such energy standards for us water heaters while we believe our products are currently efficient safe and environmentfriendly and we are on course to comply with the new energy standards and method of testing in the us an inability to comply with the proposed requirements or a significant change to these regulatory requirements whether federal foreign state or local or otherwise to industry standards could substantially increase manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 product defects can occur through our own product development design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities we may incur various expenses related to product defects including product warranty costs product recall and retrofit costs while we maintain a reserve for product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve resulting in current period expenses and a need to increase our reserves for warranty charges in addition product defects and recalls may diminish the reputation of our brand further our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 attracting and retaining talented employees is important to the continued success of our business failure to retain key personnel particularly on the leadership team would have a material effect on our business and our ability to execute our business strategies in a timely and effective manner 

 

 the market prices for certain raw materials we purchase primarily steel have been very volatile significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in our ability to recover increased material costs from customers and that lag could negatively impact our profitability in addition in some cases we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components we require in the manufacture of our products a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a nonus government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws which are complex may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our water heating boiler and water treatment products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture sale and use of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will be able to ultimately pay all insured losses in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 due to the significant negative investment returns in 2008 and falling interest rates in recent years the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately 115 million at december 31 2013 us employees hired after january 1 2010 have not participated in our defined benefit plan and benefit accruals for the majority of current salaried and hourly employees will stop at the end of 2014 beginning in 2008 our minimum required pension contributions equal our target normal cost plus a seven year amortization of any funding shortfall offset by any employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa credit balance we are forecasting that there will be no required contributions to the plan in 2014 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions however we cannot provide any assurance that contributions will not be required in the future among the key assumptions inherent in our actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to making the contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing the company 

 

 our total assets include significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase prices we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there has been impairments in the value of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at our businesses do not meet expectations we may be required to reflect noncash charges to operating results for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairments the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets may affect our ability to maintain the debttocapital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals known as conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries as a result in august 2012 the sec adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the drc and adjoining countries in their products these new requirements will require country of origin inquiries and potentially due diligence with initial disclosure requirements beginning in may 2014 relating to activities in 2013 there will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for country of origin inquiries and due diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” conflict minerals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement 

 

 we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock currently are entitled as a class to elect only onethird of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit smith family have entered into a voting trust agreement with respect to shares of our class a common stock and shares of our common stock they own as of december 31 2013 these members of the smith family own approximately 603 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and common stock taken together as a single class and approximately 951 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock as a separate class due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and shares of our class a common stock the smith family is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control this ownership position may increase if other members of the smith family enter into the voting trust agreement and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our class a common stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our common stock the voting trust agreement provides that in the event one of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our class a common stock such shares of our class a common stock are automatically exchanged for shares of our common stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust in addition the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our class a common stock and our common stock proposed to be withdrawn or transferred from the trust as a result the smith family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the smith family decide to transfer their shares

 item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a leading manufacturer of water heaters and boilers serving a diverse mix of residential and commercial end markets principally in the us with a strong and growing international presence our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas gas tankless and electric water heaters both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective region of the world our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china europe and india the north america segment also manufactures and globally markets specialty commercial water heating equipment condensing and noncondensing boilers and water systems tanks the rest of world segment also manufactures and markets water treatment products primarily for asia on august 22 2011 we sold epc to rbc for approximately 760 million in cash and approximately 283 million shares of rbc common stock valued at 1406 million as of that date due to the sale epc has been reflected as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented in 2013 sales for our north america segment were 15200 million and sales for our rest of world segment were 6680 million 

sales of our rest of world a o smith branded products in china grew significantly in 2013 we expect sales in china to grow at the rate of approximately two times the rate of china’s gross domestic product growth in 2014 as geographic expansion market share gains growth in water treatment and improved product mix contribute to our growth the residential replacement market contributed significantly to 2013 sales in our north america segment our 2013 north america residential unit sales grew midsingle digits compared to the prior year and commercial sales showed modest unit growth we expect the north america residential and commercial water heater industry unit growth to each be one to two percent in 2014 lochinvarbranded products contributed over 250 million to our net sales in 2013 and we expect further sales growth of lochinvarbranded products of over ten percent in 2014 driven by sales of energy efficient products approximately 40 percent of lochinvarbranded sales consist of residential and commercial water heaters while the remaining 60 percent of lochinvarbranded sales consist primarily of boilers and related parts 

on april 15 2013 our board of directors declared a twoforone stock split of our class a common stock and common stock in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend to stockholders of record on april 30 2013 and payable on may 15 2013 

our stated acquisition strategy includes a number of our waterrelated strategic initiatives we will look to continue to grow our core residential and commercial water heating boiler and water treatment businesses throughout the world we will also continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing operations in the high growth regions of china and india 

consistent with our stated strategy to expand our core product offering we acquired lochinvar in 2011 lochinvar one of the leading manufacturers of residential and commercial boilers in the us fit squarely within our stated strategic growth initiative to expand our core water heating business in 2012 approximately 40 percent of boilers sold in the us were condensing boilers compared with five percent eight years ago our lochinvar brand is a leading brand of higher efficiency condensing boilers we expect the transition in the us to higher efficiency boilers will continue into the foreseeable future we paid for lochinvar using a combination of cash on hand and amounts that we borrowed under our credit facility 

results of operations 

our sales in 2013 were a record 21538 million surpassing 2012 sales of 19393 million by 111 percent the increase in sales is due to a 261 percent increase in sales of a o smith branded products in china to 5652 million as well as higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters and boilers in the us our sales in 2012 were higher than 2011 sales from continuing operations of 17105 million by 134 percent the increase in sales in 2012 was attributable mostly to sales of lochinvarbranded products we acquired lochinvar in august 2011 and sales of lochinvarbranded products totaled 2257 million in 2012 compared with 759 million in 2011 additionally sales of a o smith branded products in china grew 205 percent to 4483 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

our gross profit margin in 2013 increased to 359 percent from 336 percent in 2012 the higher gross profit margin in 2013 was primarily due to the contribution from increased sales volumes of water heaters and boilers in the us lower material costs in the us and higher sales of a o smith branded products in china as well as higher priced product mix as a result of product introductions with higher value features and benefits in china our 2012 gross profit margin increased 36 percent from 300 percent for continuing operations in 2011 the impact of the addition of relatively higher margin sales of lochinvarbranded products increased sales of a o smith branded products in china and lower manufacturing and warranty costs in north america contributed to higher gross profit margins in 2012 

 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 740 million higher in 2013 than in 2012 the increase in sga expenses in 2013 to 5245 million was primarily due to higher selling and advertising costs in support of increased volumes in north america and china as well as higher pension expenses in north america sga expenses were 777 million higher in 2012 than in 2011 due to higher selling and advertising costs in support of increased volumes in china additional expenses from a full year of lochinvar operations and increased pension expenses in north america 

on march 28 2013 our board of directors approved a plan to transfer residential water heater production from our fergus ontario plant to our other north american facilities the majority of our production was consolidated in the second quarter of 2013 as a result of the capacity rationalization we incurred pretax restructuring and impairment expenses of 220 million in 2013 related to employee severance costs impairments of assets and equipment relocation costs these activities are reflected in the “restructuring impairment and settlement expense income net” line in the accompanying financial statements we expect pretax annual savings of approximately 10 million in 2014 as a result of these actions which would represent an incremental 5 million of pretax savings as compared to 2013 

in addition included in operating earnings in 2013 is a pretax gain of 110 million resulting from a settlement with a former supplier related to previous overcharges and warranty costs operating earnings in 2012 included a pretax gain of 39 million associated with a legal settlement with a component supplier for our canadian operations our 2011 operating earnings included a pretax gain of 112 million from a legal settlement with a component supplier for our us operations these gains are also reflected in the “restructuring impairment and settlement expense income net” line in the accompanying financial statements 

also included in 2012 operating earnings is a 33 million favorable adjustment related to the finalization of an earnout obligation from our acquisition of lochinvar this earnout adjustment is reflected as “contingent consideration adjustment” in the accompanying financial statements 

pension expense in 2013 was 279 million compared to 138 million and 33 million for continuing operations in 2012 and 2011 respectively the increases in pension expense in 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to increases in the amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses in these years in addition to decreases in the expected rate of return on plan assets 

interest expense in 2013 was 57 million compared to interest expense of 92 million in 2012 the higher interest expense in 2012 was due to higher debt levels as a result of the lochinvar acquisition in 2011 in addition in 2011 we sold our electrical products company epc to regal beloit corporation rbc and received 283 million shares of rbc common stock during 2012 we sold all of our shares of rbc common stock the net proceeds of which were used to pay down debt in 2012 interest expense for continuing operations was 93 million in 2011 interest expense in 2011 is net of the amount allocated to discontinued operations interest expense that could not be attributed to specific entities within the company was allocated to epc based on the ratio of net assets to be sold to the sum of the consolidated net assets and debt exclusive of debt attributable to specific entities of the company 

net other income was 38 million in 2013 down from 343 million in 2012 other income in 2012 was comprised primarily of 272 million pretax gains on the sale of the shares of rbc common stock received in the sale of epc net of the impact of the rbc share collar discussed below with most of the remainder of 2012 net other income resulting from interest income on investments resulting from the sale of epc other income was 198 million in 2011 we received the rbc common stock in august 2011 under an agreement that we executed in december 2010 the rbc share price appreciated in 2011 during which we entered into an equity collar contract for 50 percent of the shares that we expected to receive to protect a portion of the appreciation the collar did not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore was adjusted to fair value through earnings from continuing operations at the end of 2011 the contract was marked to market under accounting rules resulting in a 179 million pretax gain during 2011 the market price of the shares of rbc common stock we received increased by 136 per share from the date of the sale of epc until the end of 2011 resulting in a 19 million pretax gain on the 50 percent of shares covered by the collar contract the resulting net gain on shares of rbc common stock activity of 198 million in 2011 was recorded in other income from continuing operations 

our effective tax rate was 282 percent in 2013 compared with 304 percent and 311 percent for continuing operations in 2012 and 2011 respectively the rate decline in 2013 from 2012 was primarily due to increased profits in jurisdictions with lower enacted income tax rates than the us principally china and research tax credits the rate decline in 2012 from 2011 was due to larger than anticipated tax deductions resulting from our domestic production activities deduction 

our 2012 net earnings include discontinued operations aftertax losses of 39 million or 04 per diluted share related to the sale of epc which occurred in 2011 included in discontinued operations in 2012 was 64 million of expense representing the correction of an error primarily due to our calculation of taxes due upon repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings our 2011 net earnings include discontinued operations of 1945 million or 209 per diluted share related to epc 

 

north america 

sales in our north america segment were 15200 million in 2013 or 892 million higher than sales of 14308 million in 2012 the sales increase in 2013 was primarily due to higher sales of residential and commercial water heaters and boilers in the us sales in 2012 were 1413 million higher than sales of 12895 million in 2011 the sales increase in 2012 included 1429 million of incremental sales from lochinvarbranded products resulting from our acquisition of lochinvar which we completed on august 26 2011 we also experienced higher volumes of us residential and commercial water heaters which were offset by lower gas tankless and canadian water heater volumes in 2012 

north america operating earnings were 2119 million in 2013 as compared to operating earnings of 1998 million and 1540 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively adjusted segment operating earnings were 2377 million in 2013 as compared to adjusted segment operating earnings of 1970 million and 1492 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively operating margins were 139 percent in 2013 and 140 percent in 2012 adjusted segment operating margins were 156 percent in 2013 compared to 138 percent in 2012 higher adjusted segment operating margins in 2013 were primarily due to higher incremental margins associated with increased volumes of water heaters and boilers in the us as well as lower material costs in 2011 operating margins were 119 percent and adjusted operating margins were 116 percent incremental higher margin sales from our lochinvar acquisition and higher us residential and commercial volumes contributed to the increase in 2012 adjusted segment operating earnings and adjusted margins as compared to 2011 

adjusted segment operating earnings in 2013 exclude 220 million of pretax restructuring and impairment charges associated with the transfer of production from fergus ontario an 110 million pretax gain on the settlement with a former supplier and 148 million of pretax nonoperating pension costs adjusted segment operating earnings in 2012 exclude a pretax gain of 39 million associated with a legal settlement with a component supplier for our canadian operations a 33 million favorable adjustment to our estimate of the lochinvar earnout obligation and 44 million of pretax nonoperating pension costs adjusted segment operating earnings in 2011 exclude a net pretax gain of 30 million from a legal settlement with a component supplier for our us operations and an increase to a warranty reserve associated with the canadian component supplier and 18 million of pretax nonoperating pension adjustments 

we are providing nongaap measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share adjusted segment operating earnings and adjusted segment operating margins that exclude certain items as well as nonoperating pension costs consisting of interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of actuarial gains losses and curtailments prior year results are provided on a comparable basis reconciliations to measures on a gaap basis are provided later in this section 

rest of world 

sales for our rest of world segment in 2013 were 6680 million or 1255 million higher than sales of 5425 million in 2012 due to increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products in china and market acceptance of our newer higher value a o smith branded products in china sales for our rest of world segment in 2012 were 869 million higher than sales of 4556 million in 2011 due to a higher priced product mix in the region as a result of product innovations with more robust features and benefits as well as pricing actions 

rest of world operating earnings were 880 million in 2013 compared to operating earnings of 596 million and 427 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively segment operating margins were 132 percent in 2013 as compared to 110 percent and 94 percent in 2012 and 2011 respectively higher operating earnings and margins in 2013 were due to higher volumes a more favorable mix of a o smith branded products in china and 5 million lower losses for the nona o smith branded water treatment business that were partially offset by larger losses in india due to higher costs for new product introductions and brand building as well as currency devaluation the 169 million increase in operating earnings in 2012 was driven by higher volumes of a o smith branded products in china and 3 million of reduced losses for the nona o smith branded water treatment business which were partially offset by larger losses in india due to new product introduction costs and brand building expenses in the region the 2011 operating earnings and operating margins were impacted by losses of 102 million in the nona o smith branded water treatment business resulting from lower sales and costs associated with moving to a new manufacturing facility in 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital from continuing operations was 6147 million at december 31 2013 compared with 6083 million and 7279 million at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively salesrelated increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels were partially offset by similar increases in accounts payable resulting in essentially no change in working capital in 2013 the 1196 million decline in working capital in 2012 was primarily due to the sale of our shares of rbc common stock which were received as a result of our divestiture of epc the proceeds from the sale of the rbc common stock were used to repay debt the sale of the rbc common stock more than offset a 570 million salesrelated increase in accounts receivable as of december 31 2013 all of the 4860 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries we would incur a cost to repatriate these funds to the us and have accrued 564 million for the repatriation of a portion of these funds 

 

operating cash provided by continuing operations during 2013 was 2822 million compared with 1718 million during 2012 and 610 million during 2011 the improvement in cash flows in 2013 was primarily due to higher earnings from operations and lower outlays for working capital the improvement in cash flows in 2012 was primarily related to higher earnings from operations and the impact in 2011 of pretax pension contributions of approximately 175 million partially offset by lower working capital requirements we expect cash provided by operating activities in 2014 to be between 235 and 245 million 

our capital expenditures for continuing operations were 977 million in 2013 699 million in 2012 and 535 million in 2011 included in 2013 capital expenditures was approximately 45 million in china and india for the continued construction of a second water heater manufacturing plant in nanjing china and to continue the expansion of our manufacturing plant near bangalore india the new plant in china which we opened in october 2013 is projected to add 50 percent more capacity when fully utilized to our china water heater operations to meet local demand we also continue to expand our india plant to accommodate more water heater models insource some component manufacturing and meet local demand approximately 19 million of expenditures in 2013 related to the implementation of our new erp system capital expenditures in 2012 were higher than in 2011 as a result of construction activity for the second water heater plant in china we are projecting 2014 capital expenditures of between 75 and 85 million and 2014 depreciation and amortization of approximately 65 million we expect capital spending in 2014 to include approximately 20 million to support our erp implementation 

in december 2012 we completed a 400 million multicurrency five year revolving credit facility with a group of eight banks the facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to 500 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31 2013 

the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings and it expires on december 12 2017 as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt at december 31 2013 we had available borrowing capacity of 2675 million under this facility we believe that the combination of cash available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

our total debt declined to 1919 million at december 31 2013 compared with 2437 million at december 31 2012 due to cash flows generated in the us as a result our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 126 percent at the end of 2013 compared with 169 percent at the end of 2012 

our us pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations we were not required to make a contribution to our pension plan in 2013 and we did not make any voluntary contributions we are forecasting that there will be no required contributions to the plan in 2014 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions for further information on our pension plans see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in july 2013 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of an additional 2000000 shares of our common stock in 2013 we repurchased 1771066 shares at an average price of 4162 per share and at a total cost of 737 million at december 31 2013 a total of 1152776 shares remained on the existing repurchase authorization 

we have paid dividends for 74 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 22 years we paid total dividends of 46 per share in 2013 compared with 36 per share in 2012 

discontinued operations financial information is provided in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2013 is as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2013 our liability for uncertain income tax positions was 13 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to our scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments that we consider firm 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2012 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201202 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment  asu 201202 allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether events and circumstances indicate that it is morelikelythan not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if an entity determines that it is not morelikelythan not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is not required to perform a quantitative impairment test asu 201202 was effective for the year ending december 31 2013 the adoption of this asu did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201302 comprehensive income topic 220 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  asu no 201302 sets requirements for presentation for significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income in reporting periods presented asu 201302 was effective prospectively beginning with the quarter ended march 31 2013 the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations but required additional disclosure in the notes to our financial statements we complied with the disclosure requirements of asu 201302 for the year ended december 31 2013 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we monitor these significant factors and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value 

 

represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an armslength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct annual thorough and competent valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment in goodwill or indefinitelived assets in 2013 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed on a periodic basis at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year in 2013 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 75 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million per occurrence 

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also use an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time at december 31 2013 our reserve for product liability was 427 million 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on plan assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 800 percent in 2013 compared to 850 percent in 2012 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs decreased to 405 percent in 2013 from 490 percent in 2012 for 2014 our expected return on plan assets is 775 percent and our discount rate is 485 percent 

in developing our expected return on plan assets we evaluate our pension plan’s current and target asset allocation the expected longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is approximately 50 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers and real estate managers our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2013 was 53 percent to equity managers 34 percent to bond managers seven percent to real estate managers five percent to private equity managers and the remainder in money market instruments we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical tenyear and 25year compounded annualized returns are 64 percent and 98 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the expected longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 775 percent expected return on plan assets for 2014 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2013 and 2012 were based on the aonhewitt aa only above median yield curve which was designed by aonhewitt to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the aa only above median curve represents a series of annual discount rates from bonds with aa minimum average rating as rated by moody’s investor service moody’s sp and fitch we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

 

we estimate that we will recognize approximately 283 million of pension expense in 2014 compared to 279 million in 2013 lowering the expected return on plan assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2014 by approximately 20 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2014 net pension expense by approximately 15 million 

we provide nongaap measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment operating earnings that exclude certain items as well as nonoperating pension costs consisting of interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of actuarial gains losses and curtailments we believe that these components of pension cost better reflect ongoing operating related costs of providing pension benefits to the company’s employees in addition we have made changes to our pension plan including closing the plan to new entrants effective january 1 2010 and freezing the plan for the majority of our existing participants effective january 1 2015 which we believe will significantly decrease pension expense beginning in 2015 

as such we believe that the measures of adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment operating earnings provide management and investors with a useful measure of our operational results we have prepared quarterly and annual reconciliations of adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment operating earnings for the years 20112014 which have been provided in the supplemental financial data documents posted in the investor relations section on our website in addition to the following reconciliations

 outlook 

as we enter 2014 the year in which we celebrate our 140 th anniversary we are cautiously optimistic we believe an improving housing market will provide additional opportunities for our north american residential water heating business the replacement market for commercial water heaters will continue to be solid and the boiler industry will continue its transition from lower efficiency to higher efficiency products which benefit our boiler sales 

we anticipate our sales in china will grow at the rate of approximately two times the rate of china’s gross domestic product growth and the added capacity from our new plant in nanjing will support our growth for 2014 we expect the impact of higher volumes and incremental savings from our north american plant rationalization activities to be partially offset by approximately 10 million of incremental costs associated with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system and a higher effective income tax rate combining all these factors we expect to achieve fullyear gaap earnings of between 201 and 216 per share and adjusted earnings of between 215 and 230 per share neither of which includes the potential impact from future acquisitions 

strong performance in our north america segment in 2013 prompted us to update our 2015 aspirations our aspiration for organic sales for the total company is over 25 billion by 2015 and our gaap earnings aspirations for our existing portfolio of businesses is now 250 per share by 2015 versus the previously disclosed 225 per share 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal foreign state local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2013 and are not expected to be material in any single year we have reserves associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2013 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 995 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 100 million gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2013 we had 1325 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 12 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 02 million

 item 1 – business 

we are a leading manufacturer of water heaters and boilers serving a diverse mix of residential and commercial end markets principally in the united states us with a strong and growing international presence during the fourth quarter of 2011 we reorganized our management reporting structure to reflect our current business activities and reconsidered our reporting segments historical information has been revised to reflect our new structure our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china india and europe both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential gas gas tankless and electric water heaters and commercial water heating equipment both segments primarily serve their respective regions of the world the north america segment also manufactures and markets specialty commercial water heating equipment condensing and noncondensing boilers and water systems tanks the rest of world segment also manufactures and markets water treatment products primarily for asia 

on august 22 2011 we sold our electrical products business epc to regal beloit corporation rbc for approximately 760 million in cash and approximately 283 million shares of rbc common stock valued at 1406 million as of that date due to the sale epc has been reflected as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented for further information about epc see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table summarizes our sales from continuing operations this summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item 8 in this document 

 

 north america 

in our north america segment sales increased 110 percent or 1413 million in 2012 compared with the prior year our lochinvar brand which we acquired in august 2011 incrementally added 1429 million to sales the impact of the lochinvar acquisition and higher volumes of us residential and commercial water heaters which were partially offset by lower volumes of gas tankless and canadian water heaters are the primary reasons for an increase in sales compared with the prior year 

we serve residential and commercial end markets in north america with a broad range of products including 

gas gas tankless and electric water heaters  our residential and commercial water heaters come in sizes ranging from 25 gallon pointofuse models to 12500 gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges we offer electric natural gas and liquid propane models as well as solar tanks and gas tankless units for today’s energy efficient homes our north american residential water heater sales in 2012 were approximately 900 million or 63 percent of north america revenues typical applications for our water heaters include residences restaurants hotels and motels laundries car washes and small businesses 

boilers our residential and commercial boilers range in size from 40000 british thermal units btus to 50 million btus our commercial boilers are used primarily in space heating applications including hospitals schools hotels and other large commercial buildings 

other our north america segment also manufactures coppertube boilers and expansion tanks commercial solar systems swimming pool and spa heaters and related products and parts 

a significant portion of the segment’s business is derived from the replacement of existing products and we believe that since 2008 the sale of products to the north america residential new housing construction market has represented less than ten percent of the segment’s total residential water heater sales 

we are the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in north america and we have a leading share in both the residential and commercial markets as the leader in the residential water heating market we offer an extensive line of highefficiency gas and electric water heaters as well as boilers in the commercial market we believe our comprehensive product 

  

line including boilers and our highefficiency products give us a competitive advantage in this portion of the water heating industry our wholesale distribution channel includes more than 1200 independent wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 4400 selling locations serving residential and commercial end markets we also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel in this channel our customers include five of the seven largest national hardware and home center chains including longstanding exclusive branding relationships with both lowe’s companies inc and sears roebuck and co our boiler distribution channel is primarily comprised of manufacturer representative firms 

we acquired lochinvar for approximately 435 million which included an earnout provision that resulted in a payment of 135 million in december 2012 our lochinvar brand is one of the leading brands of residential and commercial boilers in the us our lochinvar branded sales for the 12 months ended december 31 2012 were approximately 226 million sales of lochinvar branded products have grown at a nine percent compound annual growth rate over the last five years 

in 2010 we acquired the rights from takagi industrial co ltd of fujicity shizuoka japan takagi to market gas tankless water heaters in north america and entered into a longterm agreement with takagi to supply gas tankless water heaters as part of the venture we took over the management of takagi’s north american sales and distribution organization through this venture we offer a full line of gas tankless water heaters under our own brands in association with the takagi brand 

our energy efficient product offerings continue to be a sales driver of our business our cyclone product family continues to be an option for commercial customers looking for high efficiency water heating with a short payback period through energy savings we offer the icomm remote monitoring service that allows customers to view their cyclone water heaters’ operation via the internet allowing them to track the energy usage and savings in 2010 we introduced residential solar and heat pump water heaters in the us as well as other higher efficiency water heating solutions to round out our energy efficient product offerings 

we sell our water heating products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design quality of products and services performance and price our principal water heating and boiler competitors in the us include rheem bradford white aerco weilmclain and htp and numerous other boiler manufacturing companies 

rest of world 

sales in our rest of world segment increased 191 percent or 869 million in 2012 compared with the prior year a 205 percent increase in sales of a o smith branded products in china to 4483 million was the primary source of the increase in sales 

we entered the chinese water heater market through a joint venture in 1995 buying out our partner three years later since that time we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building a o smith brand recognition in the chinese residential and commercial markets we believe we are one of the leading suppliers of water heaters to the residential market in china with a broad product offering including electric gas gas tankless heat pump and solar units 

in 2008 we established a sales office in india and began importing products specifically designed for india from our nanjing china facility we began manufacturing water heaters in india in the second quarter of 2010 our sales in india increased 105 percent to 200 million in 2012 

in 2009 we purchased 80 percent of the water treatment business of tianlong holding co ltd of hong kong tianlong and we are operating the business as a o smith shanghai water treatment products co ltd swt we manufacture and through our current water heater distribution channels supply water treatment products such as reverse osmosis units to the china residential and commercial markets as well as export markets throughout the world in 2010 we purchased the remaining 20 percent interest in tianlong 

our primary competitor in china is haier appliances a chinese company but we also compete with ariston siemens and midea in the electric water heater market and rinnai and noritz in the gas tankless water heater market additionally we compete with numerous other chinese private and stateowned water heater and water treatment companies in china in india we compete with bajaj mtsracold and venus and numerous other companies 

in addition we sell water heaters to the european and middle eastern markets which comprise less than three percent of total company sales 

  

raw material 

raw materials for our manufacturing operations primarily consisting of steel are generally available from several sources in adequate quantities a portion of our customers are contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in steel prices there has been significant volatility in steel costs over the last several years 

research and development 

to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin our global engineering center in nanjing china and at our operating locations total expenditures for research and development in 2012 2011 and 2010 were 517 million 427 million and 371 million respectively 

patents and trademarks 

we own and use in our businesses various trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and licenses we do not believe that our business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such trademark trade name patent trade secret or license however our trade name is important with respect to our products particularly in china india and the us 

employees 

our operations employed approximately 10900 employees as of december 31 2012 primarily nonunion 

backlog 

due to the shortcycle nature of our businesses none of our operations sustain significant backlogs

 item 1a – risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

 

 the global economy is still showing signs of stress and could stall or reverse the course of any recovery if this were to occur it could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition or slower adoption of energy efficient water heaters or boilers which could negatively impact our profitability andor cash flow in addition a deterioration in current economic conditions including credit market conditions could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials or increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our sales growth of a o smith branded products in china has averaged approximately 25 percent per year over the past five years and we anticipate growth of approximately 15 percent in 2013 in 2013 we will complete construction on a facility which will expand our manufacturing capacity by 50 percent if the chinese economy were to experience a significant slowdown or urbanization was to stall it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we introduced our 2015 financial aspirations in late 2012 we identified specific growth expectations for our a o smith branded products in china our us residential and commercial water heaters our lochinvar branded products our water treatment products and our products sold in india we identified earnings before interest and taxes ebit margin aspirations for our north america and rest of world segments we included assumptions for growth in revenues and earnings from acquisitions in our 2015 aspirations failure to profitably grow as expected or identify acquisition targets that meet our disciplined investment criteria could negatively impact our ability to achieve these aspirations failure to achieve one or more of these aforementioned growth factors could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

 the recovery in commercial construction activity in north america is fragile and commercial construction could decline again after showing small improvements in 2012 though we believe that the majority of the commercial business we serve is for replacement of existing products changes in the commercial construction market could affect us 

 

 net sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 36 percent of our 2012 net sales we expect that customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our dependence on sales from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products to our competitors the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or our inability to execute on pricing actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

 the compound annual growth rate of lochinvar’s revenues has been nine percent over the past five years largely due to the transition in the boiler industry from lower efficiency noncondensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers and lochinvar is a brand leader in residential and commercial condensing boilers in 2003 approximately five percent of the boilers sold in the us were condensing boilers and by 2011 the percentage had grown to approximately 30 percent we expect the transition to continue which would result in approximately ten percent growth in lochinvar branded sales in 2013 and for the foreseeable future after 2013 if the transition to higher efficiency condensing boilers stalls as a result of lower energy costs another recession occurs or our competitors’ technologies surpass our technology our growth rate could be lower than expected 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price we compete against manufacturers located primarily in north america and china some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing research and development and distribution resources than we have we cannot assure that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 product defects can occur through our own product development design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities we may incur various expenses related to product defects including product warranty costs product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs while we maintain a reserve for our product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve resulting in current period expenses and a need to increase our accruals for warranty charges in addition the reputation of our brand may be diminished by product defects and recalls further our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 acquisitions we have made have had a significant impact on our results of operations while we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and we intend to use a significant portion of our cash and marketable securities for future acquisitions we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms utilize cash flows from operations obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future if we complete any future acquisitions then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions if we complete any future acquisitions in new geographies our unfamiliarity with local regulations and market customs may impact our ability to operate them profitably or achieve our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing we cannot assure you that future acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our success may depend on our ability to adapt to technological changes in the water heating boiler and water treatment industry if we are unable to timely develop and introduce new products or enhance existing products in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or demands our competitiveness could be materially and adversely affected 

  

 our ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop acquire and retain necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success but cannot reasonably be assured 

 

 we depend on information technology to record and process customers’ orders manufacture and ship products in a timely manner and maintain the financial accuracy of our business records we are in the process of implementing a global enterprise resource planning erp system that will redesign and deploy new processes and a common information system across our plants over a period of several years there can be no certainty that this system will deliver the expected benefits the failure to achieve our goals may impact our ability to 1 process transactions accurately and efficiently and 2 remain in step with the changing needs of the trade which could result in the loss of customers in addition the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets 

 

 attracting and retaining talented employees is important to the continued success of our business failure to retain key personnel particularly on the leadership team would have a material effect on our business and our ability to execute our business strategies in a timely and effective manner 

 

 approximately 35 percent of our 2012 net sales were attributable to products manufactured and sold outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent in india approximately 6000 of our 10900 total employees as of december 31 2012 were located in china at december 31 2012 nearly 300 million of our cash and marketable securities balances were located in china in 2010 we opened a manufacturing plant in india international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade restrictions the impact of foreign government regulations the effects of income and withholding taxes governmental expropriation imposition or increase in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries labor relations problems the imposition of environmental or employment laws or other restrictions by foreign governments and differences in business practices we may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenue unfavorable changes in the political regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the us 

 

 we have significant operations outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent india and therefore hold assets incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars as a result we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates or hyperinflation in some foreign countries furthermore we typically price our products in our foreign operations in local currencies as a result an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our profitable foreign subsidiaries could have a negative effect on our profitability in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries’ functional currency these risks in north america and asia may hurt our ability to generate revenue and profits in those regions in the future or negatively impact revenues and earnings translated from foreign currencies into us dollars 

  

 due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a nonus government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws which are complex may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the market prices for certain raw materials we purchase primarily steel have been very volatile in the recent past significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in our ability to recover increased material costs from customers and that lag could negatively impact our profitability in addition in some cases we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components we require in the manufacture of our products a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 due to the significant negative investment returns in 2008 and falling interest rates in recent years the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately 187 million at december 31 2012 employees hired after january 1 2010 have not participated in our defined benefit plan and benefit accruals for the majority of current salaried and nonunion hourly employees will stop at the end of 2014 beginning in 2008 our minimum required pension contributions equal our target normal cost plus a seven year amortization of any funding shortfall offset by any employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa credit balance we are forecasting that there will be no required contributions to the plan in 2013 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions however we cannot provide any assurance that contributions will not be required in the future among the key assumptions inherent in our actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to making the contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing the company 

 

 our total assets include significant goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase prices we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at our businesses do not meet expectations we may be required to reflect a noncash charge to operating results for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairment the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets may affect our ability to maintain the debttocapital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

 our water heating boiler and water treatment products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture sale and use of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will be able to ultimately pay all insured losses in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements these include energy efficiency environmental emissions labeling and safetyrelated requirements while we believe our products are currently efficient safe and environmentfriendly a significant change to these regulatory requirements whether federal foreign state or local or otherwise to industry standards could substantially increase manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals known as conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries as a result in august 2012 the sec adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the drc and adjoining countries in their products these new requirements will require due diligence efforts in 2013 with initial disclosure requirements beginning in may 2014 there will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” conflict minerals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement

 item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a leading manufacturer of water heaters and boilers serving a diverse mix of residential and commercial end markets principally in the us with a strong and growing international presence during the fourth quarter of 2011 we reorganized our management reporting structure to reflect our current business activities historical information has been revised to reflect our new structure our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas gas tankless and electric water heaters both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective region of the world our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china india and europe the north america segment also manufactures and globally markets specialty commercial water heating equipment condensing and noncondensing boilers and water systems tanks the rest of world segment also manufactures and markets water treatment products primarily for asia on august 22 2011 we sold epc to rbc for approximately 760 million in cash and approximately 283 million shares of rbc common stock valued at 1406 million as of that date due to the sale epc has been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented in 2012 sales for our north america segment were 14308 million and sales for our rest of world segment were 5425 million 

sales of our rest of world a o smith branded products in china grew significantly in 2012 we expect sales of a o smith branded products in china to grow approximately 15 percent in 2013 as geographic expansion market share gains growth in water treatment and improved product mix due to new product introductions contribute to our growth although the residential and commercial replacement market contributed significantly to 2012 sales for our north america segment residential and commercial new construction remains fragile due to the relatively low number of housing starts and slight recovery of commercial construction activity our 2012 north america residential unit sales were essentially flat compared to the prior year and commercial unit sales showed midsingle digit growth we expect the north america residential water heater industry unit growth to be one to two percent for 2013 and we expect commercial industry units to be flat lochinvar branded products contributed approximately 226 million to our net sales in 2012 and we expect further sales growth of lochinvar branded products of approximately ten percent in 2013 driven by sales of energy efficient products 

we recognized a pretax charge of 354 million in 2010 for expenses related to damages to our water heater manufacturing facility located in ashland city tn caused by flooding of the cumberland river this facility was temporarily shut down and production of water heaters was temporarily transferred to our other water heater manufacturing facilities in the us canada and mexico our recovery from the impact of the flood was essentially completed by year end 2010 we lost some sales orders in 2010 due to the flood however we retained all customers from which we lost orders 

we purchased the remaining 20 percent interest in swt from the former owner in the fourth quarter of 2010 the progress of our water treatment business has been slower than anticipated due to a number of unforeseen challenges we incurred losses in 2012 2011 and 2010 we continue to expect strong long term sales growth opportunities in the water treatment market in china we introduced a o smith branded water treatment products into our china distribution network during 2010 and the products have been well received with sales more than doubling to greater than 20 million in 2012 

during 2010 we began production of residential water heaters for the indian market at our new plant located near bangalore india our sales in india increased 105 percent to 200 million dollars in 2012 

in 2010 we acquired the rights from takagi to market gas tankless water heaters in north america and entered into a longterm agreement with takagi to supply gas tankless water heaters as part of the venture we took over the management of takagi’s north american sales and distribution organization through this venture we offer a full line of gas tankless water heaters under our own brands in association with the takagi brand in 2012 we estimate the industry sold approximately 360000 gas tankless water heaters in north america down from approximately 420000 units in the prior year 

on october 11 2010 our board of directors declared a threefortwo stock split of our class a common stock and common stock in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend to stockholders of record on october 29 2010 and payable on november 15 2010 

we intend to take advantage of our strong balance sheet to execute on a number of our waterrelated strategic initiatives we will look to continue to grow our core residential and commercial water heating boiler and water treatment businesses in our existing operations in the high growth regions of china and india we will look to expand into additional fast growing 

  

markets via acquisition or via using our existing manufacturing locations in china and india as export platforms we intend to expand our core product lines in the areas of water heaters boilers and water treatment products through acquisitions joint ventures or other business relationships finally we intend to pursue opportunities in new and unique technologies as well as waterthemed adjacencies that will be attractive to our customers and channel partners and will leverage our core competencies to create shareholder value 

consistent with our stated strategy to expand our core product offering with new technologies on august 26 2011 we acquired lochinvar for a base price of approximately 421 million and we agreed to pay an earnout that resulted in a payment of 135 million to the former owners of lochinvar in december 2012 lochinvar one of the leading manufacturers of residential and commercial boilers in the us fit squarely within our stated strategic growth initiative to expand our core water heating business sales of lochinvar branded products in 2012 were approximately 226 million and have grown at a nine percent compound annual growth rate over the last five years the boiler market in the us has been transitioning to higher efficiency condensing boilers for the last several years in 2011 approximately 30 percent of boilers sold in the us were condensing boilers compared with five percent eight years ago our lochinvar brand is a leading brand of higher efficiency condensing boilers we expect the transition in the us to higher efficiency boilers will continue into the foreseeable future and as a result we expect sales of lochinvar branded products will likely continue to grow approximately ten percent in 2013 we paid for lochinvar using a combination of cash on hand and amounts that we borrowed under our credit facility 

results of operations 

our sales in 2012 were a record 19393 million surpassing 2011 sales from continuing operations of 17105 million by 134 percent the increase in sales was attributable mostly to sales of our lochinvar branded products we acquired lochinvar in august 2011 and sales of lochinvar branded products totaled 2257 million compared with 759 million in 2011 in addition higher sales of a o smith branded products in china grew 205 percent to 4483 million for the year our sales from continuing operations were 14893 million in 2010 the 2212 million increase in sales from 2010 to 2011 was due to the 759 million of sales added from our lochinvar acquisition and increased sales of a o smith branded products in china which grew by 290 percent or 838 million pricing actions related to higher material costs higher commercial water heater volumes and a full year of gas tankless products in north america also contributed to the increased sales in 2011 

our gross profit margin in 2012 increased to 336 percent from 300 percent for continuing operations in 2011 the impact of the addition of relatively higher margin sales of lochinvar branded products increased sales of a o smith branded products in china and lower manufacturing and warranty costs contributed to the higher margin in 2012 our gross profit margin in 2010 was 299 percent about equal to 2011 the impact of relatively higher margin sales of lochinvar branded products and increased sales of a o smith branded products in china in 2011 was offset by a decline in margin for water treatment products and higher material costs 

selling general and administrative expense sga was 777 million higher in 2012 than in 2011 the increase in sga was due to higher selling and advertising costs in support of increased volumes in china additional expenses from a full year of lochinvar operations and increased pension expense sga increased by 441 million from 2010 to 2011 resulting mostly from incremental selling costs to support higher volumes in china and 159 million of additional expenses from operations supporting lochinvar brands 

pension expense in 2012 was 138 million compared to 33 million and 105 million for continuing operations in 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase in pension expense in 2012 from 2011 was due to decreases in the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets the decrease in pension expense in 2011 from 2010 was due to earnings derived from 175 million of contributions made during 2011 

we purchased the remaining 20 percent interest in swt from the former owner in the fourth quarter of 2010 at the same time we also settled certain disputes with the former owner relative to the condition of swt on the date of purchase the settlement resulted in a 50 million nontaxable gain in 2010 additionally we incurred an impairment charge of 33 million related to the value of trademarks we received as part of the swt acquisition in 2010 we moved the water treatment operations to nanjing china to recognize synergies associated with our strong management team and the engineering center in place at our water heater operations in that city as a result of the move announced in 2010 we recorded 18 million in moving costs during the fourth quarter of 2010 the net impact of these transactions associated with our swt operation was 01 million of pretax expense for restructuring impairment and settlement income in 2010 

interest expense in 2012 was 92 million compared to interest expense for continuing operations of 93 million in 2011 interest expense in 2011 and 2010 is net of the amount allocated to discontinued operations interest expense that could not be attributed to specific entities within the company was allocated to epc based on the ratio of net assets to be sold to the sum of the consolidated net assets and debt exclusive of debt attributable to specific entities of the company the 24 million increase in continuing interest expense from 2010 to 2011 included 19 million associated with the debt incurred relative to the lochinvar acquisition with the remainder of the increase being attributable to higher interest rates 

  

other income of 343 million in 2012 was comprised of 272 million pretax gains on the sale of shares of rbc common stock received from the sale of epc net of the impact of the rbc share collar with most of the remainder of 2012 net other income resulting from interest income on investments resulting from the sale of epc net other income was 198 million in 2011 we received approximately 283 million shares of rbc common stock as part of the proceeds for the sale of epc on august 22 2011 under an agreement that we executed in december 2010 the rbc share price appreciated in the first quarter of 2011 during which we entered into an equity collar contract for 50 percent of the shares that we expected to receive to protect a portion of the appreciation the put strike price of the equity collar was 6329 and the call strike price of the collar was 7732 the rbc share price on december 31 2011 was 5097 the collar did not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore was adjusted to fair value through earnings from continuing operations at the end of 2011 the contract was marked to market under accounting rules resulting in a 179 million pretax gain during 2011 the market price of the shares of rbc common stock we received increased by 136 per share from the date of the sale of epc until the end of 2011 resulting in a 19 million pretax gain on the 50 percent of shares covered by the collar contract the resulting net gain on shares of rbc common stock activity of 198 million in 2011 was recorded in other income from continuing operations 

our effective tax rate was 304 percent in 2012 compared with 311 percent and 233 percent for continuing operations in 2011 and 2010 respectively the rate decline in 2012 from 2011 was due to larger than anticipated tax deductions resulting from our domestic production activities deduction the relatively low effective tax rate in 2010 was due to lower domestic earnings as a result of 354 million pretax flood related expense as well as higher 2010 foreign earnings which were in lower tax jurisdictions 

we achieved net earnings inclusive of discontinued operations and noncontrolling interest of 1587 million or 341 per diluted share in 2012 compared with 3057 million or 657 per diluted share in 2011 and 1117 million or 242 per diluted share in 2010 our 2012 earnings include discontinued operations aftertax losses of 39 million or 08 per diluted share related to the sale of epc which occurred in 2011 included in discontinued operations was 64 million of expense representing the correction of an error primarily due to our calculation of taxes due upon repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings additionally in continuing operations we recorded aftertax gains totaling 217 million or 46 per diluted share associated with the sale of our shares of rbc common stock a legal settlement with a component supplier for our canadian operations and the revisions to our estimate of the lochinvar earnout obligation our 2011 earnings include 1945 million or 418 per diluted share related to epc as well as an aftertax gain of 129 million or 28 per diluted share associated with our shares of rbc common stock a legal settlement with a component supplier for our us operations and an increase to a warranty reserve associated with the canadian component supplier our 2010 earnings include an aftertax 216 million or 047 per diluted share charge for the flood of our ashland city tn water heater plant in may 2010 as well as 544 million or 118 per diluted share from epc 

north america 

sales for our north america segment were 14308 million in 2012 or 1413 million higher than sales of 12895 million in 2011 the sales increase in 2012 included 1429 million of incremental sales from lochinvar branded products resulting from our acquisition of lochinvar completed on august 26 2011 we also experienced higher volumes of us residential and commercial water heaters which were offset by lower gas tankless and canadian water heater volumes our north america sales of 12895 million in 2011 were 1341 million higher than sales of 11554 million in 2010 the sales increase in 2011 included 759 million of sales of lochinvar branded products our commercial water heater volumes were also higher in 2011 in advance of a regulatory change in southern california a material related price increase effective in april 2011 and a full year of sales of gas tankless products also contributed to increased sales in 2011 

operating earnings for north america were 1998 million in 2012 or 458 million higher than operating earnings of 1540 million in 2011 our lochinvar acquisition added 371 million of incremental operating earnings in 2012 higher us residential and commercial volumes also contributed to the increase in 2012 earnings also included in 2012 is a 39 million pretax gain from a settlement with a component supplier for our canadian operations which is reflected in the “restructuring impairment and settlement income expensenet” line in the accompanying financial statements this segment’s 2012 operating earnings also include a net 33 million favorable pretax adjustment to the estimate of contingent consideration due to the former owners of lochinvar the acquisition agreement contemplated contingent consideration based on achieving a specified level of sales of lochinvar branded products from december 1 2011 through november 30 2012 and the fair value of the contingent payment was estimated to be 168 million at the closing of the acquisition based on a forecasted 16 percent increase in sales the actual 15 percent sales increase resulted in a net 33 million pretax gain in 2012 from the decrease in the contingent payment this earnout adjustment is reflected as “contingent consideration adjustment” in the accompanying financial statements 

  

operating earnings for north america were 1540 million in 2011 or 628 million higher than earnings of 912 million in 2010 operating earnings in 2010 were adversely impacted by a pretax charge of 354 million for flood damage to our water heater manufacturing facility located in ashland city tn in may 2010 this facility was temporarily shut down and production of water heaters was transferred to our other water heater manufacturing facilities in the us canada and mexico the total direct cost for the flood damage was 673 million and included repair of buildings and equipment site cleanup and restoration and writeoff of inventory and fixed assets insurance proceeds totaled 319 million resulting in a net charge for direct flood expenses of 354 million additional detail is provided in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements also included in 2011 was an 112 million pretax gain for recovery of costs and damages associated with a legal settlement relating to an issue with a component part supplied by one of our vendors for our us operations this gain is reflected in the “restructuring impairment and settlement income expensenet” line in the accompanying financial statements the 112 million gain was partially offset by 82 million of product warranty expense associated with a similar component issue for our canadian operations and recorded as cost of products sold in 2011 the increased operating earnings in 2011 when compared to 2010 excluding the above items were due primarily to 131 million of operating earnings contributed by our lochinvar acquisition 

rest of world 

sales for our rest of world segment in 2012 were 5425 million or 869 million higher than sales of 4556 million in 2011 due to a higher priced product mix in the region as a result of product innovations with more robust features and benefits as well as pricing actions market share gains derived from sales of a o smith branded products in china grew by 766 million and sales for our nona o smith branded water treatment business increased by 38 million in 2012 rest of world sales in 2011 were 867 million higher than sales of 3689 million in 2010 a o smith branded products sales in china grew by 838 million and sales in india more than doubled to 181 million in 2011 sales for our water treatment business were 130 million lower in 2011 than 2010 primarily due to inefficiencies as a result of moving our swt manufacturing facility 

rest of world operating earnings were 596 million in 2012 compared to 2011 earnings of 427 million the 169 million increase in earnings in 2012 was driven by higher volumes of a o smith branded products in china and reduced losses of 32 million for the nona o smith branded water treatment business which was partially offset by larger losses in india due to new product introduction costs and brand building expenses in the region rest of world operating earnings were 424 million in 2010 increased earnings in 2011 for our a o smith branded products in china were offset by losses at swt of 106 million in 2011 compared to losses of 32 million in 2010 

the operating margins for our rest of world segment were 110 percent 94 percent and 115 percent in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the increased margin in 2012 was favorably impacted by increased volumes of a o smith branded products in china the 2011 margin was impacted by losses at swt resulting from lower sales and costs associated with moving to a new manufacturing facility in 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital was 6113 million at december 31 2012 compared with 7279 million and 2095 million at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively the 1166 million decline in working capital in 2012 was primarily due to the sale of our shares of rbc common stock which were received as a result of our divestiture of epc the proceeds from the sale were used to repay debt the sale of the shares more than offset a 570 million salesrelated increase in accounts receivable the majority of the 5184 million increase in working capital in 2011 was due to the receipt of cash and shares of rbc common stock from the sale of epc which closed in the third quarter less the cash used in the acquisition of lochinvar and to a lesser extent the increase in working capital related to the purchase of lochinvar as of december 31 2012 4571 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries the company would incur a cost to repatriate these funds to the us and has accrued 651 million for the repatriation of these funds 

operating cash provided by continuing operations during 2012 was 1712 million compared with 610 million during 2011 and 633 million during 2010 the improvement in cash flow in 2012 was primarily related to higher earnings and the impact in 2011 of pretax pension contributions of approximately 175 million partially offset by higher working capital requirements higher earnings in 2011 and improved working capital were more than offset by 175 million of pretax pension contributions resulting in lower operating cash flows in 2011 than in 2010 we expect cash provided by operating activities in 2013 to be between 200 and 220 million 

our capital expenditures for continuing operations were 699 million in 2012 535 million in 2011 and 535 million in 2010 capital expenditures in 2012 were higher than in 2011 as a result of construction activity for a second water heater manufacturing plant in nanjing china to meet local demand the new plant is expected to add 50 percent more capacity to our china water heater operations and to come on line in mid2013 in 2012 we also began construction to expand our india plant to accommodate more water heater models insource some component manufacturing and meet local demand we are 

  

projecting 2013 capital expenditures of between 80 and 90 million and 2013 depreciation and amortization of between 55 and 60 million we expect capital spending in 2013 to include approximately 40 million to continue the construction of the new manufacturing plant in china and complete the plant expansion in india 

in december 2012 we completed a 400 million multicurrency five year revolving credit facility with a group of eight banks the facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to 500 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31 2012 

the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings and it expires on december 12 2017 as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt at december 31 2012 we had available borrowing capacity of 2363 million under this facility we believe that the combination of cash available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

our total debt declined to 2437 million at december 31 2012 compared with 4616 million at december 31 2011 due to the sale of our shares of rbc common stock and cash flow generated in the us as a result our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 169 percent at the end of 2012 compared with 298 percent at the end of 2011 

our us pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations we were not required to make a contribution to our pension plan in 2012 and we did not make any voluntary contributions we are forecasting that there will be no required contributions to the plan in 2013 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions for further information on our pension plans see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in december 2010 our board of directors ratified its authorization of a stock repurchase program in the amount of 15 million shares of our common stock during 2012 we repurchased 426490 shares at an average price of 5160 per share for a total amount of 220 million as of december 31 2012 a total of 461921 shares remained in the existing repurchase authority 

we have paid dividends for 73 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 21 years we paid total dividends of 72 per share in 2012 compared with 60 per share in 2011 

discontinued operations financial information is provided in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 is as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2012 our liability for uncertain income tax positions was 13 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to our scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments that we consider firm 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201108 “testing of goodwill for impairment topic 350” asu no 201108 allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test needs to be performed under the option an entity no longer would be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 

  

unless it determines based on that qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount the asu may change how a company tests goodwill for impairment but should not change the timing or measurement of goodwill impairments asu 201108 will be effective for the year ending december 31 2012 adoption of this asu did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in july 2012 the fasb issued asu 201202 “testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment” asu 201202 allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether events and circumstances indicate that it is morelikelythan not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if an entity determines that it is not morelikelythan not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is not required to perform a quantitative impairment test asu 201202 will be effective for the year ending december 31 2013 adoption of this asu will not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we constantly reevaluate these significant factors and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an armslength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct annual thorough and competent valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment in goodwill in 2012 however in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a 33 million impairment charge for trademarks recorded as part of the swt acquisition 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed on a periodic basis at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year in 2012 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million per occurrence 

  

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also use an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time at december 31 2012 our reserve for product liability was 385 million 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected rate of return on plan assets was 850 percent in 2012 compared to 875 percent in 2011 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs decreased to 490 percent in 2012 from 535 percent in 2011 in 2013 the forecasted rate of return on plan assets is 800 percent and the discount rate is 405 percent 

in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluate our pension plan’s current and target asset allocation the expected longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is approximately 60 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2012 was 62 percent to equity managers 33 percent to bond managers four percent to private equity managers and the remainder in money market instruments we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical tenyear and 25year compounded annualized returns are 76 percent and 98 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the expected longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 800 percent expected return on assets for 2013 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2012 and 2011 were based on the aon hewitt aa only above median yield curve which was designed by aon hewitt to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the aa only above median curve represents a series of annual discount rates from bonds with aa minimum average rating as rated by moody’s investor service moody’s standard  poor’s sp and fitch the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2010 were based on the hewitt top quartile yield curve htq the htq was a hypothetical double a yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates each bond issue underlying the htq was required to have a rating of aa or better by moody’s or a rating of aa or better by sp aon hewitt no longer supports the previous yield curve model and the aa only above median yield curve closely follows the previous yield curve we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

we estimate that we will recognize approximately 276 million of pension expense in 2013 compared to 138 million in 2012 a majority of the increase in 2013 expense is due to the decrease in both the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2013 by approximately 19 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2013 net pension expense by approximately 10 million 

in future filings we will also present adjusted earnings adjusted earnings per share eps and adjusted segment operating earnings which exclude nonoperating related pension costs of the company’s pension plan comprised of interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of actuarial gains losses and curtailment and other onetime charges the service cost and amortization of prior service cost components of our pension plan will be included in adjusted earnings adjusted eps and adjusted segment operating earnings we believe that these components of pension cost better reflect ongoing operating related costs of providing pension benefits to the company’s employees in addition we have made changes to our pension plan including closing the plan to new entrants effective january 1 2010 and freezing the plan for the majority of our existing participants effective january 1 2015 which we believe will significantly decrease pension expense beginning in 2015 as such we believe that the measures of adjusted earnings adjusted eps and adjusted segment operating earnings provide management and investors with a useful measure of our operational results other components of gaap pension cost are mainly driven by market performance and the company manages these separately from the operational performance of its businesses we have prepared quarterly and annual reconciliations of adjusted earnings adjusted eps and adjusted segment operating earnings and an annual schedule of components of pension expense for the years 20102012 which are provided in the supplemental financial data document posted in the investor relations section on our website 

  

the following is a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations gaap to diluted adjusted eps from continuing operations nongaap 

 

 outlook 

with our strong north american replacement water heater business growing lochinvar branded boiler platform and expanding global presence particularly in china we believe we are well positioned entering 2013 we believe business conditions are continuing to improve modestly in the us and we remain optimistic the growth exhibited by the housing market last year will carry over into this year as well for 2013 we expect to achieve fullyear gaap earnings of between 300 and 320 per diluted share and adjusted earnings of between 325 and 345 per diluted share both of which exclude the potential impact from future acquisitions 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal foreign state local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2012 and are not expected to be material in any single year we have accrued amounts associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2012 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 766 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 77 million gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2012 we had 1637 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 14 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 02 million

rest of world 

sales in our rest of world segment increased 235 percent or 867 million compared with the prior year a 290 percent increase in sales of a o smith branded products in china to 3717 million was the primary source of the increase in sales 

we entered the chinese water heater market through a joint venture in 1995 buying out our partner three years later since that time we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building a o smith brand recognition in the chinese residential and commercial markets we believe we are one of the leading suppliers of water heaters to the residential market in china with a broad product offering including electric gas tankless heat pump and solar units

 item 1a – risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

  

 the global credit and capital markets are still showing signs of stress and threaten to stall or reverse the course of any recovery if this were to occur it could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition or slower adoption of energy efficient water heaters or boilers which could negatively impact our profitability andor cash flow in addition a deterioration in current economic conditions including the credit market conditions could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials or increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 commercial construction activity could continue the decline that began in the second half of 2008 and declined further in 2009 and 2010 before leveling off in 2011 though we believe that the majority of the commercial business we serve is for replacement we could also be affected by changes in the commercial construction market 

 

 approximately 78 percent of our growth over the past five years has occurred in china in 2012 we are commencing construction on a facility which will expand our manufacturing capacity by 50 percent if the chinese economy were to experience a significant slowdown it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 net sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 38 percent of our 2011 net sales from continuing operations we expect that customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our dependence on sales from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products to our competitors the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or our inability to execute on pricing actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the compound annual growth rate of lochinvar’s revenues has been eight percent over the past five years largely due to the transition in the boiler industry from lower efficiency noncondensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers and lochinvar is a leading residential and commercial condensing boiler company in 2003 approximately five percent of the boilers sold in the us were condensing boilers and by 2010 the percentage had grown to approximately 25 percent we expect the transition to continue which would result in greater than ten percent growth in lochinvar’s sales in 2012 and greater than eight percent growth in lochinvar sales for the foreseeable future after 2012 if the transition to higher efficiency condensing boilers stalls as a result of lower energy costs another recession occurs or our competitors’ technologies surpassing lochinvar’s our growth rate could be lower than expected in addition we have stated that we expect to achieve synergies from the lochinvar acquisition of 10 to 15 million in the next several years if our growth rate slows or our synergies fail to materialize our stated accretion from the lochinvar acquisition in 2012 of 40 to 50 per share could be materially impacted 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price we compete against manufacturers located primarily in north america and china some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing research and development and distribution resources than we have we cannot assure that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 approximately 35 percent of our 2011 net sales was attributable to products manufactured and sold outside of the us principally in china approximately 5800 of our 10600 total employees as of december 31 2011 were located in china at december 31 2011 nearly 300 million of our cash balances were located in china in 2010 we opened a manufacturing plant in india international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade restrictions the impact of foreign government regulations the effects of income and withholding taxes governmental expropriation imposition or increase in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries labor relations problems the imposition of environmental or employment laws or other restrictions by foreign governments and differences in business practices we may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenue unfavorable changes in the political regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the us 

 

 we have significant operations outside of the us primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent india and mexico and therefore hold assets incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u s dollar the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars as a result we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates or hyperinflation in some foreign countries furthermore we typically price our products in our foreign operations in local currencies as a result an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our profitable foreign subsidiaries could have a negative effect on our profitability in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries’ functional currency the above mentioned risks in north america and asia may hurt our ability to generate revenue and profits in those regions in the future 

 

 due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a nonus government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws which are complex may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the market prices for certain raw materials we purchase primarily steel have been very volatile in the recent past significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in our ability to recover increased material costs from customers and that lag could negatively impact our profitability in addition in some cases we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components required in the manufacture of our product a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 product defects can occur through our own product development design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities we may incur various expenses related to product defects including product warranty costs product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs while we maintain a reserve for our product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve resulting in current period expenses and a need to increase our accruals for warranty charges in 

  

addition the reputation of our brand may be diminished by product defects and recalls further our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 due to the significant negative investment returns in 2008 and falling interest rates in recent years the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately 138 million at december 31 2011 beginning in 2008 our minimum required pension contributions equal our target normal cost plus a seven year amortization of any funding shortfall offset by any employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa credit balance we are forecasting that there will be no required contributions to the plan in 2012 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions however we cannot provide any assurance that contributions will not be required in the future among the key assumptions inherent in our actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to making the contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing the company 

 

 our total assets include significant goodwill our goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase prices we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at our businesses do not meet expectations we may be required to reflect a noncash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the affect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill may affect our ability to maintain the debttocapital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 we purchased 80 percent of the water treatment business of tianlong in november 2009 and purchased the remaining 20 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 we are operating the business as swt the successful operation of swt will require substantial attention from our management which could decrease the time our management has to serve and attract customers we cannot provide assurance that this acquisition will operate profitably or that it will be able to achieve the financial or operational success we expect from the acquisition the progress of our water treatment business has been slower than anticipated due to a number of unforeseen challenges including lower than anticipated sales and the need to move the manufacturing facility sooner than planned our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected if our other businesses suffer on account of the increased focus on the acquired business 

 

 acquisitions we have made over the last several years have had a significant impact on our results of operations while we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and we intend to use a portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of epc for future acquisitions we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms utilize cash flows from operations obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future if we complete any future acquisitions then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing we cannot assure you that future acquisitions will not have a material adverse affect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 in addition to cash proceeds of approximately 760 million from the sale of epc to rbc we received approximately 283 million shares of rbc common stock in 2011 we entered into an equity collar contract for 50 percent of the shares to protect a portion of the value of the stock we are exposed to market fluctuations for the remaining 50 percent of the unhedged rbc shares we do not intend to be longterm shareholders of rbc and a decline in the market value of rbc shares prior to our sale of these shares could have a material adverse impact on the value of our holdings 

 

 our water heating and boiler products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture sale and use of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will successfully weather the current economic downturn in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements these include energy efficiency climate emissions labeling and safetyrelated requirements while we believe our products are currently some of the most efficient safest and environmentfriendly products available a significant change to these regulatory requirements whether federal foreign state or local or otherwise to industry standards could substantially increase manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 our success may depend on our ability to adapt to technological changes in the water heating boiler and water treatment industry if we are unable to timely develop and introduce new products or enhance existing products in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or demands our competitiveness could be materially and adversely affected 

 

 we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock currently are entitled as a class to elect only onethird of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit smith family have entered into a voting trust agreement with respect to shares of our class a common stock and shares of our common stock they own as of december 31 2011 these members of the smith family own approximately 574 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and common stock taken together as a single class and approximately 871 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock as a separate class due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and shares of our class a common stock the smith family is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control this ownership position may increase if other members of the smith family enter into the voting trust agreement and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our class a common stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our common stock the voting trust agreement provides that in the event one of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our class a common stock such shares of our class a common stock are automatically exchanged for shares of our common stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust in addition the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our class a common stock and our common stock proposed to be withdrawn or transferred from the trust as a result the smith family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the smith family decide to transfer their shares

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a leading manufacturer of water heaters and boilers serving a diverse mix of residential and commercial end markets principally in the us with a strong and growing international presence during the fourth quarter of 2011 we reorganized our management reporting structure to reflect our current business activities historical information has been revised to reflect our new structure our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas gas tankless oil and electric water heaters both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective region of the world the north america segment also manufactures and globally markets specialty commercial water heating equipment condensing and noncondensing boilers and water systems tanks the rest of world segment also manufactures and markets water treatment products primarily for asia on august 22 2011 we sold epc to rbc for approximately 760 million in cash and approximately 283 million shares of rbc common stock valued at 1406 million as of that date due to the sale epc has been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented in 2011 sales for our north america segment were 12895 million sales for our rest of world segment were 4556 million and discontinued operations epc sales were 5318 million 

sales of our rest of world a o smith branded products in china grew significantly in 2011 we expect sales of a o smith branded products in china to grow approximately twice as fast as the rate of china’s gross domestic product gdp in 2012 as geographic expansion market share gains and new product introductions contribute to our growth the residential and commercial markets for our north america segment remain weak due to the relatively low number of housing starts and lack of commercial construction activity although residential and commercial replacement demand significantly supported our sales in 2011 our 2011 north america residential sales were essentially flat compared to the prior year and commercial sales showed slight growth largely in anticipation of a regulatory change in 2012 we expect the north america residential water heater industry unit growth to be flat for 2012 and expect a modest decline in commercial industry units our recently acquired residential and commercial boiler operations more completely described below added approximately 76 million to our north america sales in 2011 and we expect this business to grow over ten percent in 2012 driven by sales of energy efficient products 

we recognized a pretax charge of 354 million in 2010 for expenses related to damages to our water heater manufacturing facility located in ashland city tn caused by flooding of the cumberland river this facility was temporarily shut down and production of water heaters was transferred to our other water heater manufacturing facilities in the us canada and mexico our recovery from the impact of the flood was essentially completed by year end 2010 we lost some sales orders in 2010 due to the flood however we retained all customers from which we lost orders 

we purchased the remaining 20 percent interest in swt from our former partner in the fourth quarter of 2010 and now own 100 percent of this company the progress of our water treatment business has been slower than anticipated due to a number of unforeseen challenges including the need to move the manufacturing facility sooner than planned we incurred losses in 2011 and in 2010 we continue to expect strong long term sales growth opportunities in the water treatment industry in china we introduced a o smith branded water treatment products into our china distribution network during 2010 and now sell these products in over 900 outlets 

during the second quarter of 2010 we began production of residential water heaters for the indian market at our new plant located just outside of bangalore india in 2011 sales in our india water heater operations more than doubled to 181 million compared to the prior year 

on july 1 2010 we acquired the rights from takagi to market tankless water heaters in north america and entered into a longterm agreement with takagi to supply tankless water heaters as part of the venture we took over the management of takagi’s north american sales and distribution organization through this venture we offer a full line of gas tankless water heaters under our own brands in association with the takagi brand in 2011 we estimate the industry sold approximately 440000 tankless water heaters in north america 

on october 11 2010 our board of directors declared a threefortwo stock split of our class a common stock and common stock in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend to stock holders of record on october 29 2010 and payable on november 15 2010 

we intend to take advantage of our strong balance sheet and the remaining proceeds from the sale of epc to execute on a number of our water related strategic initiatives we will look to continue to grow our core residential and commercial water heating boiler and water treatment businesses in our existing operations in the high growth regions of china and india we will look to expand into additional fast growing geographic markets such as south america southeast asia and africa via acquisition or via using our existing manufacturing locations in china and india as export platforms 

  

we intend to expand our core product lines in the areas of water heaters boilers and water treatment products through acquisitions joint ventures or other business relationships finally we will pursue opportunities in new and unique technologies as well as water themed adjacencies that will be attractive to our customers and channel partners and will leverage our core competencies to create shareholder value 

consistent with our stated strategy to expand our core product offering with new technologies on august 26 2011 we acquired lochinvar for approximately 421 million plus an earnout of up to 35 million if certain revenue objectives are achieved by november 2012 lochinvar one of the leading manufacturers of residential and commercial boilers in the us fits squarely within our stated strategic growth initiative to expand our core water heating business lochinvar’s sales for the twelve months ended november 30 2011 lochinvar’s former fiscal year end were approximately 200 million and have grown at an eight percent compound annual growth rate over the last five years the boiler market in the us has been transitioning to higher efficiency condensing boilers for the last several years in 2010 about 25 percent of boilers sold in the us were condensing boilers compared with five percent eight years ago lochinvar is a leading manufacturer of condensing boilers as well as an innovator of new higher efficiency boilers we expect the transition in the us to higher efficiency boilers will continue into the foreseeable future and as a result we expect sales of lochinvar’s products will likely continue to grow more than ten percent in 2012 we paid the purchase price for lochinvar using a combination of cash on hand and amounts that we borrowed under our 425 million credit facility 

liquidity and capital resources 

we achieved net earnings inclusive of discontinued operations and noncontrolling interest of 3057 million or 657 per diluted share in 2011 compared with 1117 million or 242 per diluted share in 2010 and 813 million or 236 per diluted share in 2009 our 2011 earnings include 1945 million or 418 per diluted share related to epc as well as an aftertax gain of 129 million or 28 per diluted share associated with our shares of rbc a legal settlement with a component supplier and an increase to a warranty reserve associated with a similar component in canada our newly acquired lochinvar business contributed 07 per diluted share to full year earnings which included interest expense and 10 per diluted share of nonrecurring professional fees and purchase accounting charges our 2010 earnings include an aftertax 216 million or 047 per diluted share charge for the flooding of our ashland city tn water heater plant in may 2010 as well as 544 million or 118 per diluted share from epc our 2009 reported earnings and earnings per share include 291 million or 88 per diluted share from epc and have been impacted by required accounting related to our transaction with smith investment company sico which closed on april 22 2009 and is discussed in more detail in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for accounting purposes the former controlling shareholder sico is treated as the acquirer even though we a o smith corporation are the surviving corporation from a legal standpoint earnings and earnings per share amounts reported by us for 2009 include sico earnings and shares outstanding as adjusted for the exchange ratio of the merger transaction prior to the closing date 

the primary accounting impact of the sico transaction is in the calculation of earnings per share because the accounting rules require the use of sico adjusted average shares outstanding prior to closing the sico transaction did not impact 2011 or 2010 results eliminating the impact of the transaction as set forth in the table below non generally accepted accounting principles gaap net earnings including net earnings from discontinued operations in 2009 were 897 million or 197 per diluted share 

we believe that presenting nongaap financial information permits investors to compare our financial results for the current period to our historical results for the periods reported although 2011 and 2010 financial information was not affected by the transaction 2009 full year and previously reported periods were impacted management also uses the nongaap information for all internal purposes of reporting results of operations including return on investment measures utilized in determining certain incentivebased compensation and employee profit sharing amounts below is a reconciliation of gaap to nongaap earnings and earnings per share as discussed above 

  

a o smith corporation 

reconciliation of nongaap data 

in millions except per share amounts 

 

 although 2011 and 2010 financial information was not affected by the transaction 2009 full year and previously reported periods were impacted the nongaap presentation of adjusted earnings per share should not be construed as an alternative to the results reported in accordance with us gaap it is provided solely to assist in the investor’s understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the company’s operations 

 

 our results of continuing operations will be discussed later in this section and our discontinued operation’s financial information is provided in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our working capital was 7203 million at december 31 2011 compared with 2095 million and 1217 million at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively the majority of the 5108 million increase in working capital in 2011 was due to the receipt of cash and rbc shares from the sale of epc which closed in the third quarter less the cash used in the acquisition of lochinvar and to a lesser extent the working capital related to the purchase of lochinvar the 878 million increase in working capital in 2010 resulted from higher cash levels outside the us sales related increases late in the year in accounts receivable and higher inventory levels to support higher sales new businesses and new product launches which were partially offset by higher accounts payable balances related to higher sales as of december 31 2011 4633 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries 

operating cash provided by continuing operations during 2011 was 610 million compared with 633 million during 2010 and 1229 million during 2009 higher earnings in 2011 and improved working capital were more than offset by 107 million of after tax pension contributions resulting in lower operating cash flows in 2011 than in 2010 the increase in our working capital needs in 2010 compared with a decline in the previous year explain the majority of the decline in 2010 operating cash flows as compared with 2009 we expect our cash provided by operating activities less the expected earnout related to lochinvar in 2012 to be approximately 145 to 155 million an improvement from 2011 primarily due to the expected absence of pension contributions 

  

our capital expenditures for continuing operations were 535 million in 2011 the same as in 2010 capital expenditures in 2010 were higher than the 427 million spent in 2009 as a result of 185 million in capital spending related to the flooding in may 2010 we are projecting 2012 capital expenditures of between 80 and 90 million and 2012 depreciation and amortization of approximately 55 million capital spending in 2012 will include approximately 40 million to begin construction of a second water heater manufacturing plant in nanjing china to meet local demand the new plant is expected to add 50 percent more capacity to our china water heater operations we also plan to expand our india plant to accommodate more water heater models insource some component manufacturing and meet local demand we expect our 2012 depreciation and amortization will be approximately 8 million higher than 2011 primarily related to lochinvar 

in november 2010 we completed a 425 million multicurrency three year revolving credit facility with a group of eight banks the facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to 525 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31 2011 

the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings and it expires on november 12 2013 as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt at december 31 2011 we had available borrowing capacity of 611 million under this facility in addition the value of our rbc shares as of december 31 2011 was 1444 million and we do not intend to be longterm shareholders of rbc we believe that the combination of cash available borrowing capacity proceeds from the sale of rbc shares and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

our total debt increased to 4616 million at december 31 2011 compared with 2610 million at december 31 2010 due to the purchase of lochinvar as a result our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 298 percent at the end of 2011 compared with 228 percent at the end of 2010 

our us pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations while we were required to make a minimal contribution to the plan in 2011 we elected to make contributions of 1750 million we are forecasting that there will be no required contributions to the plan in 2012 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions for further information on our pension plans see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in december 2010 our board of directors ratified its authorization of a stock repurchase program in the amount of 15 million shares of our common stock during 2011 we repurchased approximately 612000 shares at an average price of 3869 per share for a total amount of 235 million a total of approximately 888000 remain in the existing repurchase authority 

we have paid dividends for 72 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 20 years we paid total dividends of 60 per share in 2011 compared with 54 per share in 2010 

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 is as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2011 our liability for uncertain income tax positions was 18 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to our scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments that we consider firm 

  

results of operations 

our sales from continuing operations in 2011 were 17105 million surpassing 2010 sales of 14893 million by 149 percent the increase in sales was attributable mostly to our recently acquired lochinvar business which added 759 million in sales and higher sales of a o smith branded products in china which grew 290 percent to 3717 million for the year pricing actions related to higher raw material costs higher commercial water heater volumes and a full year of sales of gas tankless products in north america also contributed to the increased sales our sales from continuing operations were 13750 million in 2009 the 1143 million increase in sales from 2009 to 2010 was due to higher sales in china resulting from geographic expansion market share gains and new product introductions as well as additional sales from our water treatment business acquired in november of 2009 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we evaluated our segment reporting subsequent to the sale of epc and the purchase of lochinvar and reorganized our management reporting structure to reflect our current business activities and concluded that reporting two geographic segments would more closely align our financial reporting with how we manage our overall business commencing with this annual report on form 10k our company is comprised of two reporting segments north america and rest of world sales and earnings results for these new reporting segments are discussed later in the results of operations and have been restated for all periods presented 

our gross profit margin for continuing operations in 2011 was 300 percent about equal to the 299 percent margin in 2010 the impact of the addition of relatively higher margin sales from our lochinvar acquisition and increased sales of a o smith branded products in china in 2011 was offset by a decline in margin in our water treatment products and higher material costs our gross profit margin increased from 287 percent in 2009 to 299 percent in 2010 the improved margins were due to increased volume cost containment activities and lower warranty costs which more than offset certain inefficiencies resulting from the may 2010 flood in our ashland tn manufacturing facility 

selling general and administrative expense sga was 441 million higher in 2011 than in 2010 the increase in sga in 2011 was due to higher selling and advertising costs in support of increased volumes in china and 159 million of additional expenses from lochinvar operations sga increased by 369 million from 2009 to 2010 resulting mostly from incremental selling costs to support higher volumes and new product lines in china 

pension expense for continuing operations in 2011 was 33 million compared to 105 million in 2010 and 88 million in 2009 the decrease in pension expense in 2011 from 2010 was due to 175 million of contributions made during 2011 the increase in pension expense in 2010 from 2009 was due to a decrease in the discount rate and increased amortization of deferred asset losses 

we purchased the remaining 20 percent interest in swt from our former partner in the fourth quarter of 2010 and own 100 percent of this water treatment company at the same time we also settled certain disputes with our former partner relative to the condition of swt on the date of purchase the settlement resulted in a 50 million nontaxable gain additionally we incurred an impairment charge of 33 million related to the value of trademarks we received as part of the swt acquisition we also moved the water treatment operations to nanjing china to recognize synergies associated with our strong management team and the engineering center in place at our water heater operations in that city as a result of the announced move in 2010 we recorded 18 million in moving costs during the fourth quarter of 2010 the net impact of the aforementioned transactions associated with our swt operation was a 1 million pretax expense for restructuring impairment and settlement income in 2010 corporate expense in 2009 included 13 million of restructuring charges the majority of which were associated with the loss on sale of a vacated facility from a previously owned business 

interest expense net of the amount allocated to discontinued operations was 93 million 69 million and 72 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively interest expense that could not be attributed to specific entities within the company was allocated to epc based on the ratio of net assets to be sold to the sum of consolidated net assets and debt exclusive of debt attributable to specific entities of the company the 24 million increase in continuing interest expense from 2010 to 2011 included 19 million associated with the debt incurred relative to the lochinvar acquisition with the remainder of the increase being attributable to higher interest rates the decline in continuing interest expense in 2010 from 2009 was due to lower debt levels 

net other income was 198 million in 2011 and compared to net other expense of 5 million and 28 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively we closed on the sale of epc to rbc on august 22 2011 and received approximately 283 million rbc common shares as part of the sale proceeds the rbc share price appreciated in the first quarter of 2011 during which we entered into an equity collar contract for 50 percent of the shares to protect a portion of the appreciation the put strike price of the equity collar is 6329 and the call strike price of the collar is 7732 the rbc share price on december 31 2011 was 5097 the collar did not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore is adjusted to fair value on a quarterly basis through earnings from continuing operations the company is required to make cash or stock deposits on unrealized losses on the 

  

equity collar that exceed 250 million the mark to market accounting for the rbc shares and hedge will continue until the equity collar contract expires in march 2012 at the end of 2011 the contract was marked to market under accounting rules resulting in a 179 million pretax gain during 2011 the market price of the rbc shares we received increased by 136 per share from the date of the sale of epc until the end of 2011 resulting in a 19 million pretax gain on the 50 percent of shares covered by the collar contract the resulting net gain on rbc shares activity of 198 million in 2011 was recorded in other income from continuing operations the unrealized gain on the rbc shares not covered by the contract was reflected on an aftertax basis in other comprehensive income the decline in other expense in 2010 from 2009 was due to a 24 million gain on the sale of a vacant parcel of land adjacent to our ashland city tn facility in 2010 

our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 311 percent in 2011 233 percent in 2010 and 337 percent in 2009 the relatively low effective tax rate in 2010 was due to lower domestic earnings as a result of the 354 million pretax flood related expense as well as higher 2010 foreign earnings which were in lower tax jurisdictions 

our 2011 net earnings were 3057 million or 657 per diluted share compared with 1117 million or 242 per diluted share in 2010 and 813 million or 236 per diluted share in 2009 on a nongaap basis 2009 earnings were 897 million or 197 per diluted share earnings in 2011 and 2010 were not affected by the sico merger transaction please refer to liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of net earnings 

north america 

sales for our north america segment were 12895 million in 2011 or 1341 million higher than sales of 11554 million in 2010 the sales increase in 2011 included 759 million of sales from our lochinvar acquisition completed on august 26 2011 our commercial water heater volumes were also higher in 2011 in advance of a pending regulatory change in southern california a material related price increase effective in april 2011 and a full year of sales of gas tankless products also contributed to increased sales in 2011 our north america sales of 11554 million in 2010 were 195 million higher than sales of 11359 million in 2009 resulting from higher sales in canada and additional sales derived from our purchase of the right to market and sell gas tankless water heaters in july of 2010 

operating earnings for north america were 1540 million in 2011 or 628 million higher than earnings of 912 million in 2010 operating earnings in 2010 were adversely impacted by a pretax charge of 354 million for flood damage to our water heater manufacturing facility located in ashland city tn in may 2010 this facility was temporarily shut down and production of water heaters was transferred to our other water heater manufacturing facilities in the us canada and mexico the total direct cost for the flood damage was 673 million and included repair of buildings and equipment site cleanup and restoration and writeoff of inventory and fixed assets insurance proceeds were 319 million resulting in a net charge for direct flood expenses of 354 million additional detail is provided in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements also included in 2011 is an 112 million pretax gain for recovery of costs and damages associated with a legal settlement relating to an issue with a component part supplied by one of our vendors this gain is reflected in the “restructuring impairment and settlement income expensenet” line in the accompanying financial statements the 112 million gain was partially offset by 82 million of product warranty expense associated with a similar component issue in canada and recorded as cost of products sold in 2011 the increased operating earnings in 2011 when compared to 2010 excluding the above items were due primarily to 130 million of operating profit contributed by our lochinvar acquisition operating earnings were 912 million in 2010 or 246 million less than earnings of 1158 million in 2009 the lower earnings in 2010 resulted from the 354 million pretax flood expense which more than offset the impact of higher volumes in canada and commercial products 

the operating margin for the north america segment was 119 percent in 2011 compared to 110 percent in 2010 excluding the 354 million of flood related expense the improved margin in 2011 was due mostly to the addition of higher margin lochinvar products as well as increased volumes of relatively higher margin commercial products the operating margin in 2009 was 102 percent the improved margin in 2010 from 2009 was due to cost containment activities and lower warranty costs which more than offset certain inefficiencies resulting from the may 2010 flood in our ashland city tn manufacturing facility 

rest of world 

sales for our rest of world segment in 2011 were 4556 million or 867 million higher than sales of 3689 million in 2010 sales of a o smith branded products in china grew by 838 million to 3717 million and sales in india more than doubled to 181 million in 2011 sales for swt were 130 million lower in 2011 than 2010 primarily due to inefficiencies as a result of the move of the manufacturing facility sales for our rest of world segment in 2009 were 2565 million the increase in sales in 2010 was due mostly to significantly higher sales of a o smith branded products in china resulting from geographic expansion market share gains and new product introductions as well as additional sales from swt acquired in november 2009 

  

operating earnings for our rest of world segment were 427 million in 2011 compared to 2010 earnings of 424 million as increased earnings for our a o smith branded products in china were offset by losses at swt of 106 million in 2011 compared to losses of 32 million in 2010 rest of world operating earnings were 330 million in 2009 the increase in earnings in 2010 from 2009 of 94 million was due mostly to higher earnings for a o smith branded products the operating margins for our rest of world segment were 94 percent 115 percent and 129 percent in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the decline in margin in 2011 was primarily due to losses at swt resulting from lower sales and costs associated with moving to a new manufacturing facility in 2011 the increase in margin in 2010 from 2009 was due mostly to increased volumes of a o smith branded products in china 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we constantly reevaluate these significant factors and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an armslength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct annual thorough and competent valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment in goodwill in 2011 however in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a 33 million impairment charge for trademarks recorded as part of the swt acquisition 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed on a periodic basis at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year as of december 31 2011 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million per occurrence 

gsw inc gsw insurance coverage included selfinsurance retentions that varied by business segment and by year effective april 3 2006 gsw maintained a 250 million aggregate loss retention through selfinsurance and captive insurance company coverage gsw claims occurring on or after july 1 2006 are covered under our insurance program 

  

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also use an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected rate of return on plan assets was 875 percent in 2011 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs decreased to 535 percent in 2011 from 580 percent in 2010 in 2012 the forecasted rate of return on plan assets is 850 percent and the discount rate is 490 percent 

in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluate our pension plan’s current and target asset allocation the expected longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is between 50 to 60 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2011 was 55 percent to equity managers 37 percent to bond managers five percent to private equity managers and the remainder in money market instruments we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical tenyear and 25year compounded annualized returns are 55 percent and 92 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the expected longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 850 percent expected return on assets for 2012 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2011 were based on the aon hewitt aa only above median yield curve which was designed by aon hewitt to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the aa only above median curve represents a series of annual discount rates from bonds with aa minimum average rating as rated by moody’s investor service moody’s standard  poor’s sp and fitch the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2010 and 2009 were based on the hewitt top quartile yield curve htq the htq was a hypothetical double a yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates each bond issue underlying the htq was required to have a rating of aa or better by moody’s or a rating of aa or better by sp aon hewitt no longer supports the previous yield curve model and the aa only above median yield curve closely follows the previous yield curve the discount rates determined on the basis described above were 490 percent 535 percent and 580 percent at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

we estimate that we will recognize approximately 135 million of pension expense in 2012 compared to 33 million in 2011 the increase in 2012 expense is due to the decrease in both the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2012 by approximately 21 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2012 net pension expense by approximately 13 million 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201105 “comprehensive income topic 220 presentation of comprehensive income” asu no 201105 eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders’ equity asu 201105 will be effective for the quarter ending march 31 2012 the adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our financial condition or results of operations but will impact the presentation of our financial statements we are currently evaluating the presentation options 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201108 “ testing of goodwill for impairment topic 350”  asu no 201108 allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test needs to be performed under the option an entity no longer would be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless it determines based on that qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount the asu may change how a company tests goodwill for impairment but should not change the timing or measurement of goodwill impairments asu 201108 will be effective for the year ending december 31 2012 we are currently reviewing the standard for applicability 

  

outlook 

we continued to demonstrate that we can be successful in creating shareholder value without a benefit from new construction or a stable economy and we believe we are wellpositioned for future growth when new construction and the economy experience a sustained recovery our balance sheet and cash flow are strong and will support our active acquisition opportunities our replacement water heater business in north america remains stable and we are well established in china and india the addition of lochinvar and its potential to grow in both the domestic and international markets is another positive which we expect will add 40 to 50 per share to our results in 2012 

while we carefully watch for signs of an economic slowdown in china and are concerned about the ongoing weakness of domestic construction we believe our china businesses will grow approximately twice as fast as china’s gdp rate we could see a decline in north american commercial volumes as a result of the prebuy in the fourth quarter 2011 related to the southern california air quality standard change but we believe the balance of north american water heater volumes will be flat in 2012 because of the replacement business we expect our lochinvar business will grow in excess of ten percent in 2012 compared with full year 2011 as the boiler industry continues to transition from lower efficiency to higher efficiency boilers we expect improved operating performance from our india water heater and china water treatment businesses in 2012 compared with 2011 however we estimate significantly higher pension expense in 2012 partially due to a lower discount rate and lower expected investment returns all this considered we estimate 2012 earnings will be in a range of 265 and 285 per diluted share this range does not include the potential impact from any future acquisitions or the impact of our rbc share activity 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal foreign state local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2011 and are not expected to be material in any single year we have accrued amounts associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2011 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 704 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 70 million it is important to note that gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2011 we had 3639 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 19 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 07 million 

smith investment company transaction 

on december 9 2008 we entered into a merger agreement with our largest stockholder sico providing for sico to become a whollyowned subsidiary of our company in a tax free exchange as a result of the merger the stockholders of sico now own shares of our company directly rather than through sico pursuant to the merger agreement stockholders of sico received 2396 shares of our class a common stock and 0463 shares of our common stock for each share of sico they held subject to a portion of the common stock being placed in escrow to satisfy indemnity claims that we may have under the 

  

merger agreement prior to the merger sico owned approximately 979 percent of our outstanding class a common stock and approximately 71 of our outstanding common stock the merger agreement was approved by our stockholders on april 14 2009 and was consummated on april 22 2009 

the transaction with sico was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with sico as the accounting acquirer and our company which is the surviving entity for legal purposes as the accounting acquiree as this is a common control transaction under accounting standards codification asc 805 business combinations the transaction is accounted for as an equity transaction under asc 81010 consolidations the acquisition of a noncontrolling interest does not require purchase accounting 

furthermore because sico is the continuing reporting entity for accounting purposes the reports filed by us as the surviving corporation in the transaction will parallel the financial reporting required under us gaap and securities and exchange commission reporting rules as if sico were the legal successor as of the date of the transaction accordingly prior period financial information presented in our financial statements reflects the historical activity of sico 

on january 19 2009 sico distributed all of its assets and liabilities other than its ownership of our stock these assets and liabilities related primarily to the multicolor printing business conducted through berlin industries inc and the commercial warehousing trucking and packaging business conducted through central states distribution service inc for periods prior to this distribution the results of operations net assets and cash flows for these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements

on december 12 2010 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our electrical products business to regal beloit corporation for 700 million in cash and approximately 283 million shares of regal beloit corporation common stock the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2011 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions due to the pending sale our electrical products segment has been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented for further information about the electrical products segment see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements entitled “discontinued operations” which appears on page 36 

the following table summarizes our sales from continuing operations this summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item 8 in this document 

 

 water products 

in our water products business sales increased 8 percent or 1143 million in 2010 compared with the prior year a 30 percent increase in sales of water heaters in china and a full year of sales from our 2009 water treatment acquisition represent the majority of the increase 

we serve residential and commercial end markets in north america with a broad range of products including 

residential gas gas tankless and electric water heaters  our residential water heaters come in sizes ranging from 25 gallon pointofuse models to 119 gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges we offer electric natural gas and liquid propane models as well as solar tanks and gas tankless units for today’s energy efficient homes north american residential water heater sales in 2010 were approximately 850 million or 57 percent of company revenues 

commercial standard and specialty water heaters our gas oil electric and tankless water heaters come in capacities ranging from 6 gallons to 594 gallons and are used by customers who require a consistent economical source of hot water typical applications include restaurants hotels and motels laundries car washes and small businesses 

our water products business also manufactures coppertube boilers and expansion tanks and related products and parts 

a significant portion of our water products business is derived from the replacement of existing product and we believe that the sale of product to the north american residential new housing construction market represents less than 10 percent of the segment’s total residential water heater sales 

we are the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in north america and we have a leading share in both the residential and standard commercial segments of the market as the leader in the residential water heating market segment we offer an extensive line of highefficiency gas and electric models in the commercial market segment we believe our comprehensive product line as well as our highefficiency products give us a competitive advantage in this highermargin segment of the water heating industry 

our water products wholesale distribution channel includes more than 1100 independent wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 4400 selling locations serving residential and commercial markets we also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel in this channel our customers include five of the seven largest national hardware and home center chains including longstanding exclusive branding relationships with both lowe’s companies inc and sears roebuck and co 

  

we entered the chinese water heater market through a joint venture in 1995 buying out our partner three years later since that time we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building a o smith brand recognition in the chinese residential and commercial markets in 2010 the chinese water products operation generated sales of 2879 million an increase of 30 percent compared with 2009 we believe we are one of the leading suppliers of water heaters to the residential market in china 

in 2008 we established a sales office in india and began importing products specifically designed for india from our nanjing china facility we began manufacturing water heaters in india in the second quarter of 2010 

in november 2009 we purchased 80 percent of the water treatment business of tianlong holding co ltd of hong kong and we are operating the business as the newly formed a o smith shanghai water treatment products co ltd through this company and our current water heater distribution channels we manufacture and supply water treatment products such as reverse osmosis units to the china residential and commercial markets as well as export markets throughout the world in the fourth quarter of 2010 we purchased the remaining 20 percent interest in tianlong holding co ltd and we now own 100 percent of the company 

on july 1 2010 we acquired the rights from takagi industrial co ltd of fujicity shizuoka japan to market tankless water heaters in north america and entered into a longterm agreement with takagi industrial to supply tankless water heaters as part of the venture we are taking over the management of takagi’s north american sales and distribution organization through this venture we offer a full line of tankless gas water heaters under our own brands in association with the takagi brand 

our energy efficient product offering continues to be a growing driver of our business our cyclone product family now represents 21 of our tanktype commercial product unit sales in the us and it offers significant energy savings and a short payback to our customers in 2010 we introduced residential solar and heat pump water heaters in the us as well as other higher efficiency water heating solutions to round out our energy efficient product offering globally we offer water heating products using renewable solar and heat pump technologies 

we sell our water heating products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design quality of products and services performance and price our principal water heating competitors in the united states include rheem manufacturing company bradfordwhite corporation and lochinvar corporation our primary competitor in china is haier appliances a chinese company but we also compete with ariston siemens and midea in the electric water heater market and rinnai and noritz in the gas instantaneous water heater market additionally we compete with numerous other chinese private and stateowned water heater and boiler manufacturing companies in china 

raw material 

raw materials for our manufacturing operations which consist primarily of steel are generally available from several sources in adequate quantities a portion of our customers are contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in steel prices significant volatility in steel costs has occurred over the last several years 

research and development 

in order to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin and at our operating locations total expenditures for research and development in 2010 2009 and 2008 were 371 310 and 288 million respectively 

patents and trademarks 

we own and use in our businesses various trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and licenses we do not believe that our business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such trademark trade name patent trade secret or license however our trade name is important with respect to our products particularly in china 

  

employees 

our continuing operations employed approximately 10400 employees as of december 31 2010 

backlog 

due to the shortcycle nature of our businesses none of our operations sustain significant backlogs

 item 1a – risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

 

 we have entered into an agreement to sell our electrical products business to regal beloit corporation for 700 million in cash and approximately 283 million shares of regal beloit corporation common stock the completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions including the absence of a material adverse change in the electrical products business and the receipt of approvals nonobjections or clearances from antitrust regulators including the federal trade commission and antitrust division of the us department of justice under the hartscottrodino act we cannot assure that these approvals nonobjections and clearances will be obtained or if they are obtained that they will not impose conditions on or require divestitures relating to the operations or assets of the electrical products business or regal beloit these conditions or divestitures or any challenge to the transaction may jeopardize or delay the completion of the transaction result in additional expenditures of money and resources reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction or materially adversely affect the stock prices of our company and regal beloit these and other factors could cause our ability to complete the sale on the terms and within the time frames anticipated to be different than expected we cannot guarantee that we will complete the sale of our electrical products business or that we will realize the expected net proceeds from the sale in a manner that allows us to use such proceeds to repay debt make a contribution to our pension plan and pursue acquisitions 

  

 the us economy is improving and other geographic areas in which we operate are showing signs of improvement as well the global credit and capital markets are still showing signs of stress however and threaten to stall or reverse the course of the recovery if this were to occur it could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition and slower adoption of energy efficient products which could negatively impact our profitability andor cash flow in addition a deterioration in current economic conditions including the credit market conditions could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials and increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 a portion of our products are sold into the new residential and commercial construction markets the strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and business investment which are a function of many factors beyond our control including interest rates employment levels availability of credit and consumer confidence further downturns in the new construction markets we serve could result in lower revenues and lower profitability new housing starts declined in 2008 and 2009 and were flat in 2010 and may continue at the lower levels or decline further we believe that less than ten percent of our water products residential businesses is affected by changes in the residential housing construction markets commercial construction activity could continue the decline that began in the second half of 2008 and declined further in 2009 and 2010 furthermore though we believe that the majority of the commercial business we serve is for replacement we could also be affected by changes in the commercial construction market 

 

 we have experienced above average growth in sales in china if the chinese economy were to experience a significant slowdown it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 net sales to water product’s five largest customers represented approximately 43 percent of 2010 net sales from continuing operations we expect that customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our dependence on sales from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products to our competitors or to other sources the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or our inability to execute on pricing actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price we compete against manufacturers located primarily in north america and china some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing research and development and distribution resources than we have we cannot assure that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 approximately 355 percent of our 2010 net sales were attributable to products manufactured outside of the united states principally in china approximately 5900 of our 10400 total employees from continuing operations are located in china in 2010 we opened a manufacturing plant in india international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade restrictions the impact of foreign government regulations and the effects of income and withholding tax governmental expropriation and differences in business practices we may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenue unfavorable changes in the political regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we have significant operations outside of the united states primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent india and mexico and therefore hold assets incur liabilities earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u s dollar the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars as a result we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates imposition or increase in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries labor relations problems hyperinflation in some foreign countries and imposition or increase of investments or other restrictions by foreign governments or the imposition of environmental or employment laws furthermore we typically price our products in our foreign operations in local currencies as a result an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of profitable foreign subsidiaries can have a negative effect on our profitability in addition to currency translation risks we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries functional currency the above mentioned risks in north america and asia may hurt our ability to generate revenue and profits in those regions in the future 

 

 due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a non–us government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws which are complex may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 the market prices for certain raw materials we purchase primarily steel have been very volatile in the recent past while our company periodically enters into supply contracts to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in any customer recovery of increased material costs which could negatively impact our profitability in addition in some cases we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components required in the manufacture of our product a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase cost which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 product defects can occur through our own product development and design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities we may incur various expenses related to product defects including product warranty costs product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs while we maintain a reserve for our product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve resulting in a need to increase our accruals for warranty charges in addition the reputation of our brand may be diminished by product defects and recalls further our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 due to the negative investment returns in 2008 the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by 2213 million at december 31 2010 beginning in 2008 the minimum required contribution equals the target normal cost plus a seven year amortization of any funding shortfall offset by any erisa credit balance the company is required to make a minimal contribution to the plan in 2011 the company is forecasting contributions of up to 200 million in 2011 using a portion of the cash proceeds from the expected sale of the electrical products business which would be in lieu of over 200 million in contributions that likely would have to be made over the next five years the company is forecasting no contributions in 2012 however the company cannot provide any assurance that the sale of the electrical products business will be completed and provide the funds for such a contribution in 2011 among the key assumptions inherent in the actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making the contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing the company 

 

 our total assets include significant goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at our business does not meet expectations we may be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill may affect our ability to maintain the required debttocapital ratio existing under our debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 we purchased 80 percent of the water treatment business of tianlong holding co ltd of hong kong in november 2009 and purchased the remaining 20 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 we are operating the business as a o smith shanghai water treatment products co ltd the successful integration of the acquisition will require substantial attention from our management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time management has to serve and attract customers we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate this acquisition that this acquisition will operate profitably or that it will be able to achieve the financial or operational success we expect from the acquisition the progress of our water treatment business has been slower than anticipated due to a number of unforeseen challenges and we incurred a small loss in 2010 our financial condition cash flows and operational results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate the acquired business or if our other businesses suffer on account of the increased focus on the acquired business 

  

 acquisitions we have made since 2001 have had a significant impact on our results of operations while we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and we intend to use a portion of the cash proceeds from the expected sale of the electrical products business we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms utilize cash flow from operations obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future if we complete any future acquisitions then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing we cannot assure you that future acquisitions will not have a material adverse affect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our water heater products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture sale and use of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will successfully weather the current economic downturn in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements these include energy efficiency climate emissions labeling and safetyrelated requirements while we believe our products are currently some of the most efficient safest and environmentfriendly products available a significant change to these regulatory requirements whether federal state or local or otherwise to industry standards could substantially increase manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 our success may depend on our ability to adapt to technological changes in the water heating and water treatment industry if we are unable to timely develop and introduce new products or enhance existing products in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or demands our competitiveness could be materially and adversely affected 

 

 we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock currently are entitled as a class to elect only onethird of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit smith family have entered into a voting trust agreement with respect to shares of our class a common stock and shares of our common stock they own as of december 31 2010 these members of the smith family own approximately 5633 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and common stock taken together as a single class and approximately 8438 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock as a separate class due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and shares of our class a common stock the smith family is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control this ownership position may increase if other members of the smith family enter into the voting trust agreement and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our class a common stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our common stock the voting trust agreement provides that in the event one of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our class a common stock such shares of our class a common stock are automatically exchanged for shares of our common stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust in addition the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our class a common stock and our common stock proposed to be withdrawn or transferred from the trust as a result the smith family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the smith family decide to transfer their shares

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

a o smith corporation is a leading manufacturer of water heating equipment and electric motors serving a diverse mix of residential commercial and industrial end markets principally in the united states and china our company has been comprised of two reporting segments water products and electrical products on december 12 2010 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our electrical products company to regal beloit corporation for 700 million in cash and approximately 283 million shares of regal beloit common stock the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2011 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions due to the pending sale our electrical products segment has been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented our water products business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of residential gas and electric water heaters standard and specialty commercial water heating equipment high efficiency copper tube boilers water treatment products and water system tanks in 2010 sales for our water products segment were 14893 million and discontinued operations sales for our electrical products segment were 7018 million 

our water products water heater operations in china grew significantly in 2010 we expect this growth to continue at a rate of nearly two times the growth in china gdp as geographic expansion market share gains and new product introductions contribute to our growth the north american residential and commercial markets for our water products segment remain weak due to the relatively low number of housing starts and lack of commercial construction activity although residential and commercial replacement demand significantly supported our sales in 2010 our 2010 north american residential and commercial growth in sales was essentially flat for the total year 

water products recognized a pretax charge of 354 million in 2010 for expenses related to damages to its water heater manufacturing facility located in ashland city tn caused by record flooding of the cumberland river this facility was temporarily shut down and production of water heaters was transferred to our other water heater manufacturing facilities in the us canada and mexico our recovery from the flood was essentially completed by year end 2010 we lost some sales orders in 2010 due to the flood however we retained all customers from which we lost orders 

we purchased the remaining 20 percent interest in a o smith shanghai water treatment products co ltd swt from our partner in the fourth quarter of 2010 and now own 100 percent of this company the progress of our water treatment business has been slower than anticipated due to a number of unforeseen challenges and we incurred a small loss in 2010 we continue to expect strong long term sales growth opportunities in the water treatment industry in china we introduced a o smith branded water treatment products into our china retail distribution network during 2010 

during the second quarter of 2010 we began production of residential water heaters for the indian market at our new plant located just outside of bangalore india 

on july 1 2010 we acquired the rights from takagi industrial co ltd of fujicity shizuoka japan to market tankless water heaters in north america and entered into a longterm agreement with takagi industrial to supply tankless water heaters as part of the venture we are taking over the management of takagi’s north american sales and distribution organization through this venture we offer a full line of tankless gas water heaters under our own brands in association with the takagi brand in 2010 we estimate the industry sold approximately 430000 tankless water heaters in north america and we expect the market to grow by 10 percent in each of the next few years 

on october 11 2010 our board of directors declared a threefortwo stock split of our class a common stock and common stock in the form of a fifty percent stock dividend to stock holders of record on october 29 2010 and payable on november 15 2010 all references in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to number of shares and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the split 

we plan to take advantage of our strong balance sheet and the proceeds from the sale of electrical products company to focus on a number of strategic initiatives we will look to grow our core residential and commercial water heating and water treatment businesses into fastgrowing geographic markets we will continue to pursue acquisitions in markets such as south america asia and africa 

we also intend to expand our core product line by looking at acquisitions joint ventures or other business relationships that will allow us to expand our product offerings of boilers heat pumps and other high efficiency products finally we will pursue opportunities in new and unique technologies that will be attractive to our customers and channel partners and will leverage our core competencies to create value for our shareholders 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we achieved net earnings inclusive of discontinued operations and noncontrolling interest of 1117 million or 242 per diluted share in 2010 compared with 813 million or 236 per diluted share in 2009 and 217 million or 153 per diluted share in 2008 our 2010 earnings include an aftertax 216 million or 047 per share charge for the flooding of our ashland city tn water heater plant in may 2010 our 2009 and 2008 reported earnings and earnings per share under gaap have been impacted by required accounting related to our transaction with smith investment company sico which closed on april 22 2009 and is discussed in more detail in note 1 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for accounting purposes the former controlling shareholder sico is treated as the acquirer even though we a o smith corporation are the surviving corporation from a legal standpoint 2008 and 2009 earnings and earnings per share amounts reported by us include sico earnings and shares outstanding as adjusted for the exchange ratio of the merger transaction prior to the closing date 

the primary accounting impact of the sico transaction is in the calculation of earnings per share because the accounting rules require the use of sico adjusted average shares outstanding prior to closing the sico transaction did not impact 2010 results eliminating the impact of the transaction as set forth in the table below nongaap net earnings including net earnings from discontinued operations in 2009 were 897 million or 197 per diluted share and compare with nongaap net earnings including net earnings from discontinued operations of 819 million or 180 per diluted share in 2008 

we believe that presenting nongaap financial information permits investors to compare our financial results for the current period to our historical results for the periods reported although 2010 financial information was not affected by the transaction 2009 full year and previously reported periods were impacted management also uses the nongaap information for all internal purposes of reporting results of operations including return on investment measures utilized in determining certain incentivebased compensation and employee profit sharing amounts below is a reconciliation of gaap to nongaap earnings and earnings per share as discussed above 

a o smith corporation 

reconciliation of nongaap data 

in millions except per share amounts 

 

 the nongaap presentation of adjusted earnings per share should not be construed as an alternative to the results reported in accordance with us gaap it is provided solely to assist in the investor’s understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the company’s operations 

 

 our results of continuing operations will be discussed later in this section and our discontinued operation’s financial information is provided in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our working capital for continuing operations was 2095 million at december 31 2010 compared with 1217 million and 1292 million at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively the 878 million increase in working capital in 2010 resulted from higher cash levels outside the united states sales related increases late in the quarter in accounts receivable and higher inventory levels to support higher sales new businesses and new product launches which were partially offset by higher accounts payable balances related to higher sales 

  

operating cash provided by continuing operations during 2010 was 633 million compared with 1229 million during 2009 and 816 million during 2008 the increase in our working capital needs this year compared with a decline last year explain the majority of the decline in 2010 cash flow higher net earnings in 2009 compared with 2008 and the changes in cashrelated working capital accounts described above explain the majority of the improvement in 2009 we expect our operating activities from continuing operations will use cash of approximately 10 million in 2011 which includes a tax deductible contribution of approximately 200 million to our pension plan subject to the anticipated closing of the electrical products transaction 

our capital expenditures from continuing operations were 535 million in 2010 higher than the 427 million spent in 2009 as a result of 185 million in capital spending related to the flooding in may our capital spending in 2008 was 412 million we are projecting 2011 capital expenditures of between 70 and 80 million and 2011 depreciation and amortization of approximately 45 million 2011 capital spending includes approximately 20 million to begin construction of a second water heater manufacturing plant in nanjing china the new plant is expected to add 50 percent more capacity to our china water heater operations 

in november 2010 we completed a 425 million multicurrency three year revolving credit facility with a group of nine banks the facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to 525 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31 2010 

the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings and it expires on november 12 2013 as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt at december 31 2010 we had available borrowing capacity of 2834 million under this facility we believe that the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

our total debt was 2610 million at the end of december 2010 compared with 2532 million at the end of 2009 our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 228 percent at the end of 2010 and 243 percent at the end of 2009 we expect to use a portion of the net proceeds from the expected sale of our electrical products business to pay down existing floating rate debt of approximately 142 million the sale is expected to close in the first half of 2011 subject to regulatory approvals 

gsw operated a captive insurance company to provide product liability and general liability insurance to its subsidiary american water heater company american we decided to cover american’s liability exposures with our existing insurance programs and operate the captive in runoff status effective july 1 2006 the reinsurance company restricts the amount of capital which must be maintained by the captive at december 31 2010 the restricted amount was 116 million compared with 172 million at the end of 2009 and is included in other noncurrent assets the restricted assets are invested in shortterm securities during 2010 the captive sold approximately 46 million in marketable securities and paid us a 46 million dividend the proceeds of this dividend were used to pay down debt 

our us pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations while we were required to make a minimal contribution to the plan in 2010 we elected to make a contribution of 306 million in 2011 we are forecasting tax deductible contributions to the pension plan in the amount of 200 million subject to the anticipated closing of our electrical products segment sale if the 200 million contribution is made in 2011 we expect that no contributions will be made to the plan in 2012 for further information on our pension plan see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in december our board of directors ratified its authorization of a stock repurchase program in the amount of 15 million shares of our common stock as of december 31 2010 no shares had been repurchased 

we have paid dividends for 71 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 19 years we paid total dividends of 54 per share in 2010 compared with 51 per share in 2009 

  

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 is as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2010 the liability for uncertain income tax positions was 27 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to the company’s scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments considered firm 

results of operations 

our sales from continuing operations in 2010 were 14893 million surpassing 2009 sales of 13750 million by 83 percent the increase in sales was due mostly to significantly higher sales in our water heater operations in china resulting from geographic expansion market share gains and new product introductions as well as additional sales from our water treatment business acquired in november 2009 our sales from continuing operations were 14513 million in 2008 the 763 million decline in sales from 2008 to 2009 was due to lower residential and commercial volume in north america reflecting softness in the domestic housing market and a slowdown in the commercial water heater business and was partially offset by strong growth in water heater sales in china and improved year over year pricing 

on december 13 2010 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our electrical products company to regal beloit corporation for 700 million in cash and approximately 283 million shares of regal beloit common stock the transaction which has been approved by both companies’ board of directors is expected to close in the first half of 2011 due to the pending sale our electrical products segment has been accorded discontinued operations treatment in the accompanying financial statements sales in 2010 including sales of 7018 million for our electrical products segment were 21911 million 

our gross profit margin for continuing operations in 2010 was 299 percent compared with 287 percent in 2009 and 258 percent in 2008 the improvement in margin from 2009 to 2010 was due to increased volume cost containment activities and lower warranty costs which more than offset certain inefficiencies resulting from the may flood in our ashland city tn water heater manufacturing facility the increase in profit margin from 2008 to 2009 resulted from increased higher margin china water heater volume aggressive cost reduction programs and lower material costs 

selling general and administrative expense sga was 369 million higher in 2010 than in 2009 the increased sga the majority of which was incurred in our china water heater operation was associated with selling costs to support higher volume and new product lines additional sga associated with our 2009 water treatment acquisition also contributed to the increase sga was 85 million higher in 2009 than 2008 resulting mostly from an 82 million increase in our china water heater operation in support of higher volumes 

pension expense for continuing operations in 2010 was 105 million compared to 88 million in 2009 and 61 million in 2008 the increase in pension expense from 2009 to 2010 was due to a decrease in the discount rate and increased amortization of deferred asset losses the increase in pension expense from 2008 to 2009 was due to lower investment returns caused by a decline in plan assets due to the market downturn in 2008 and the associated higher amortization of deferred asset losses 

  

the company recognized a pretax charge of 354 million in 2010 for flood damage to our water heater manufacturing facility located in ashland city tn caused by extremely heavy rainfall in may 2010 this facility was temporarily shut down and production of water heaters was transferred to our other water heater manufacturing facilities in the us canada and mexico site cleanup and restoration began as soon as the flood water subsided the total direct cost for the flood damage was 673 million and included repair of buildings and equipment site cleanup and restoration and writeoff of inventory and fixed assets insurance proceeds were 319 million resulting in a net charge for direct flood related expenses of 354 million our recovery from the may flooding was essentially completed by year end 2010 additional detail is provided in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we purchased the remaining 20 percent interest in swt from our partner in the fourth quarter of 2010 and now own 100 percent of this water treatment company at the same time we also settled certain disputes with our former partner relative to the condition of swt on the date of purchase the settlement resulted in a 50 million nontaxable gain additionally we incurred an impairment charge of 33 million related to the value of trademarks we received as part of the swt acquisition we also announced plans to move the water treatment operations to nanjing china to recognize synergies associated with our strong management team and the engineering center in place at our water heater operations in that city as a result of the announced relocation we recorded 18 million in moving costs during the fourth quarter of 2010 the net impact of the aforementioned transactions associated with our swt operation is a 01 million pretax expense for restructuring impairment and settlement income in 2010 corporate expense in 2009 included 13 million of restructuring charges the majority of which were associated with the loss on sale of a vacated facility from a previously owned business the 24 million of restructuring expense recorded in 2008 included 19 million of expenses incurred by sico relative to the merger transaction and 05 million related to the vacated facility sold in 2009 

interest expense net of the amount allocated to discontinued operations was 69 million 72 million and 110 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively interest expense that cannot be attributed to specific entities within the company was allocated to discontinued operations based on the ratio of net assets to be sold to the sum of consolidated net assets and debt exclusive of debt attributable to specific entities of the company the decline in continuing interest expense in 2010 was due to lower debt levels and the decline in 2009 was due to the combination of lower debt levels and lower interest rates 

net other expense was 05 million 28 million and 23 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the decline in other expense from 2010 to 2009 was due to a 24 million gain on the sale of a vacant parcel of land adjacent to our ashland city tn water heater plant in the fourth quarter of 2010 which was partially offset by increased bank fees associated with the completion of a new revolving credit agreement in the last quarter of 2010 the 05 million increase in 2009 other expense was due to a reduction in interest income resulting from the liquidation of short term securities in 2009 and 2008 and was partially offset by increased exchange losses in 2009 as foreign currencies strengthened against the u s dollar 

our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 233 percent in 2010 337 percent in 2009 and 368 percent in 2008 the significant decline in the effective rate from 2008 and 2009 to 2010 was due to lower domestic earnings in 2010 as a result of the 354 million pretax flood related expense as well as higher 2010 foreign earnings which are in low tax jurisdictions 

our 2010 net earnings on a gaap basis were 1117 million or 242 per share compared with 813 million or 236 per share in 2009 and 217 million or 153 per share in 2008 on a nongaap basis 2009 earnings were 897 million or 197 per share and 2008 earnings were 819 million or 180 per share earnings in 2010 were not affected by the sico merger transaction please refer to liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of net earnings 

water products 

sales activity for our water products segment was discussed in the first paragraph of the results of operations 

operating earnings for water products were 1329 million in 2010 or 107 percent less than earnings of 1489 million in 2009 the lower earnings in 2010 resulted from the 354 million pretax flood related expense which more than offset the impact of increased higher margin sales of water heaters in china and higher volume in canada and for commercial product operating earnings in 2009 were 105 percent higher than earnings of 1347 million in 2008 the improvement in 2009 earnings resulted from increased higher margin china water heater volumes continued aggressive cost reduction programs and lower material costs 

  

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we constantly reevaluate these significant factors and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an armslength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct annual thorough and competent valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment in goodwill however in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a 33 million impairment charge for trademarks recorded as part of the swt acquisition 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed on a periodic basis at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business a majority of these claims involve our water products business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year as of december 31 2010 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million per occurrence 

gsw insurance coverage included selfinsurance retentions that varied by business segment and by year effective april 3 2006 gsw maintained a 250 million aggregate loss retention through selfinsurance and captive insurance company coverage gsw claims occurring on or after july 1 2006 are covered under the company’s insurance program 

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also use an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time 

  

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected rate of return on plan assets is 875 percent in 2010 unchanged from 2009 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs decreased from 660 percent in 2009 to 580 percent in 2010 in 2011 the rate of return on plan assets is 875 percent and the discount rate is 535 percent 

in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluate our pension plan’s target asset allocation the historical longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is between 60 to 70 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2010 was 62 percent to equity managers 30 percent to bond managers six percent to private equity managers and the remainder in money market instruments we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical 10year and 25year compounded annualized returns are 46 percent and 100 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the historical longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 875 percent expected return on assets for 2011 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were based on the hewitt top quartile yield curve htq which was designed by hewitt associates to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the htq is a hypothetical double a yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates each bond issue underlying the htq is required to have a rating of aa or better by moody’s investor service inc or a rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s because of the volatile bond market we adjusted our discount rate as of december 31 2008 to take into account the effect of bonds that were on credit watch on december 31 2008 and were subsequently downgraded below a aa rating before january 15 2009 the discount rates determined on the basis described above were 535 percent 580 percent and 660 percent at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

we estimate that we will recognize approximately 20 million of pension expense in 2011 compared to 105 million in 2010 the decline in 2011 is due to a planned 200 million pension contribution in 2011 subject to the anticipated closing of the electrical products segment sale lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2011 by approximately 17 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2011 net pension expense by approximately 10 million 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an amendment to accounting codification statement “asc” topic 820 “fair value measurements and disclosures” the amendment to topic 820 improves disclosures about fair value measurements by requiring disclosure of transfers in and out of levels 1 and 2 as well as additional disclosures related to level 3 inputs we adopted the amendment to asc 820 on january 1 2010 adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2009 the fasb issued asc subtopic 85510 formerly statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 165 “subsequent events” subtopic 85510 addresses the types and timing of events that should be reported in the financial statements for events that occur between the balance sheet date and the date the financial statements are issued or available to be issued we reviewed events for possible inclusion in the financial statements through the date the financial statements were available to be issued 

in march 2008 the fasb issued asc subtopic 81510 “derivatives and hedging” subtopic 81510 formerly sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb no 133” is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows asc 81510 applies to all derivative instruments within the scope of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas 133” it also applies to nonderivative hedging instruments and all hedged items designated and qualifying under sfas 133 and is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 with early application encouraged this pronouncement encourages but does not require comparative disclosures for periods prior to its initial adoption we adopted asc 81510 on january 1 2009 adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued asc subtopic 8101065 “consolidations” formerly sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51” this pronouncement changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity this new consolidation method changes the accounting for transactions with minority interest holders and is effective beginning in 2009 we adopted asc 8101065 on january 1 2009 adoption of this statement has impacted our accounting for the sico transaction as well as the acquisition of the water treatment business of tianlong holding co ltd and has been incorporated in the accompanying financial statements

outlook 

a o smith corporation believes it is poised for growth going into 2011 we expect to benefit from continued double digit growth in our businesses in asia we also expect to benefit from the new highefficiency water heating products introduced last year along with new product introductions in north america and china scheduled for 2011 we believe the u s economy will continue on the road to recovery although we do not anticipate a sizable increase in the us new housing or commercial construction markets this year 

consequently we forecast earnings from continuing operations excluding the impact from future acquisitions of between 190 and 210 per share in 2011 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2010 and are not expected to be material in any single year we have accrued amounts associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

market risk 

we are exposed in continuing operations to various types of market risks primarily currency we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2010 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 488 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 48 million it is important to note that gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2010 we had 1440 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 21 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 03 million 

smith investment company transaction 

on december 9 2008 we entered into a merger agreement with our largest stockholder smith investment company sico providing for sico to become a whollyowned subsidiary of our company in a tax free exchange as a result of the merger the stockholders of sico now own shares of our company directly rather than through sico pursuant to the merger agreement stockholders of sico received 2396 shares of our class a common stock and 0463 shares of our common stock for each share of sico they held subject to a portion of the common stock being placed in escrow to satisfy indemnity claims that we may have under the merger agreement prior to the merger sico owned approximately 979 percent of our outstanding class a common stock and approximately 71 of our outstanding common stock the merger agreement was approved by our stockholders on april 14 2009 and was consummated on april 22 2009 

the transaction with sico has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition with sico as the accounting acquirer and our company which is the surviving entity for legal purposes as the accounting acquiree as this is a common control transaction under asc 805 business combinations formerly fas 141r the transaction is accounted for as an equity transaction under asc 81010 consolidations formerly fas 160 the acquisition of a noncontrolling interest does not require purchase accounting 

furthermore because sico is the continuing reporting entity for accounting purposes the reports filed by us as the surviving corporation in the transaction will parallel the financial reporting required under gaap and sec reporting rules as if sico were the legal successor as of the date of the transaction accordingly prior period financial information presented in our financial statements reflects the historical activity of sico 

on january 19 2009 sico distributed all of its assets and liabilities other than its ownership of our stock these assets and liabilities related primarily to the multicolor printing business conducted through berlin industries inc and the commercial warehousing trucking and packaging business conducted through central states distribution service inc for periods prior to this distribution the results of operations net assets and cash flows for these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements

 item 1  business 

we are a leading manufacturer of water heating equipment and electric motors serving a diverse mix of residential commercial and industrial end markets principally in the united states with a growing international presence our company is comprised of two reporting segments water products and electrical products our water products business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of residential gas and electric water heaters standard and specialty commercial water heating equipment highefficiency coppertube boilers water treatment products and water systems tanks our electrical products business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of hermetic motors fractional horsepower alternating current ac and direct current dc motors in 2009 we had net sales of approximately 20 billion with 69 percent attributable to our water products business and 31 percent attributable to our electrical products business 

the following table summarizes our sales by reporting segment this segment summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item 8 in this document 

 

 water products 

in our water products business sales decreased 5 percent or 763 million in 2009 compared with the prior year a 19 percent increase in sales of water heaters in china helped offset significantly lower residential and commercial volumes in north america 

we serve residential commercial and industrial end markets with a broad range of products including 

residential gas and electric water heaters  our residential water heaters come in sizes ranging from twogallon pointofuse models to 120gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges we offer electric natural gas and liquid propane models as well as solar booster tanks and gas tankless units for today’s energy efficient homes north american residential water heater sales in 2009 were approximately 857 million or 62 percent of segment revenues 

commercial standard and specialty water heaters our gas oil and electric water heaters come in capacities ranging from 6 gallons to 600 gallons and are used by customers who require a consistent economical source of hot water typical applications include restaurants hotels and motels laundries car washes and small businesses 

a significant portion of our water products business is derived from the replacement of existing product and it is believed that the sale of product to the north american residential new housing construction market represents approximately 10 percent of the segment’s total residential water heater sales our water products business also manufactures coppertube boilers and expansion tanks and related products and parts 

we are the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in north america and we have a leading share in both the residential and commercial segments of the market in the commercial market segment we believe our comprehensive product line as well as our highefficiency products give us a competitive advantage in this highermargin segment of the water heating industry as the leader in the residential water heating market segment we offer an extensive line of highefficiency gas and electric models 

our water products wholesale distribution channel includes more than 1100 independent wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 4400 selling locations serving residential commercial and industrial markets we also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel in this channel our customers include five of the seven largest national hardware and home center chains including longstanding exclusive branding relationships with both lowe’s companies inc and sears roebuck and co 

  

we entered the chinese water heater market through a joint venture in 1995 buying out our partner three years later since that time we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building a o smith brand recognition in the chinese residential and commercial markets in 2009 the chinese water products operation generated sales of 2211 million an increase of 19 percent compared with 2008 we believe we are one of the top two suppliers of water heaters to the residential market in china 

in 2008 we established a sales office in india and began importing products specifically designed for india from our nanjing china facility in 2009 we finalized the acquisition of land near bangalore and started construction of a water heater manufacturing facility we expect to begin manufacturing water heaters in india in the second quarter of 2010 

in november 2009 we purchased the water treatment business of tianlong holding co ltd of hong kong we hold 80 percent of the newly formed a o smith shanghai water treatment products co ltd through this company and eventually our current water heater distribution channels we will supply reverse osmosis water purification products to the china residential and commercial markets as well as export markets throughout the world 

our energy efficient product offering continues to be a growing driver of our business our cyclone product family now represents 20 of our standard commercial product unit sales and it offers significant energy savings and a short payback to our customers globally we have launched new water heating products using renewable solar and heat pump technologies in 2010 we plan to introduce residential solar and heat pump water heaters in the us as well as higher efficiency water heating solutions to round out our energy efficient product offering 

we sell our water heating products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design quality of products and services performance and price our principal domestic water heating competitors include rheem manufacturing company bradfordwhite corporation and lochinvar corporation our primary competitor in china is haier appliances a chinese company but we also compete with ariston siemens and midea in the electric water heater market and rinnai and noritz in the gas instantaneous water heater market additionally we compete with numerous other chinese private and stateowned water heater and boiler manufacturing companies 

electrical products 

in our electrical products business revenue declined nearly 30 percent due to the global recession sales in the segment were 620 million compared with 858 million in 2008 our original equipment manufacturers oem products were most severely impacted by the recession due to lower equipment sales in our end markets the trend to fix instead of replace equipment and channel inventory reductions of finished goods and components as our customers sought to preserve cash 

we are one of the four largest manufacturers of electric motors in north america we offer a comprehensive line of hermetic motors fractional horsepower ac and dc motors and integral horsepower motors ranging in size from subfractional c – frame ventilation motors up to 1320 horsepower hermetic and 400 horsepower integral motors we believe our extensive product offerings give us an advantage in our targeted markets allowing us to serve a wide range of our customers’ electric motor needs 

our motors are used in a wide range of targeted residential and commercial applications including hermetic motors that are sold worldwide to manufacturers of air conditioning and commercial refrigeration compressors fractional horsepower fan motors used in furnaces air conditioners and blowers fractional horsepower motors for pumps for home water systems swimming pools hot tubs and spas fractional horsepower motors used in other consumer products such as garage door openers and integral horsepower ac and dc motors for industrial and commercial applications sales to the global oems of heating ventilating air conditioning and refrigeration equipment including compressors accounted for approximately 50 percent of segment sales approximately 75 percent of our 2009 segment sales were to oems in a diverse mix of industries with the remainder of sales sold through aftermarket or distribution channels we believe that at least 25 percent of our total segment sales were attributable to products used outside of the united states a significant portion of our electrical products business is derived from the replacement of existing product and it is believed that the sale of product to the residential new housing construction market in north america represents approximately 25 percent of the segment’s total sales 

to remain a leader in this highly competitive industry we are committed to being a lowcost supplier of electric motors we have undertaken initiatives to accelerate costreduction in our motor operations to enhance our competitive position since 2001 these initiatives included the closure of eleven us facilities as well as our operations in budapest hungary bray ireland and taizhou china transferring the majority of related production to our lower cost operations in mexico and china 

  

in 2008 we closed our operations in scottsville ky and mebane nc consolidating our hermetic motor assembly operations in acuna mexico and suzhou and yueyang china in 2009 we constructed a new building in yueyang for our large centrifugal and screw compressor motor production this new building more than doubled our available manufacturing space and consolidated all of our production in yueyang under one roof we also became more vertically integrated as part of this expansion including the addition of rotor casting equipment and lamination punch presses the investment for this expansion totaled approximately 9 million 

in 2009 we also completed the installation of an erp system in our operations the system represented a total investment of approximately 12 million and is already yielding the expected benefits in increased productivity throughput and customer responsiveness we also completed our lean products initiative eliminating thousands of components from our product offering through product standardization 

energy efficiency continues to be a significant driver for our business especially our new product development activities we launched two new variable speed motor platforms in 2009 in our pool pump and residential hvac businesses we plan to launch several more variable speed high efficiency motor equivalents for most of our core product offerings we have significantly upgraded our technical capabilities to accomplish this product development 

we sell our electric motor products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies performance and price our principal competitors in the electric motor industry are emerson electric co regal beloit corporation and baldor electric company 

raw material 

raw materials for our manufacturing operations which consist primarily of steel copper and aluminum are generally available from several sources in adequate quantities we typically hedge a portion of our annual copper and aluminum purchases to protect against price volatility in addition a portion of our customers are contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in certain of our raw material prices significant volatility in steel copper and aluminum costs has occurred over the last several years 

research and development 

in order to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin and at our operating units total expenditures for research and development in 2009 2008 and 2007 were 526 485 and 478 million respectively 

patents and trademarks 

we own and use in our businesses various trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and licenses while a number of these are important to us we do not believe that our business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such trademark trade name patent trade secret or license 

employees 

our company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 16000 employees as of december 31 2009 

backlog 

due to the shortcycle nature of our businesses none of our operations sustain significant backlogs 

environmental laws 

our operations are governed by a variety of federal state and local laws intended to protect the environment while environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures compliance with the environmental laws has not had and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of our company see item 3

 item 1a – risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

 

 the us economy is improving and other geographic areas in which we operate are showing signs of improvement as well the global credit and capital markets are still showing signs of stress however and threaten to stall or reverse the course of the recovery if this were to occur it could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition and slower adoption of energy efficient products which could negatively impact our profitability andor cash flow in addition the current economic conditions including the credit market conditions could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials and increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 a portion of our products are sold into the new residential and commercial construction markets the strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and business investment which are a function of many factors beyond our control including interest rates employment levels availability of credit and consumer confidence further downturns in the new construction markets we serve could result in lower revenues and lower profitability new housing starts declined in 2008 and 2009 and may continue at the lower levels or decline further we believe that approximately 10 percent of our water products and 25 percent of our electrical products residential businesses respectively are affected by changes in the residential housing construction markets commercial construction activity which has been high in recent years could continue the decline that began in the second half of 2008 and declined further in 2009 furthermore though we believe that the majority of the commercial business we serve is for replacement we could also be affected by changes in the commercial construction market 

  

 we have experienced above average growth in sales in china for both our water products and electrical products segments if the chinese economy were to experience a significant slowdown it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 net sales to our operating units’ four largest customers represented approximately 29 percent of 2009 net sales we expect that customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future in light of the global economic downturn our dependence on sales from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products to our competitors or to other sources the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or our inability to execute on pricing actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design reliability quality of products and services advanced technologies product performance maintenance costs and price we compete against manufacturers located in the united states and throughout the world we also face potential competition from some oems to whom we sell our electrical products and from our customers and the end users of our products who continually assess any costs that could be reduced by vertically integrating or using alternate sources for the products we manufacture some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing and distribution resources than we have we cannot assure that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 a significant portion of our 2009 net sales were attributable to products manufactured outside of the united states principally in mexico and china approximately 4880 of our 16000 total employees and 14 of our 36 manufacturing facilities are located in mexico approximately 6386 employees and six manufacturing facilities are located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade restrictions the impact of foreign government regulations and the effects of income and withholding tax governmental expropriation and differences in business practices we may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenue unfavorable changes in the political regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 due to our global operations we are subject to many laws governing international relations including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a nonus government including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the us export administration act violations of these laws which are complex may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 almost all of our electric motor manufacturing productive labor hours are incurred in mexico and china the peso based costs we incur manufacturing these products are directly related to changes in labor costs in mexico and fluctuations in exchange rates of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar the labor costs we incur are measured in us dollars and based on the cost of labor in mexican pesos historically mexico has had higher wage inflation than the united states that inflation does not adversely affect our costs when there is a corresponding decrease in the value of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar however during periods in which the value of the mexican peso increases or remains stable relative to the us dollar higher wage inflation in mexico results in an increase in our labor costs manufacturing and material costs we incur in china are principally incurred in chinese rmb if the rmb continues to strengthen against the us dollar our costs would increase 

 

 the market prices for certain key materials we purchase eg steel copper aluminum diesel fuel and natural gas have been very volatile in the recent past while our company periodically enters into futures contracts to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases principally copper and aluminum significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in any customer recovery of increased material costs which could negatively impact our profitability in addition in some cases we are dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components required in the manufacture of our product a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase cost which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 due to the negative investment returns in 2008 the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by 233 million at december 31 2009 beginning in 2008 the minimum required contribution equals the target normal cost plus a seven year amortization of any funding shortfall offset by any erisa credit balance while the company is not required to make a contribution to the plan in 2010 the company is forecasting contributions of between 25 to 30 million and 40 to 50 million in 2010 and 2011 respectively among the key assumptions inherent in the actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making the contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing the company 

 

 our total assets include significant goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at either of our businesses does not meet expectations we may be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill may affect our ability to maintain the required debttocapital ratio existing under our debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

 we purchased 80 percent of the water treatment business of tianlong holding co ltd of hong kong on november 24 2009 the successful integration of the acquisition will require substantial attention from our management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time management has to serve and attract customers we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate this recent acquisition that this acquisition will operate profitably or that it will be able to achieve the financial or operational success we expect from the acquisition our financial condition cash flows and operational results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate the newly acquired business or if our other businesses suffer on account of the increased focus on the newly acquired business 

 

 acquisitions we have made since 1997 have had a significant impact on our results of operations while we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms utilize cash flow from operations obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future if we complete any future acquisitions then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing we cannot assure you that future acquisitions will not have a material adverse affect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our water heater and electric motor products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture sale and use of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will successfully weather the current economic downturn in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 in addition to issuing commercial paper and utilizing short term credit lines we rely on our 425 million revolving credit facility to support our daily operations the global credit markets tightened considerably in 2008 and recovered somewhat in 2009 if these conditions remain unchanged or worsen our replacement credit facility may have less favorable terms than the facility we have now in particular the new facility could have higher borrowing costs and more restrictive covenants and depending on banks’ willingness to lend the facility could be smaller in size if credit terms deteriorate considerably a credit facility with significantly less favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements these include energy efficiency climate emissions labeling and safetyrelated requirements while we believe our products are currently some of the most efficient safest and environmentfriendly products available a significant change to these regulatory requirements whether federal state or local or otherwise to industry standards could substantially increase manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

 we conduct our business internationally as a result our financial results may be negatively impacted by changes in international taxation rules in the united states if the united states international tax law changes are enacted as currently being discussed it may have a significant negative impact on our reported financial results and cash flows from operations 

 

 we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock currently are entitled as a class to elect only onethird of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit smith family have entered into a voting trust agreement with respect to shares of our class a common stock and shares of our common stock they own as of december 31 2009 these members of the smith family own approximately 5496 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and common stock taken together as a single class and approximately 8047 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock as a separate class due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and shares of our class a common stock the smith family is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control this ownership position may increase if other members of the smith family enter into the voting trust agreement and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our class a common stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our common stock the voting trust agreement provides that in the event one of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our class a common stock such shares of our class a common stock are automatically exchanged for shares of our common stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust in addition the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our class a common stock and our common stock proposed to be withdrawn or transferred from the trust as a result the smith family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the smith family decide to transfer their shares

we are involved in various unresolved legal actions administrative proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business involving product liability property damage insurance coverage exposure to asbestos and other substances patents and environmental matters including the disposal of hazardous waste although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss or recovery we believe based on past experience adequate reserves and insurance availability that these unresolved legal actions will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations a more detailed discussion of these matters appears in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

we achieved net earnings of 813 million or 339 per diluted share in 2009 compared with 217 million or 229 per diluted share in 2008 and 304 million or 321 per diluted share in 2007 our reported earnings and earnings per share under gaap have been impacted by required accounting related to our transaction with smith investment company sico which closed on april 22 2009 and is discussed in more detail in note 1 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for accounting purposes the former controlling shareholder sico is treated as the acquirer even though we a o smith corporation are the surviving corporation from a legal standpoint prior year and current year earnings and earnings per share amounts reported by us include sico earnings and shares outstanding as adjusted for the exchange ratio of the merger transaction prior to the closing date 

the primary accounting impact of the sico transaction is in the calculation of earnings per share because the accounting rules require the use of sico adjusted average shares outstanding prior to closing eliminating the impact of the transaction as set forth in the table below nongaap net earnings in 2009 were 897 million or 296 per diluted share and compare with nongaap net earnings of 819 million or 270 per diluted share in 2008 and with nongaap net earnings of 882 million or 285 per diluted share in 2007 the 2009 nongaap earnings and earnings per diluted share set all time full year records 

we believe that presenting nongaap financial information permits investors to compare our financial results for the current period to our historical results for the periods reported although future discrete quarterly financial information will not be affected by the transaction 2009 full year and previously reported periods were impacted during 2010 we will continue to present nongaap earnings per share information for purposes of comparing the financial results of the current period to our historical financial results management also uses the nongaap information for all internal purposes of reporting results of operations including return on investment measures utilized in determining certain incentivebased compensation and employee profit sharing amounts below is a reconciliation of gaap to nongaap earnings and earnings per share as discussed above

 the nongaap presentation of adjusted earnings per share should not be construed as an alternative to the results reported in accordance with us gaap it is provided solely to assist in the investor’s understanding of the impact of these items on the comparability of the company’s operations 

 

 our individual segment performance will be discussed later in this section 

  

our working capital for continuing operations was 2487 million at december 31 2009 compared with 2798 million and 3045 million at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively the 311 million reduction in working capital in 2009 resulted from lower inventory levels of 669 million as a result of focused inventory reduction programs at both businesses and higher accounts payable at our water products segment as a result of improved vendor terms these improvements were partially offset by a 714 million noncash decline in our derivative contracts liability the 149 million reduction in our working capital in 2008 resulted from the recognition of a 730 million noncash liability for derivative contracts and lower accounts receivable balances at both businesses related to volume declines which were partially offset by higher inventories and lower accounts payable balances at our electrical products segment and cash deposits of 225 million associated with derivative contracts 

cash provided by operating activities during 2009 was an alltime record of 2676 million compared with 984 million during 2008 and 1854 million during 2007 a significant decline in our working capital needs this year compared with an increase last year and higher earnings explain the majority of the improved 2009 cash flow lower net earnings in 2008 compared with 2007 and the changes in cashrelated working capital accounts described above explain the majority of the decline in 2008 we expect cash provided by operating activities to be between 115 and 125 million in 2010 

our capital expenditures were 570 million in 2009 lower than the 661 million spent in 2008 our capital spending in 2007 was 714 million we are projecting 2010 capital expenditures of between 75 and 85 million and 2010 depreciation and amortization of approximately 75 million 2010 capital spending includes the completion of the construction of the water heater manufacturing plant near bangalore india and the start of construction of a new water treatment manufacturing facility in china 

we have a 425 million multicurrency revolving credit facility with a group of eight banks which expires in february 2011 the facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to 500 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants during all of calendar year 2009 

the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings and it expires on february 17 2011 as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt at december 31 2009 we had available borrowing capacity of 3083 million under this facility we believe that the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future we plan to have the replacement to this facility in place in the third quarter of 2010 and we do not anticipate any problems completing the new facility at this time 

our acquisition of 80 percent of the water treatment business of tianlong holding co ltd of hong kong was completed on november 24 2009 for 767 million we used the record cash flow generated in 2009 to pay for the acquisition and pay down debt our total debt was 2532 million at the end of december 2009 compared with 3348 million at the end of 2008 our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 243 percent at the end of 2009 and 335 percent at the end of 2008 

gsw operated a captive insurance company to provide product liability and general liability insurance to its subsidiary american water heater company american we decided to cover american’s liability exposures with our existing insurance programs and operate the captive in runoff effective july 1 2006 the reinsurance company restricts the amount of capital which must be maintained by the captive at december 31 2009 the restricted amount was 172 million compared with 263 million at the end of 2008 and is included in other noncurrent assets the restricted assets are invested in money market securities 

in february 2007 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program in the amount of one million shares of our common stock during 2007 we completed the repurchase of all one million shares at an average cost of 3662 per share our board approved an additional one million shares to be repurchased under this program at its december 2007 meeting as of december 31 2009 we have not repurchased any shares under the authorization approved in december 2007 

our pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations while we were not required to make a contribution to the plan in 2009 we elected to make a contribution of 508 million we are not required to make a contribution in 2010 however the company is forecasting contributions to the pension plan to be between 25 and 30 million in 2010 and between 40 and 50 million in 2011 for further information on our pension plan see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

we have paid dividends for 70 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 18 years we paid total dividends of 77 per share in 2009 compared with 74 per share in 2008 

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 is as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2009 the liability for uncertain income tax positions was 45 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to the company’s scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments considered firm 

results of operations 

our sales in 2009 were slightly less than 20 billion reflecting a decrease of approximately 140 percent from 2008 sales of 23 billion the decline in sales resulted from lower volume for residential and commercial water heaters in north america and declining market demand at electrical products lower sales at both of our operating units reflect historically low levels of housing starts and reduced commercial construction activity caused by the global recession sales in 2008 were about equal to sales of 231 billion in 2007 as a 282 million increase in sales at our water products segment was more than offset by a 359 million decline in sales in our electrical products segment the higher water products sales were due mostly to increased sales in china and material related price increases which were partially offset by significantly lower residential volume the decline at electrical products resulted primarily from lower unit volumes associated with the weak housing market 

our gross profit margin for 2009 was 251 percent compared to 216 percent in 2008 as both of our operating units experienced increased margins in 2009 the higher margins were due to lower material costs benefits from prior years restructuring activities at electrical products as well as lifo benefits and ongoing cost containment activities at both operations our gross profit margin in 2007 was 222 percent the decline in 2008 margin resulted from lower margins at water products which more than offset increased margins at electrical products the higher margins at electrical products were due to commercial contract improvements including pricing at targeted accounts and repositioning savings the lower margins at water products were caused by higher raw material costs primarily steel and its related effect on warranty costs which were partially offset by improvements in pricing 

selling general and administrative expense sga was 73 million higher in 2009 than in 2008 the increased sga was associated with selling costs to support higher volume at the water products china operation sga was 56 million lower in 2008 than in 2007 as lower product liability expense primarily associated with an adverse verdict in 2007 at water products and lower bad debt provisions at both our product operations more than offset higher sga in support of increased sales at our china water heater operation 

pension expense in 2009 was 83 million compared to 40 million in 2008 and 122 million in 2007 the increase in pension expense from 2008 to 2009 was due to lower investment returns caused by a decline in plan assets due to the market 

  

downturn in 2008 and the associated higher amortization of deferred asset losses the decrease in pension expense from 2007 to 2008 was due to an increase in the discount rate lower amortization of deferred asset losses and the absence of curtailment and other charges of 11 million 

we had pretax restructuring income of 03 million in 2009 and recorded pretax restructuring charges of 111 million and 246 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively our electrical products segment recognized 2009 restructuring income of 16 million resulting from the sale of its shenzhen china electric motor facility as partially offset by moving costs associated with previous plant closures the shenzhen facility was sold to the chinese government which exercised eminent domain relative to a road construction project corporate expense includes 13 million of 2009 restructuring charges the majority of which is associated with the loss on sale of a vacated facility from a previously owned business the majority of the charges in 2008 consisting primarily of severance and asset impairment were associated with the plant closures initiated by electrical products in 2007 and completed in 2008 the 2008 charges also included 19 million of expenses incurred by sico relative to the merger transaction in 2007 228 million of restructuring expense was recognized by electrical products with 120 million of the charge attributed to the closing of our operations in scottsville ky and mebane nc and the write down of other assets the closing of these plants resulted in our hermetic motor assembly operations being consolidated in acuna mexico and suzhou china a pretax charge of 92 million associated with the closing of our motor facility in budapest hungary was also included in the 2007 charge a pretax charge of 16 million was also included in the 2007 electrical products charge for certain other domestic repositioning and asset write down expenses in addition to the 2007 restructuring charges at electrical products we also recognized a 19 million corporate charge related to a previously owned business 

interest expense was 118 million 198 million and 276 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the continuous decline is a result of lower interest rates and lower debt levels 

net other expense was 30 million and 19 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively net other income in 2007 was 12 million interest income on restricted marketable securities declined by 07 million in 2009 and 10 million in 2008 due to the liquidation of short term securities amounting to 89 million and 120 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the remainder of the differential in net other expense is due to increased exchange losses in 2009 and 2008 as foreign currencies continued to strengthen against the us dollar 

our effective tax rate was 248 percent in 2009 261 percent in 2008 and 113 percent in 2007 the 2007 effective rate included a 37 million tax benefit upon completion of tax audits and lapse of statutes of limitations for uncertain tax positions and a 11 million china investment incentive tax benefit also included in the 2007 rate is a 99 million tax benefit associated with the writeoff of the investment in our hungarian subsidiary 

our 2009 net earnings on a gaap basis were 813 million or 339 per share compared with 217 million or 229 per share in 2008 and 304 million or 321 per share in 2007 on a nongaap basis 2009 net earnings were 897 million or 296 per share compared with 819 million or 270 per share in 2008 and 882 million or 285 per share in 2007 please refer to liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of net earnings 

water products 

sales for our water products segment were 138 billion in 2009 or 52 percent lower than sales of 145 billion in 2008 sales at our china water heater operation increased by 345 million or 185 percent to 2211 million in 2009 our strong growth in china as well as improved yearoveryear pricing was more than offset by lower residential and commercial volume in north america reflecting continuing softness in the domestic housing market and a slowdown in the commercial water heater business sales in 2008 increased modestly over sales of 142 billion in 2007 while 2008 sales at our china water heater operation increased by 401 million sales for residential water heaters were significantly lower in 2008 and partially offset the growth in china 

operating earnings for water products were 1489 million in 2009 or 105 percent higher than earnings of 1347 million in 2008 the improvement in 2009 earnings resulted from increased higher margin china volumes continued aggressive cost reduction programs and lower material costs operating earnings of 1347 million in 2008 were 102 percent lower than earnings of 1500 million in 2007 the impact of growth in china and lower sga was more than offset by lower residential volume and higher costs for raw materials and components which were not recovered with price increases 

  

electrical products 

sales for our electrical products segment in 2009 were 6204 million or 277 percent lower than 2008 as a result of weak residential and commercial construction markets due to the global recession sales in 2008 of 8581 million were 40 percent lower than 2007 in 2008 increased selling prices to offset higher costs for raw materials were more than offset by lower unit volume caused by the weak housing market as well as customer inventory reductions at the end of the year 

operating earnings at our electrical products segment were 325 million in 2009 compared with 391 million in 2008 the lower earnings were due to significant volume declines which were partially offset by repositioning savings cost reduction activities and lower raw material and restructuring charges additionally the 2009 earnings included a 66 million incremental favorable lifo adjustment net of lower absorption of fixed costs resulting from substantial reductions in inventory levels also included in 2009 earnings was net restructuring income of 16 million as mentioned previously in the discussion of consolidated restructuring costs operating earnings of 391 million in 2008 compared with 231 million in 2007 due to a decrease in restructuring charges from 228 million in 2007 to 87 million in 2008 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we constantly reevaluate these significant factors and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an armslength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct annual thorough and competent valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed on a periodic basis at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates 

  

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business a majority of these claims involve our water products business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year as of december 31 2009 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million per occurrence 

gsw insurance coverage included selfinsurance retentions that varied by business segment and by year effective april 3 2006 gsw maintained a 250 million aggregate loss retention through selfinsurance and captive insurance company coverage gsw claims occurring on or after july 1 2006 are covered under the company’s insurance program 

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also use an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected rate of return on plan assets is 875 percent in 2009 unchanged from 2008 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs increased from 650 percent in 2008 to 660 percent in 2009 in 2010 the rate of return on plan assets is 875 percent and the discount rate is 580 percent 

in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluate our pension plan’s target asset allocation the historical longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is between 60 to 70 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2009 was 60 percent to equity managers 30 percent to bond managers five percent to private equity managers and the remainder in money market instruments we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical 10year and 25year compounded annualized returns are 36 percent and 107 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the historical longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 875 percent expected return on assets for 2010 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 were based on the hewitt top quartile yield curve htq which was designed by hewitt associates to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the htq is a hypothetical double a yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates each bond issue underlying the htq is required to have a rating of aa or better by moody’s investor service inc or a rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s because of the volatile bond market we adjusted our discount rate as of december 31 2008 to take into account the effect of bonds that were on credit watch on december 31 2008 and were subsequently downgraded below a aa rating before january 15 2009 the discount rates determined on the basis described above were 580 percent 660 percent and 650 percent at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

we estimate that we will recognize approximately 130 million of pension expense in 2010 compared to 83 million in 2009 lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2010 by approximately 16 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2010 net pension expense by approximately 11 million 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting codification statement “asc” subtopic 85510 formerly statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 165 “subsequent events” subtopic 85510 addresses the types and timing of events that should be reported in the financial statements for events that occur between the balance sheet date and the date the financial statements are issued or available to be issued we reviewed events for possible inclusion in the financial statements through our filing date of february 26 2010 

in march 2008 the fasb issued asc subtopic 81510 “derivatives and hedging” subtopic 81510 formerly sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb no 133” is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows asc 81510 applies to all derivative instruments within the scope of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas 133” it also applies to nonderivative hedging instruments and all hedged items designated and qualifying under sfas 133 and is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 with early application encouraged this pronouncement encourages but does not require comparative disclosures for periods prior to its initial adoption we adopted asc 81510 on january 1 2009 adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows see note 1 for further discussion 

in december 2007 the fasb issued asc subtopic 8101065 “consolidations” formerly sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51” this pronouncement changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity this new consolidation method changes the accounting for transactions with minority interest holders and is effective beginning in 2009 we adopted asc 8101065 on january 1 2009 adoption of this statement has impacted our accounting for the sico transaction as well as the acquisition of tianlong holding co ltd and has been incorporated in the accompanying financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued asc subtopic 80510 “business combinations” formerly sfas no 141r asc 80510 requires us to continue to follow prior guidance for certain aspects of business combinations with additional guidance provided defining the acquirer recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree assets and liabilities arising from contingencies defining a bargain purchase and recognizing and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase in addition certain transaction costs previously capitalized as part of the purchase price will be expensed as incurred also under asc 80510 adjustments associated with changes in tax contingencies that occur after the one year measurement period are recorded as adjustments to income this statement is effective for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after december 15 2008 however the guidance in this standard regarding the treatment of income tax contingencies is retrospective to business combinations completed prior to january 1 2009 we have adopted asc 80510 on january 1 2009 and incorporated the impact of this statement in the accounting for the sico transaction and the acquisition of tianlong holding co ltd 

outlook 

there are a number of positive trends going into 2010 most notably continued growth in china and india a full year of our new water treatment business and evidence of improved demand in many of our global motor markets we remain cautious because of continued weakness in new commercial construction activity and rising commodity costs consequently we expect earnings per share to be in the range of 295 to 325 in 2010 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2009 and are not expected to be material in any single year we have accrued amounts associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with 

  

such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency and certain commodities we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward and futures contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

commodity risks include raw material price fluctuations we use futures contracts to fix the cost of our expected needs for certain raw materials ie copper and aluminum with the objective of reducing price risk futures contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume levels which approximate expected usage at december 31 2009 we had commodity futures contracts amounting to 335 million of commodity purchases a hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity price of such contracts would have a potential impact of 34 million it is important to note that gains and losses from our futures contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase transactions being hedged 

in addition we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2009 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 1198 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 120 million it is important to note that gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2009 we had 917 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 08 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 01 million 

smith investment company transaction 

on december 9 2008 we entered into a merger agreement with our largest stockholder smith investment company sico providing for sico to become a whollyowned subsidiary of our company in a tax free exchange as a result of the merger the stockholders of sico now own shares of our company directly rather than through sico pursuant to the merger agreement stockholders of sico received 2396 shares of our class a common stock and 0463 shares of our common stock for each share of sico they held subject to a portion of the common stock being placed in escrow to satisfy indemnity claims that we may have under the merger agreement prior to the merger sico owned approximately 979 percent of our outstanding class a common stock and approximately 71 of our outstanding common stock the merger agreement was approved by our stockholders on april 14 2009 and was consummated on april 22 2009

the following table summarizes our sales by reporting segment this segment summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item 8 in this document 

 

 water products 

in our water products business sales increased 2 percent or 28 million in 2008 over the prior year a 27 percent increase in sales of water heaters in china and increased pricing that partially covered higher raw material costs helped offset significantly lower residential volumes 

we serve residential commercial and industrial end markets with a broad range of products including 

residential gas and electric water heaters  our residential water heaters come in sizes ranging from twogallon pointofuse models to 120gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges we offer electric natural gas and liquid propane models as well as solar booster tanks and gas tankless units for today’s energy efficient homes north american residential water heater sales in 2008 were approximately 945 million or 65 percent of segment revenues 

commercial standard and specialty water heaters our gas oil and electric water heaters come in capacities ranging from 6 gallons to 600 gallons and are used by customers who require a consistent economical source of hot water typical applications include restaurants hotels and motels laundries car washes and small businesses 

a significant portion of our water products business is derived from the replacement of existing product and it is believed that the sale of product to the north american residential new housing construction market represents approximately 15 percent of the segment’s total residential water heater sales our water products business also manufactures coppertube boilers and expansion tanks and related products and parts 

we are the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in north america and we have a leading share in both the residential and commercial segments of the market in the commercial market segment we believe our comprehensive product line as well as our highefficiency products give us a competitive advantage in this highermargin segment of the water heating industry as the leader in the residential water heating market segment we offer an extensive line of highefficiency gas and electric models 

our water products wholesale distribution channel includes more than 1100 independent wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 4600 selling locations serving residential commercial and industrial markets we also sell our residential 

  

water heaters through the retail channel in this channel our customers include five of the seven largest national hardware and home center chains including longstanding private label relationships with both lowes and sears roebuck and co 

we entered the chinese water heater market through a joint venture in 1995 buying out our partner three years later since that time we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building brand recognition in the chinese residential and commercial markets in 2008 the company generated sales of 187 million in china an increase of 27 percent compared with 2007 we believe we are one of the top two suppliers of water heaters to the residential market in china 

in 2008 we entered the india market by importing units specifically designed for india from our nanjing china facility we established a sales office and started the land acquisition process for a manufacturing plant near bangalore india we expect to begin manufacturing water heaters in india in the second quarter of 2010 

we sell our water heating products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design quality of products and services performance and price our principal domestic water heating competitors include rheem manufacturing company inc bradfordwhite corporation and lochinvar corporation our primary competitor in china is haier appliances a chinese company but we also compete with ariston siemens and midea in the electric water heater market and rinnai and noritz in the gas instantaneous water heater market additionally we compete with numerous other chinese private and stateowned water heater and boiler manufacturing companies 

electrical products 

in our electrical products business volume declines more than offset higher prices related to higher raw material costs sales in the segment declined four percent in 2008 or approximately 36 million to 858 million compared with 2007 unit volume sales were negatively impacted by the weak housing market and customer inventory reductions at the end of the year 

we are one of the four largest manufacturers of electric motors in north america we offer a comprehensive line of hermetic motors fractional horsepower ac and dc motors and integral horsepower motors ranging in size from subfractional c – frame ventilation motors up to 1320 horsepower hermetic and 400 horsepower integral motors we believe our extensive product offerings give us an advantage in our targeted markets allowing us to serve a wide range of our customer’s electric motor needs 

our motors are used in a wide range of targeted residential and commercial applications including hermetic motors that are sold worldwide to manufacturers of air conditioning and commercial refrigeration compressors fractional horsepower fan motors used in furnaces air conditioners and blowers fractional horsepower motors for pumps for home water systems swimming pools hot tubs and spas fractional horsepower motors used in other consumer products such as garage door openers and integral horsepower ac and dc motors for industrial and commercial applications sales to the north american original equipment manufacturers oem heating ventilating air conditioning and refrigeration market account for approximately 33 percent of segment sales approximately 80 percent of our 2008 segment sales were to oems in a diverse mix of industries with the remainder of sales sold through aftermarket or distribution channels we believe that at least 25 percent of our total segment sales were attributable to products used outside of the united states a significant portion of our electrical products business is derived from the replacement of existing product and it is believed that the sale of product to the residential new housing construction market in north america represents approximately 25 percent of the segment’s total sales 

to remain a leader in this highly competitive industry we are committed to being a lowcost supplier of electric motors since 2001 we have undertaken initiatives to accelerate costreduction in our motor operations to enhance our competitive position these initiatives included the closure of nine us facilities as well as our operations in budapest hungary bray ireland and taizhou china transferring the majority of related production to our lower cost operations in mexico and china 

at the end of the third quarter of 2007 we announced that we would close our operations in scottsville ky and mebane nc and consolidate our hermetic motor assembly operations in acuna mexico and suzhou china we transferred the work at both hermetic motor facilities in the fourth quarter of 2008 in addition we also announced the closing of our motor manufacturing facility in budapest hungary and transfer of the remaining production to china for all of 2007 the restructuring expense at electrical products totaled 228 million before taxes or 89 million after taxes equivalent to 29 per share included in the 2007 after tax amount was a 99 million tax benefit associated with the writeoff of the investment in our hungarian subsidiary in 2008 we recorded an additional pretax restructuring charge of approximately 87 million associated with the three plant closings mentioned above and repositioning at juarez mexico equivalent to 53 million after taxes or approximately 18 per share 

  

in november of 2005 we completed our fourth motor acquisition in china with the purchase of yueyang zhongmin special electrical machinery co ltd yueyang located in hunan province yueyang manufactures large hermetic motors used in commercial air conditioning applications 

we sell our electric motor products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design quality of products and services performance and price our principal competitors in the electric motor industry are emerson electric co regal beloit corporation and baldor electric company 

raw material 

raw materials for our manufacturing operations which consist primarily of steel copper and aluminum are generally available from several sources in adequate quantities we typically hedge a portion of our annual copper and aluminum purchases to protect against price volatility in addition a portion of electrical products customers are contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in certain of our raw material prices global demand pressures have also resulted in significant volatility in steel copper and aluminum costs 

research and development 

in order to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin and at our operating units total expenditures for research and development in 2008 2007 and 2006 were 485 478 and 423 million respectively 

patents and trademarks

employees 

our company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 15350 employees as of december 31 2008 

backlog 

due to the shortcycle nature of our businesses none of our operations sustain significant backlogs 

environmental laws 

our operations are governed by a variety of federal state and local laws intended to protect the environment while environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures compliance with the environmental laws has not had and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of our company see item 3

 item 1a – risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

 

 the us economy is currently in a recession and it has now spread to other geographic areas in which we operate the global credit and capital markets troubles threaten to extend the depth and duration of the recession a continuation or deepening of the global economic downturn could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell a delay in purchases increased price competition and slower adoption of energy efficient products which could negatively impact our profitability andor cash flow in addition the current economic conditions including the credit market conditions could negatively impact our vendors and customers which could result in an increase in bad debt expense customer and vendor bankruptcies interruption or delay in supply of materials and increased material prices which could negatively impact our ability to distribute market and sell our products and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we sell a portion of our products for new residential and commercial construction the strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and business investment which are a function of many factors beyond our control including interest rates employment levels availability of credit and consumer confidence further downturns in the new construction markets we serve could result in lower revenues and lower profitability new housing starts declined in 2007 and 2008 and may continue at the lower levels or decline further commercial construction activity which has been high in recent years could continue the decline that began in the second half of 2008 we believe that approximately 15 percent of our water products and 25 percent of our electrical products businesses respectively are affected by changes in the residential housing construction markets furthermore though we believe that the majority of the commercial business we serve is for replacement we could also be affected by changes in the commercial construction market 

 

 we have experienced above average growth in sales in china for both our water products and electrical products segments if the chinese economy were to experience a significant slowdown it could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 net sales to our four largest customers represented approximately 26 percent of 2008 net sales we expect that customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future in light of the global economic downturn our dependence on sales from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may in the future shift their 

  

purchases of products to our competitors or to other sources the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or our inability to execute on pricing actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design quality of products and services product performance maintenance costs and price we compete against manufacturers located in the united states and throughout the world we also face potential competition from some oems to whom we sell our electrical products and from our customers and the end users of our products who continually assess any costs that could be reduced by vertically integrating or using alternate sources for the products we manufacture some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing and distribution resources than we have we cannot assure that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 a significant portion of our 2008 net sales were attributable to products manufactured outside of the united states principally in mexico and china approximately 5700 of our 15350 total employees and 14 of our 35 manufacturing facilities are located in mexico approximately 4500 employees and five manufacturing facilities are located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade restrictions the impact of foreign government regulations and the effects of income and withholding tax governmental expropriation and differences in business practices we may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenue unfavorable changes in the political regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 almost all of our electric motor manufacturing productive labor hours are incurred in mexico and china the peso based costs we incur manufacturing these products are directly related to changes in labor costs in mexico and fluctuations in exchange rates of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar the labor costs we incur are measured in us dollars and based on the cost of labor in mexican pesos historically mexico has had higher wage inflation than the united states that inflation does not adversely affect our costs when there is a corresponding decrease in the value of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar however during periods in which the value of the mexican peso increases or remains stable relative to the us dollar higher wage inflation in mexico results in an increase in our labor costs manufacturing and material costs we incur in china are principally incurred in chinese rmb if the rmb continues to strengthen against the us dollar our costs would increase 

 

 the market price for certain key materials we purchase eg steel copper aluminum diesel fuel and natural gas have been very volatile in the recent past while our company periodically enters into futures contracts to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases principally copper and aluminum significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in any customer recovery of increased material costs which could negatively impact our profitability as of december 31 2008 the company had entered into commodity and foreign exchange contracts that totaled losses of 71 million even though a portion of these losses can contractually be passed on to customers the remaining amount could lead to lower operating earnings if we are unable to recover these costs from customers or because of reduced sales we are unable to use the materials or foreign currency in addition in some cases we are dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and 

  

components required in the manufacture of our product a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase cost which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 due to the negative investment returns in 2008 the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by 264 million at december 31 2008 beginning in 2008 the minimum required contribution equals the target normal cost plus a seven year amortization of any funding shortfall offset by any erisa credit balance as the company could utilize its credit balance the required contribution in 2009 is approximately 18 million however the company is forecasting contributions of between 18 to 35 million and 40 to 50 million in 2009 and 2010 respectively among the key assumptions inherent in the actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially the size of future required pension contributions could result in us dedicating a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making the contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing the company 

 

 our total assets include significant goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at one or more of our businesses does not meet expectations we may be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill may affect our ability to maintain the required debttocapital ratio existing under our debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 acquisitions we have made since 1997 have had a significant impact on our results of operations while we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms utilize cash flow from operations obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future if we complete any future acquisitions then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing we cannot assure you that future acquisitions will not have a material adverse affect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our water heater and electric motor products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will successfully weather the current economic downturn in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 in addition to issuing commercial paper and utilizing short term credit lines we rely on our 425 million revolving credit facility to support our daily operations the global credit markets tightened considerably in 2008 if these conditions remain unchanged or worsen our replacement credit facility may have less favorable terms than the facility we have now in particular the new facility could have higher borrowing costs and more restrictive covenants and depending on banks willingness to lend the facility could be smaller in size a credit facility with less favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory regulatory and industry standards and requirements these include energy efficiency climate emissions labeling and safetyrelated requirements while we believe our products are currently some of the most efficient safest and environmentfriendly products available a significant change to these regulatory requirements whether federal state or local or otherwise to industry standards could substantially increase manufacturing costs impact the size and timing of demand for our products or put us at a competitive disadvantage any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

 we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock currently are entitled as a class to elect only 25 percent of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors as of december 31 2008 smith investment company smith investment effectively controlled the right to elect 70 percent of our board of directors 7 of 10 because it beneficially owned approximately 98 percent of our class a common stock as of december 31 2008 smith investment beneficially owned approximately 32 percent of the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock and class a common stock due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and shares of our class a common stock smith investment is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – other matters – smith investment company transaction” for a description of a proposed merger pursuant to which smith investment would become our subsidiary and a description of certain proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation that stockholders will consider and that smith investment has committed to vote to approve however assuming such merger is completed certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit smith family are likely to have the ability to influence all matters requiring stockholder approval as described in more detail below the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and our class a common stock could have the effect of delaying deterring or preventing a change of control 

 

 the merger agreement pursuant to which smith investment would become our subsidiary contemplates that certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit smith family may enter into a voting trust agreement following the completion of the merger with respect to shares of our class a common stock and shares of our common stock they receive in the merger after giving effect to the merger these members of the smith family are expected to own approximately 414 of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and common stock taken together as a single class and approximately 516 of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock as a separate class this ownership position may increase if other members of the smith family enter into the voting trust agreement and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our class a common stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our common stock accordingly after the merger the smith family members who enter into the voting trust agreement would collectively have the ability to influence the election of our class a directors and other matters requiring stockholder approval in the same manner that smith investment can currently influence such matters the voting trust agreement provides that in the event one 

  

of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our class a common stock such shares of our class a common stock are automatically exchanged for shares of our common stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust in addition the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our class a common stock and our common stock proposed to be withdrawn or transferred from the trust as a result the smith family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement may have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the smith family decide to transfer their shares

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

we achieved net earnings of 819 million or 270 per share in 2008 compared with 882 million or 285 per share in 2007 and 765 million or 247 per share in 2006 net earnings recorded in 2008 were lower than 2007 due to lower sales of u s residential product higher raw material costs only partially offset by price increases higher product warranty costs at our water products segment primarily as a result of higher steel costs and a higher tax rate these factors were partially offset by lower restructuring costs in our electrical products segment another strong year for our china water heater business and lower product liability costs in our water heater business net earnings recorded in 2007 were higher than 2006 due to a full year of the gsw business acquired in april 2006 higher sales of commercial product solid growth at our china water heater operation and a lower effective tax rate these improvements were partially offset by higher sga expenses and restructuring charges in 2007 compared with 2006 our individual segment performance will be discussed later in this section 

our working capital was 2763 million at december 31 2008 compared with 2950 million and 3227 million at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively the 187 million reduction in our working capital in 2008 compared with 2007 resulted from the recognition of a noncash 730 million liability for derivative contracts and lower accounts receivable balances at both businesses related to volume declines which were partially offset by higher inventories and lower accounts payable balances at our electrical products segment and cash deposits of 225 million associated with derivative contracts the 277 million reduction in our working capital in 2007 compared with 2006 was a result of lower inventories in our electrical products segment higher accounts payable balances in both businesses were offset by an increase in our water products segment’s accounts receivable balances 

cash provided by operating activities during 2008 was 1066 million compared with 1905 million during 2007 and 1288 million during 2006 lower net earnings in 2008 compared with 2007 and the changes in cashrelated working capital accounts described above explain the majority of the decline higher net earnings in 2007 compared with 2006 combined with higher depreciation and amortization and the working capital decrease described above explain the 617 million year over year improvement in our cash flow we expect cash provided by operating activities to be between 140 and 160 million in 2009 

our capital expenditures were 661 million in 2008 lower than the 714 million spent in 2007 our capital spending in 2006 was 682 million we are projecting 2009 capital expenditures of between 75 and 85 million and 2009 depreciation and amortization of approximately 70 million 2009 capital spending includes the construction of the water heater manufacturing plant near bangalore india and the completion of the expansion of our nanjing china water heater operations 

in february 2006 we completed a 425 million multicurrency five year revolving credit facility with a group of eight banks the facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to 500 million if certain conditions including lender approval are satisfied borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test and we were in compliance with the covenants during all of calendar year 2008 

the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings and it expires on february 17 2011 as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt at december 31 2008 we had available borrowing capacity of 2469 million under this facility we believe that the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

at this point in time our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future there can be no assurance however that the cost of future borrowings on our credit facilities will not be impacted by the ongoing capital market disruptions 

our total debt was 3348 million at the end of december 2008 compared with 3952 million at the end of 2007 our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 34 percent at the end of 2008 the same as at the end of 2007 

  

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 is as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2008 the liability for uncertain income tax positions was 55 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to the company’s scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments considered firm the amounts in the table above for commodity and foreign currency contracts represent the costs to liquidate the contracts as of december 31 2008 

gsw operated a captive insurance company to provide product liability and general liability insurance to its subsidiary american water heater company american we decided to cover american’s liability exposures with our existing insurance programs and operate the captive in runoff effective july 1 2006 the reinsurance company restricts the amount of capital which must be maintained by the captive at december 31 2008 the restricted amount was 263 million compared with 389 million at the end of 2007 and is included in other noncurrent assets the restricted assets are invested in money market securities 

in february 2007 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program in the amount of one million shares of our common stock during 2007 we completed the repurchase of all one million shares at an average cost of 3662 per share our board approved an additional one million shares to be repurchased under this program at its december 2007 meeting as of december 31 2008 we have not repurchased any shares under the authorization approved in december 2007 

our pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations while we were not required to make a contribution to the plan in 2008 we elected to make a contribution of 173 million we are required to make a contribution of approximately 18 million in 2009 the company is forecasting contributions to the pension plan to be between 18 and 35 million in 2009 and between 40 and 50 million in 2010 for further information on our pension plan see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have paid dividends for 69 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 17 years we paid total dividends of 74 per share in 2008 compared with 70 per share in 2007 

results of operations 

our sales in 2008 were 23 billion about equal to sales in 2007 as a 282 million increase in sales in our water products segment was more than offset by a 359 million decline in sales in our electrical products segment the higher water products sales were due mostly to increased sales in china and material related price increases which were partially offset by significantly lower residential volume the decline at electrical products resulted primarily from lower unit volumes associated with the weak housing market sales in 2007 were 231 billion an increase of 1508 million or 70 percent from sales of 216 billion in 2006 the sales increase occurred in our water products segment and was due to a full year of the gsw business acquired in april 2006 which added 128 million of sales in the first quarter of 2007 as well as increased sales 

  

of commercial water heaters and higher sales in china sales for electrical products declined 119 million from 9059 million in 2006 to 8940 million in 2007 as improved pricing was more than offset by lower volume 

our gross profit margin for 2008 was 216 percent compared to 222 percent in 2007 as increased margins at electrical products were more than offset by lower margins at water products the higher margins at electrical products resulted from commercial contract improvements including pricing at targeted accounts and repositioning savings the lower margins at water products were caused by higher raw material costs primarily steel and its related effect on warranty costs which were partially offset by improvements in pricing our gross profit margin for 2006 was 215 percent the improved margins in 2007 were due mostly to sales of higher margin products in our water products segment 

selling general and administrative expense sga was 56 million lower in 2008 than in 2007 as lower product liability expense primarily associated with an adverse verdict in 2007 at water products and lower bad debt provisions at both our product operations more than offset higher sga in support of increased sales at our china water heater operation the increase in sga of 390 million from 2006 to 2007 was due to higher selling and advertising costs to support increased sales at our water heater segment and included 152 million of first quarter sga attributable to the gsw acquisition 

pension expense in 2008 was 40 million compared to 122 million in 2007 and 119 million in 2006 the decrease in pension expense from 2007 to 2008 was due to an increase in the discount rate lower amortization of deferred asset losses and the absence of curtailment and other charges of 11 million the increase in pension expense from 2006 to 2007 was due to curtailment and other charges as partially offset by lower amortization of deferred asset losses 

pretax restructuring charges were 92 million 247 million and 96 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the majority of the charges incurred in 2008 consisting primarily of severance and asset impairment were associated with the plant closures initiated by our electrical products segment in 2007 and completed in 2008 in 2007 228 million of restructuring expense was recognized by electrical products with 120 million of the charge attributed to the closing of our operations in scottsville ky and mebane nc and the write down of other assets the closing of these plants resulted in our hermetic motor assembly operations being consolidated in acuna mexico and suzhou china a pretax charge of 92 million associated with the closing of our motor facility in budapest hungary was also included in the 2007 charge a pretax charge of 16 million was also included in the 2007 electrical products charge for certain other domestic repositioning and asset write down expenses in addition to the 2007 restructuring charges at electrical products we also recognized a 19 million corporate charge related to a previously owned business in 2006 89 million of the 96 million restructuring charge was recognized by electrical products most of which was related to the closure of our mcminnville tn motor fabrication plant completed in the first quarter of 2007 and the closure of our motor operation in taizhou china in the fourth quarter of 2006 we do not have any current restructuring plans 

interest expense decreased from 267 million in 2007 to 192 million in 2008 as a result of lower interest rates and debt interest expense increased from 249 million in 2006 to 267 million in 2007 due to gsw acquisition related financing costs incurred for a full year in 2007 versus only nine months in 2006 

in 2008 net other expense of 16 million compared to net other income of 09 million the 25 million differential is due to 10 million lower interest income on restricted marketable securities due to liquidation of 120 million of shortterm securities in the second quarter of 2008 with the remainder due to exchange losses as foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar in 2007 net other income of 09 million compared to net other expense of 06 million in 2006 the differential was due to 05 million of interest income on restricted marketable securities in the first quarter of 2007 with the remainder due to exchange gains associated with us dollar purchases made by our canadian operations 

our effective tax rate was 254 percent in 2008 117 percent in 2007 and 273 percent in 2006 the 2007 effective rate included a 37 million tax benefit upon completion of tax audits and lapse of statutes of limitations and a 11 million china investment incentive tax benefit also included in the 2007 rate is a 99 million tax benefit associated with the writeoff of the investment in our hungarian subsidiary 

our 2008 net earnings were 819 million or 270 per share compared with 882 million or 285 per share in 2007 and 765 million or 247 per share in 2006 

  

water products 

sales for our water products segment were 145 billion in 2008 a modest increase over sales of 142 billion in 2007 sales at our china water heater operation increased by 401 million in 2008 despite price increases to compensate for higher material costs sales for residential water heaters were significantly lower in 2008 and partially offset the growth in china sales in 2007 were 1623 million higher than sales of 126 billion in 2006 the increase was due to a full year of the gsw business acquired in april 2006 which added 1280 million of sales in the first quarter of 2007 a 301 million increase in sales at our china operation and increased sales of commercial water heaters 

operating earnings for water products were 1347 million in 2008 or 102 percent lower than earnings of 1500 million in 2007 the impact of growth in china and lower sga was more than offset by lower residential volume and higher costs for raw materials and components which were not recovered with price increases operating earnings of 1500 million in 2007 were 225 percent higher than earnings of 1224 million in 2006 the increase in earnings was due to an additional three months of gsw earnings higher earnings in china and sales of higher margin products all of which offset lower residential water heater volume 

electrical products 

sales in our electrical products segment in 2008 were 8581 million or 40 percent lower than 2007 increased selling prices to offset higher costs for raw materials were more than offset by lower unit volume caused by the weak housing market as well as customer inventory reductions at the end of the year sales in 2007 of 8940 million were 13 percent lower than 2006 similar to 2008 the favorable impact of materials related pricing actions was more than offset by the negative impact of a weak housing market additionally lower volume in the residential hermetic and pump motor markets more than offset improved sales in the commercial hermetic and distribution market segments 

operating earnings at our electrical products segment were 391 million in 2008 compared with 231 million in 2007 the majority of the increase in earnings was due to a decrease in restructuring charges from 228 million in 2007 to 87 million in 2008 operating earnings in 2007 were 250 million lower than earnings of 481 million in 2006 due to an increase in restructuring charges of 139 million and lower unit volumes please refer to the previous discussion on restructuring charges for additional details 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we constantly reevaluate these significant factors and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an armslength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct annual thorough and competent valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment 

  

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed on a periodic basis at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience while our warranty costs have historically been within its calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business a majority of these claims involve our water products business we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year as of december 31 2008 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million per occurrence 

gsw insurance coverage included selfinsurance retentions that varied by business segment and by year effective april 3 2006 gsw maintained a 250 million aggregate loss retention through selfinsurance and captive insurance company coverage gsw claims occurring on or after july 1 2006 are covered under the company’s insurance program 

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also use an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumptions for the expected rate of return on plan assets is 875 percent in 2008 unchanged from 2007 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs increased from 590 percent in 2007 to 650 percent in 2008 in 2009 the rate of return on plan assets is 875 percent and the discount rate is 660 percent 

in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluate our pension plan’s target asset allocation the historical longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is between 60 to 70 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers due to market fluctuations our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2008 was 55 percent to equity managers 36 percent to bond managers six percent to private equity managers and the remainder in money market instruments we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical 10year and 25year compounded annualized returns are 40 percent and 102 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the historical longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 875 percent expected return on assets for 2009 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 were based on the hewitt top quartile yield curve htq which was designed by hewitt associates to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the htq is a hypothetical double a yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates each bond issue underlying the htq is required to have a rating of aa or better by moody’s investor service inc or a rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s because of the volatile bond market we adjusted our discount rate as of december 31 2008 to take into account the effect of bonds that were on credit watch on december 31 2008 and were subsequently downgraded below a aa rating before january 15 2009 the discount rates 

  

determined on the basis described above were 660 percent 650 percent and 590 percent at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

we estimate that we will recognize approximately 100 million of pension expense in 2009 compared to 40 million in 2008 lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2009 by approximately 17 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2009 net pension expense by approximately 13 million 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in march 2008 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb no 133” “sfas 161” sfas 161 is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas 161 applies to all derivative instruments within the scope of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas 133” sfas 161 also applies to nonderivative hedging instruments and all hedged items designated and qualifying under sfas 133 sfas 161 is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 with early application encouraged sfas 161 encourages but does not require comparative disclosures for periods prior to its initial adoption we will adopt sfas 161 on january 1 2009 and are currently evaluating the potential impact on our financial statements when implemented 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51” “sfas 160” sfas 160 changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity this new consolidation method changes the accounting for transactions with minority interest holders sfas 160 is effective beginning in 2009 adoption of this statement will impact our accounting for any future transactions which include a noncontrolling interest 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” “sfas 141r” sfas 141r requires us to continue to follow the guidance in sfas 141 for certain aspects of business combinations with additional guidance provided defining the acquirer recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree assets and liabilities arising from contingencies defining a bargain purchase and recognizing and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase in addition certain transaction costs previously capitalized as part of the purchase price will be expensed as incurred also under sfas 141r adjustments associated with changes in tax contingencies that occur after the one year measurement period are recorded as adjustments to income this statement is effective for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after december 15 2008 however the guidance in this standard regarding the treatment of income tax contingencies is retrospective to business combinations completed prior to january 1 2009 we will adopt sfas 141r for any business combinations occurring at or subsequent to january 1 2009 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 “sfas 159” which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions we adopted sfas 159 on january 1 2008 adoption of this statement did not have an affect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability as discussed in footnote 1 we adopted sfas 157 on january 1 2008 adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

outlook 

given the deteriorating global economic environment that intensified during the fourth quarter we are forecasting significantly lower volumes for both our residential and commercial businesses in both operating companies in addition we expect an increase of more than 6 million in pension expense 

also there are a number of factors that we believe will contribute to earnings this year including improvement in water heater pricing continued growth—although at a slower rate—in china and savings from the restructuring initiative at electrical products company at the same time we continue to reduce cost throughout our operations we announced in january 2009 a companywide workforce reduction program for our salaried workforce 

notwithstanding these factors which could improve earnings the weak economy will challenge us throughout the year and consequently we expect 2009 earnings will be in a range between 240 and 260 per share 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2008 and are not expected to be material in any single year we have accrued amounts associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency and certain commodities we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward and futures contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

commodity risks include raw material price fluctuations we use futures contracts to fix the cost of our expected needs for certain raw materials ie copper and aluminum with the objective of reducing price risk futures contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume levels which approximate expected usage at december 31 2008 we had commodity futures contracts amounting to 539 million of commodity purchases a hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity price of such contracts would have a potential impact of 54 million it is important to note that gains and losses from our futures contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase transactions being hedged 

in addition we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2008 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 1964 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 196 million it is important to note that gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2008 we had 1596 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 18 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 03 million 

  

smith investment company transaction 

on december 9 2008 we entered into a merger agreement with our largest stockholder smith investment company pursuant to which smith investment would become our whollyowned subsidiary assuming the merger is completed the stockholders of smith investment will own our shares directly rather than through smith investment smith investment owns approximately 979 percent of our outstanding class a common stock and approximately 71 percent of our outstanding common stock 

we and our stockholders are expected to benefit from the merger because its terms provide for 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation also provide for an increase solely for purposes of completing the merger in the total number of authorized shares of our class a common stock that we can issue from 14000000 shares to 22667252 shares 

certain members of the smith family have agreed to vote their shares to approve the merger agreement at a meeting of smith investment stockholders similarly smith investment has agreed to vote its shares to approve the merger agreement and the amendments to our certificate of incorporation at a meeting of our stockholders these stockholders have enough votes to ensure approval of the transaction at the respective stockholders meetings of our company and smith investment 

in addition to receipt of approval of stockholders of our company and smith investment the merger is subject to receipt of a favorable letter ruling from the internal revenue service the effectiveness of a registration statement covering our shares to be issued to the smith investment stockholders and other customary closing conditions under the terms of the agreement smith investment will reimburse us for substantially all of its transactionrelated expenses in addition a portion of our common stock to be issued to the smith investment stockholders having a market value of 15 million as of the effective time of the merger will be placed in escrow to satisfy indemnification claims if any by us in connection with the transaction we expect the merger to close by the end of the second quarter of 2009 

the pending transaction between a o smith and sico will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition with sico as the accounting acquirer and a o smith as the accounting acquiree which is the surviving entity for legal purposes as this is a common control transaction under sfas 141r business combinations the transaction will be accounted for as an equity transaction under sfas 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51 the acquisition of a noncontrolling interest will not require purchase accounting 

furthermore because sico is treated as the continuing reporting entity for accounting purposes the reports filed by a o smith as the surviving corporation in the transaction after the date of the transaction will parallel the financial reporting required under united states generally accepted accounting principles and sec reporting rules as if sico were the legal successor to its reporting obligation as of the date of the transaction accordingly prior period financial information presented in the a o smith financial statements will reflect the historical activity of sico

the following table summarizes our sales by reporting segment this segment summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item 8 in this document 

 

 water products 

in our water products business sales increased 13 percent or 162 million in 2007 over the prior year due to a full year of the gsw business acquired in april 2006 which added 128 million in sales in the first quarter of 2007 sales growth of 26 percent in china which added 30 million in sales and increased sales of commercial water heaters excluding the incremental sales added by the gsw acquisition sales in the residential market segment were lower in 2007 than in 2006 

we serve residential commercial and industrial end markets with a broad range of products including 

residential gas and electric water heaters  our residential water heaters come in sizes ranging from twogallon pointofuse models to 120gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges we offer traditional atmospheric and tankless water heaters as well as directvented powervented and condensing models for today’s energy efficient homes north american residential water heater sales in 2007 were approximately 990 million or 70 percent of segment revenues 

standard commercial water heaters our gas oil and electric water heaters come in capacities ranging from 6 gallons to 130 gallons and are used by customers who require a consistent economical source of hot water typical applications include restaurants hotels and motels laundries car washes and small businesses 

a significant portion of our water products business is derived from the replacement of existing product and it is believed that the sale of product to the north american residential new housing construction market represents approximately 15 percent of the segment’s total sales our water products business also manufactures and markets specialty commercial water heaters coppertube boilers expansion tanks and related products and parts 

we are the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in north america and we have a leading share in both the residential and commercial segments of the market in the commercial market segment we believe our comprehensive product line gives us a competitive advantage in this highermargin segment of the water heating industry as the leader in the residential water heating market segment we offer an extensive line of highefficiency gas and electric models 

our water products wholesale distribution channel includes more than 1250 independent wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 5800 selling locations serving residential commercial and industrial markets we also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel in this channel our customers include five of the seven largest national hardware and home center chains including longstanding private label relationships with both lowes and sears roebuck and co 

  

we entered the chinese water heater market through a joint venture in 1995 buying out our partner three years later since that time we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building brand recognition in the chinese residential and commercial markets in 2007 the company generated sales of 147 million in china an increase of 26 percent compared with 2006 we believe we are the second largest supplier of water heaters to the residential market in china 

we sell our water heating products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design quality of products and services performance and price our principal domestic water heating competitors include rheem manufacturing company inc bradfordwhite corporation and lochinvar corporation our primary competitor in china is haier appliances a chinese company but we also compete with makro rinnai and ariston as well as numerous other chinese private and stateowned water heater and boiler manufacturing companies 

electrical products 

in our electrical products business improved selling price and growth in the global market were more than offset by lower unit volumes sales in the segment declined one percent in 2007 or approximately 12 million to 8940 million compared with 2006 unit volume sales were negatively impacted by the weak housing market most notably in the residential hermetic and pump motor segments which more than offset improved sales in the commercial hermetic and distribution market segments 

we are one of the four largest manufacturers of electric motors in north america we offer a comprehensive line of hermetic motors fractional horsepower ac and dc motors and integral horsepower motors ranging in size from subfractional c – frame ventilation motors up to 1320 horsepower hermetic and 400 horsepower integral motors we believe our extensive product offerings give us an advantage in our targeted markets often allowing us to serve all of our customer’s electric motor needs 

our motors are used in a wide range of targeted residential and commercial applications including hermetic motors that are sold worldwide to manufacturers of air conditioning and commercial refrigeration compressors fractional horsepower fan motors used in furnaces air conditioners and blowers fractional horsepower motors for pumps for home water systems swimming pools hot tubs and spas fractional horsepower motors used in other consumer products such as garage door openers and integral horsepower ac and dc motors for industrial and commercial applications sales to the north american oem heating ventilating air conditioning and refrigeration market account for approximately 33 percent of segment sales approximately 82 percent of our 2007 segment sales were to oems in a diverse mix of industries with the remainder of sales sold through aftermarket or distribution channels we believe that at least 25 percent of our total segment sales were attributable to products used outside of the united states a significant portion of our electrical products business is derived from the replacement of existing product and it is believed that the sale of product to the residential new housing construction market in north america represents approximately 25 percent of the segment’s total sales 

to remain a leader in this highly competitive industry we are committed to being a lowcost supplier of electric motors since 2001 we have undertaken initiatives to accelerate costreduction in our motor operations to enhance our competitive position these initiatives included the closure of seven us facilities as well as our operations in bray ireland and taizhou china transferring related production to our lower cost operations in mexico and china 

at the end of the third quarter of 2007 we announced that we will close our operations in scottsville ky and mebane nc and consolidate our hermetic motor assembly operations in acuna mexico and suzhou china we expect the transfer of work at both hermetic motor facilities to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2008 we will also close our motor manufacturing facility in budapest hungary and transfer the remaining production to china the 2007 expense associated with the closure of budapest was 92 million while we received a tax benefit of 99 million associated with the write down of that investment we expect to complete the closing of budapest by the end of february 2008 for all of 2007 the restructuring expense at electrical products totaled 228 million before taxes or 89 million after taxes equivalent to 29 per share 

  

in 2008 we expect to record an additional pretax restructuring charge of approximately 132 million associated with the abovementioned facilities equivalent to 79 million after taxes or approximately 25 per share the expense is expected to be incurred relatively evenly throughout 2008 

in november 2003 we acquired taicang special motor co ltd taicang of suzhou china a manufacturer of hermetic motors for commercial air conditioning equipment taicang currently serves the chinese operations of a number of north american air conditioning companies and enhances our position in the global hermetic motor market in november of 2005 we completed our fourth motor acquisition in china with the purchase of yueyang zhongmin special electrical machinery co ltd located in hunan province yueyang manufactures large hermetic motors used in commercial air conditioning applications 

we sell our electric motor products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design quality of products and services performance and price our principal competitors in the electric motor industry are emerson electric co regal beloit corporation and baldor electric company 

raw material 

raw materials for our manufacturing operations which consist primarily of steel copper and aluminum are generally available from several sources in adequate quantities we typically hedge a portion of our annual copper and aluminum purchases to protect against price volatility in addition a portion of electrical products customers are contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in certain of our raw material prices recent consolidation in the steel industry and worldwide demand for steel have resulted in significant cost increases for steel 

research and development 

in order to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin as well as at our operating units total expenditures for research and development in 2007 2006 and 2005 were 478 423 and 360 million respectively 

patents and trademarks

employees 

our company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 16800 employees as of december 31 2007 

backlog 

due to the shortcycle nature of our businesses none of our operations sustain significant backlogs 

environmental laws 

our operations are governed by a variety of federal state and local laws intended to protect the environment while environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures compliance with the environmental laws has not had and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of our company see item 3

 item 1a – risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design quality of products and services product performance maintenance costs and price we compete against manufacturers located in the united states and throughout the world we also face potential competition from some oems to whom we sell our electrical products and from our customers and the end users of our products who continually assess any costs that could be reduced by vertically integrating or using alternate sources for the products we manufacture some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing and distribution resources than we have we cannot assure that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 we sell a portion of our products for new residential and commercial construction the strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and business investment which are a function of many factors beyond our control including interest rates employment levels availability of credit and consumer confidence downturns in the markets we serve could result in lower revenues and lower profitability new housing starts declined in 2006 and 2007 and the pace may continue at the lower levels or decline further and commercial construction activity which has been high in recent years could decline as well we believe that approximately 15 percent of our water products and 25 percent of our electrical products businesses respectively are affected by changes in the residential housing construction markets furthermore though we believe that the majority of the commercial business we serve is for replacement we could also be affected by changes in the commercial construction market 

 

 net sales to our four largest customers represented approximately 26 percent of 2007 net sales our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our dependence on sales from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to other sources the loss of one or more of our largest customers any reduction or delay in sales to these customers our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or future price concessions that we may make could significantly harm our business 

  

 a significant portion of our 2007 net sales were attributable to products manufactured outside of the united states principally in mexico and china and expanding international manufacturing capacity in mexico and china is part of our strategy to reduce costs approximately 6600 of our 16800 total employees and 17 of our 40 manufacturing facilities are located in mexico approximately 4400 employees and five manufacturing facilities are located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade restrictions the impact of foreign government regulations and the effects of income and withholding tax governmental expropriation and differences in business practices we may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenue unfavorable changes in the political regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 over 90 of our electric motor manufacturing productive labor hours are incurred in mexico and china the peso based costs we incur manufacturing these products are directly related to changes in labor costs in mexico and fluctuations in exchange rates of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar the labor costs we incur are measured in us dollars and based on the cost of labor in mexican pesos historically mexico has had higher wage inflation than the united states that inflation does not adversely affect our costs when there is a corresponding decrease in the value of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar however during periods in which the value of the mexican peso increases or remains stable relative to the us dollar higher wage inflation in mexico results in an increase in our labor costs manufacturing and material costs we incur in china are principally incurred in chinese rmb if the rmb continues to strengthen against the us dollar our costs would increase 

 

 the market price for certain key materials we purchase eg steel copper aluminum diesel fuel and natural gas have been very volatile in the recent past while our company periodically does enter into futures contracts to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases principally copper and aluminum significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in any customer recovery of increased material costs in addition in some cases we are dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components required in the manufacture of our product 

 

 the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by 397 million at december 31 2007 the pension plans continue to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations and under current assumptions no funding will be required until the pension protection act ppa provisions become effective in 2008 beginning in 2008 the minimum required contribution will equal the target normal cost plus a seven year amortization of any funding shortfall offset by any erisa credit balance among the key assumptions inherent in the actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially 

 

 our total assets include substantial goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at one or more of our businesses does not meet expectations we may be required to reflect 

  

under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill may affect our ability to maintain the required debttocapital ratio existing under our debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 acquisitions we have made since 1997 have had a significant impact on our results of operations during that period while we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future if we complete any future acquisitions then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing we cannot assure you that future acquisitions will not have a material adverse affect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our water heater and electric motor products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 our electric motors business has successfully closed plants and transitioned many products to lower cost regions however every plant closure carries the risk of a failed execution if we fail to transition the product on time or if we fail to meet the customer’s testing requirements at the new facility we could lose some business to our competitors we cannot assure that we will be able to retain all of the business that we are moving and the loss of a customer or a particular product line to a competitor could negatively impact our operating earnings 

 

 we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock are entitled as a class to elect only 25 percent of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors as of december 31 2007 smith investment company effectively controlled 70 percent of our board of directors and our operations because it beneficially owned approximately 98 percent of our class a common stock due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and shares of our class a common stock smith investment company is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and our class a common stock could have the effect of delaying deterring or preventing a change of control as of december 31 2007 smith investment company beneficially owned approximately 32 percent of the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock and class a common stock

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

we achieved record net earnings of 882 million or 285 per share in 2007 compared with 765 million or 247 per share in 2006 and 465 million or 154 per share in 2005 net earnings recorded in 2007 were higher than 2006 due to a full year of the gsw business acquired in april 2006 higher sales of commercial product another strong year for our china water heater business and a lower effective tax rate these improvements were partially offset by higher sga expenses and restructuring charges in 2007 compared with 2006 net earnings recorded in 2006 were higher than in 2005 as a result of the gsw acquisition in the second quarter of 2006 higher margins in both businesses and strong china water heater company performance our individual segment performance will be discussed later in this section 

our working capital was 2950 million at december 31 2007 compared with 3227 million and 2684 million at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively the 277 million reduction in our working capital in 2007 compared with 2006 was a result of lower inventories in our electrical products segment higher accounts payable balances in both businesses were offset by an increase in our water products segment’s accounts receivable balances the 543 million increase in working capital in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to the acquisition of gsw in addition increases in receivables primarily in our water products segment and increases in inventory levels primarily in our electrical products segment were partially offset by an expansion in the accounts payable balances at water products 

cash provided by operating activities during 2007 was 1905 million compared with 1288 million during 2006 and 1867 million during 2005 higher net earnings in 2007 compared with 2006 combined with higher depreciation and amortization and the working capital decrease described above explain the 617 million year over year improvement in our cash flow despite higher earnings in 2006 cash provided by operating activities was lower than in 2005 due to a 211 million expansion in working capital in 2006 compared with the significant contraction in working capital that was achieved in 2005 

our capital expenditures were 714 million in 2007 slightly higher than the 682 million spent in 2006 our capital spending in 2006 was almost 18 million higher than in 2005 due primarily to the capital spending at gsw acquired in april of 2006 and higher spending at electrical products we are projecting 2008 capital expenditures of between 85 and 90 million at least 15 million greater than projected depreciation and amortization expense the projected increase in capital spending in 2008 over 2007 levels is associated with the expansion of our nanjing china water heater and yueyang china motor operations 

in february 2006 we completed a 425 million multicurrency five year revolving credit facility with a group of ten banks the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings and it expires on february 17 2011 as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt at december 31 2007 we had available borrowing capacity of 2076 million under this facility we believe that the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

our total debt was 3952 million at the end of december 2007 compared with 4390 million at the end of 2006 in turn our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 34 percent at the end of 2007 compared with 39 percent at the end of 2006 and 22 percent at the end of 2005 

our purchase of gsw was completed on april 3 2006 for 3393 million us dollar equivalent the purchase was made with a combination of borrowings under our credit facility commercial paper and 30 million canadian term notes as a result of the acquisition our total debt increased 2697 million from 1693 million at december 31 2005 to 4390 million at december 31 2006 

  

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 is as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2007 the liability for uncertain income tax positions was 48 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to the company’s scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments considered firm 

gsw operated a captive insurance company to provide product liability and general liability insurance to its subsidiary american water heater company american we decided to cover american’s liability exposures with our existing insurance programs and operate the captive in runoff effective july 1 2006 the reinsurance company restricts the amount of capital which must be maintained by the captive at december 31 2007 the restricted amount was 389 million compared with 377 million at the end of 2006 and is included in other noncurrent assets the restricted assets are invested in money market securities 

in february 2007 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program in the amount of one million shares of our common stock during 2007 we completed the repurchase of all one million shares at an average cost of 3662 per share our board approved an additional one million shares to be repurchased under this program at its december 14 2007 meeting 

our pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations while we were not required to make a contribution to the plan in 2007 we elected to make a contribution of 160 million similarly no contributions are required to be made in 2008 but we may elect to make a voluntary contribution at some point in 2008 for further information on our pension plan see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have paid dividends for 68 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 16 years we paid total dividends of 70 per share in 2007 compared with 66 per share in 2006 

results of operations 

our sales in 2007 were a record 231 billion an increase of 1508 million or 70 percent from sales of 216 billion in 2006 the sales increase occurred in our water products segment and was due to a full year of the gsw business acquired in april 2006 which added 128 million of sales in the first quarter of 2007 as well as increased sales of commercial water heaters and higher sales in china sales for electrical products declined 119 million from 9059 million in 2006 to 8940 million in 2007 as improved pricing was more than offset by lower volume sales in 2006 increased by 4721 million or 279 percent from sales of 169 billion in 2005 due to our gsw acquisition which contributed 3613 million in sales as well as an increase of 35 million in sales at our china operation and general improvement in our commercial and residential businesses 

  

sales in 2006 for electrical products increased 449 million over 2005 due to improved pricing and our yueyang acquisition made in november 2005 which more than offset a unit volume decline in the underlying motor business 

our gross profit margin for 2007 was 222 percent compared to 215 percent in 2006 the improved margins in 2007 were due mostly to sales of higher margin products in our water products segment our gross profit margin increased from 208 percent in 2005 to 215 percent in 2006 due to the addition of gsw and improved margins in the legacy water heater business 

selling general and administrative expense sga increased 390 million from 3240 million in 2006 to 3630 million in 2007 the majority of the increase in sga in 2007 was due to higher selling and advertising costs to support increased sales at our water heater segment and included 152 million of first quarter sga attributable to the gsw acquisition sga increased 722 million from 2005 to 2006 due to the addition of gsw continued expansion in china and higher pension costs 

pension expense in 2007 was 122 million compared to 119 million in 2006 and 51 million in 2005 the increase in pension expense from 2006 to 2007 was due to curtailment charges and other onetime expenses as partially offset by lower amortization of deferred asset losses the increase in pension expense from 2005 to 2006 was due to recognition of deferred asset losses 

in 2007 a pretax charge of 247 million was recorded for restructuring and other charges of this charge 228 million was recognized in our electrical products segment with 120 million of the charge attributable to the closing of our operations in scottsville ky and mebane nc and the write down of other assets the closing of these plants results in our hermetic motor assembly operations being consolidated in acuna mexico and suzhou china the pretax charge of 92 million associated with the closing of our motor facility in budapest hungary is also included in the restructuring charge we expect to recognize an additional 132 million pretax restructuring charge in 2008 associated with the aforementioned closings transfer of work from scottsville and mebane to mexico is scheduled to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2008 while the remaining production from budapest is expected to be transferred to china by the end of the first quarter of 2008 a pretax charge of 16 million is included in the electrical products charge for certain other domestic repositioning and asset writedown expenses in addition to the restructuring charges at electrical products we also recognized a 19 million pretax corporate charge related to previously owned businesses in 2006 a pretax restructuring and other charge of 96 million was recorded of this charge 89 million was recognized in our electrical products segment most of which was related to the closure of our mcminnville tn motor fabrication plant which was completed in the first quarter of 2007 and the closure of our motor operation in taizhou china in the fourth quarter of 2006 in 2005 our electrical products segment recorded restructuring charges of 124 million of which 70 million was related to the closure of our bray ireland facility and was nondeductible for tax purposes and an additional 54 million charge was related to product repositioning programs at domestic motor plants an additional 42 million of restructuring and other charges was recorded in 2005 as corporate expense and was associated with previously owned businesses 

interest expense in 2007 increased to 267 million from 249 million in 2006 due to gsw acquisition related financing costs incurred for a full year in 2007 versus only nine months in 2006 interest expense increased from 130 million in 2005 to 249 million in 2006 due to incremental debt incurred to finance the acquisition of gsw 

in 2007 net other income was 09 million compared to net other expense of 06 million in 2006 the differential was due to 05 million of interest income on restricted marketable securities for gsw in the first quarter of 2007 with the remainder due primarily to exchange gains associated with us dollar denominated purchases made by our canadian operations net other expense decreased by 13 million from 2005 to 2006 as a result of interest income on the restricted marketable securities acquired in the gsw transaction 

our effective tax rate was 117 percent in 2007 273 percent in 2006 and 323 percent in 2005 the 2007 effective rate includes a 37 million tax benefit upon completion of tax audits and lapse of statutes of limitations and a 11 million china investment incentive tax benefit also included in the 2007 rate is a 99 million tax benefit associated with the write off of the investment in our hungarian subsidiary the geographic composition of our 2007 and 2006 pretax earnings resulted in a significant reduction in our effective tax rate in those years as a greater proportion of earnings was recognized in the lower taxed countries of china and mexico compared to the united states and europe the higher rate in 2005 was impacted by losses incurred in ireland that could not be tax effected 

  

our 2007 net earnings were a record 882 million an increase of 117 million or 153 percent over net earnings of 765 million in 2006 on a per share basis 2007 earnings were 285 compared with 247 

water products 

sales for our water products segment were a record 142 billion in 2007 or 1623 million higher than sales of 126 billion in 2006 the increase was due to a full year of the gsw business acquired in april 2006 which added 1280 million of sales in the first quarter of 2007 a 301 million increase in sales at our china operation and increased sales of commercial water heaters sales in 2006 were 4275 million higher than sales of 8333 million in 2005 the increase was due to our gsw acquisition which contributed 3613 million in sales an increase of almost 35 million in sales at our china operation and general improvement in our commercial and residential businesses 

operating earnings for water products increased 225 percent to 1500 million in 2007 from 1224 million in 2006 the increase in earnings was due to an additional three months of gsw earnings higher earnings in china and sales of higher margin products all of which offset lower residential water heater volume operating earnings of 1224 million in 2006 were 54 percent higher than earnings of 795 million in 2005 the increase was primarily due to the gsw acquisition but was also the result of the 35 million revenue increase in china and improved performance and product mix in the legacy business 

electrical products 

sales in our electrical products segment in 2007 were 8940 million or 13 percent lower than 2006 increased selling prices to offset higher costs for raw materials were more than offset by the impact of lower unit volume primarily caused by the weak housing market lower volume in the residential hermetic and pump motor markets more than offset improved sales in the commercial hermetic and distribution market segments sales in 2006 of 9059 million were 52 percent higher than 2005 sales from our yueyang acquisition made in november 2005 accounted for half of the sales increase while improved pricing as partially offset by a unit volume decline provided the remainder of the increase 

operating earnings at our electrical products segment were 231 million in 2007 compared with 481 million in 2006 the majority of the decline in earnings was due to an increase in restructuring charges from 89 million in 2006 to 228 million in 2007 the remaining decline in earnings was caused by lower unit volumes operating earnings in 2006 were 58 million higher than earnings of 423 million in 2005 due mostly to a reduction in restructuring charges from 124 million in 2005 to 89 million in 2006 please refer to the previous discussion on restructuring charges for additional details 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we constantly reevaluate these significant factors and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an armslength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales 

  

earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct annual thorough and competent valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed on a periodic basis at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience while our warranty costs have historically been within its calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business a substantial portion of these claims involve our water products business while such claims in our electrical products business have historically been limited we maintain insurance to reduce our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by year as of december 31 2007 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million per occurrence 

gsw insurance coverage included selfinsurance retentions that varied by business segment and by year effective april 3 2006 gsw maintained a 250 million aggregate loss retention through selfinsurance and captive insurance company coverage gsw claims occurring on or after july 1 2006 are covered under the company’s insurance program 

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also use an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumptions for the expected rate of return on plan assets is 875 percent in 2007 unchanged from 2006 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs increased from 575 percent in 2006 to 590 percent in 2007 in 2008 the rate of return on plan assets is 875 percent and the discount rate is 65 percent 

in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluate our pension plan’s target asset allocation the historical longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is between 60 to 70 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers due to market fluctuations our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2007 was 71 percent to equity managers 24 percent to bond managers four percent to private equity managers and the remainder in money market instruments we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical 10year and 25year compounded annualized returns are 86 percent and 121 percent respectively we believe that with our target and actual allocation and the historical longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 875 percent expected return on assets for 2008 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2007 and 2006 were based on the hewitt yield curve hyc which was designed by hewitt associates to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the hyc is a hypothetical double a yield curve represented by a series of 

  

annualized individual discount rates each bond issue underlying the hyc is required to have a rating of aa or better by moody’s investor service inc or a rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s prior to using the hyc rates the discount rate assumptions for pension expense in 2005 was based on investment yields available on aa rated longterm corporate bonds the discount rates determined on the basis described above were 65 percent 59 percent and 575 percent at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

we estimate that we will recognize approximately 50 million of pension expense in 2008 compared to 122 million in 2007 lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2008 by approximately 18 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2008 net pension expense by approximately 14 million 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  ” this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return the provisions of fin 48 were adopted by the company on january 1 2007 please see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further disclosure 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability sfas no 157 will be effective for the company beginning in 2008 the company is assessing the potential impact that the adoption of sfas no 157 will have on its consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 r sfas no 158 requires that the company recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet as of december 31 2006 with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur as further discussed in note 11 the company adopted sfas no 158 effective december 31 2006 sfas no 158s provisions regarding the change in the measurement date of postretirement benefit plans are not applicable as the company already uses a measurement date of december 31 for its benefit plans 

outlook 

we are forecasting lower unit sales in our residential businesses in 2008 furthermore we believe the weakness in construction could broaden and negatively affect our commercial businesses later in the year accordingly we are projecting commercial sales to be flat to down in the north american market for the full year on a more positive note we expect our businesses in china to continue to generate favorable results in the coming year in the face of these market challenges as evidenced by the actions we are taking in our motor business our operating units are working diligently to reduce costs and better position operations for market adversity as a result of our cautious outlook for the year we expect a o smith to earn between 270 and 290 per share in 2008 which includes restructuring expense of approximately 25 per share 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2007 and are not expected to be material in any single year we have accrued amounts associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

  

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency and certain commodities we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward and futures contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

commodity risks include raw material price fluctuations we use futures contracts to fix the cost of our expected needs for certain raw materials ie copper and aluminum with the objective of reducing price risk futures contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume levels which approximate expected usage at december 31 2007 we had commodity futures contracts amounting to 665 million of commodity purchases a hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity price of such contracts would have a potential impact of 67 million it is important to note that gains and losses from our futures contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase transactions being hedged 

in addition we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2007 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 1469 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 147 million it is important to note that gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2007 we had 1989 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 51 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 10 million

 item 1  business 

we are a leading manufacturer of water heating equipment and electric motors serving a diverse mix of residential commercial and industrial end markets principally in the united states with a growing international presence our company is comprised of two operating segments water products and electrical products our water products business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of residential gas and electric water heaters standard and specialty commercial water heating equipment highefficiency coppertube boilers and water systems tanks our electrical products business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of hermetic motors fractional horsepower alternating current ac and direct current dc motors and integral horsepower motors in 2006 we had net sales of approximately 22 billion with 58 percent attributable to our water products business and 42 percent attributable to our electrical products business 

the following table summarizes our sales by operating segment this segment summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements which appear elsewhere in this document 

 

 water products 

our water products business had sales in 2006 of 126 billion which were 51 percent or 428 million higher than in 2005 the higher sales were primarily the result of the acquisition of gsw inc gsw a canadian water heating company acquired on april 3 2006 for approximately 340 million in cash gsw the parent of american water heater company american based in johnson city tn and gsw water heating of fergus ontario canada added sales of 361 million in the last nine months of 2006 our chinese operation reflecting growth of 40 in 2006 added 35 million in sales the balance of the sales growth resulted from modestly higher unit volumes and improved pricing 

we serve residential commercial and industrial end markets with a broad range of products including 

residential gas and electric water heaters  our residential water heaters come in sizes ranging from twogallon pointofuse models to 120gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges we offer traditional atmospheric water heaters as well as directvented and powervented models for today’s energy efficient homes north american residential water heater sales in 2006 were approximately 900 million or just over 70 percent of segment revenues 

standard commercial water heaters our gas oil and electric water heaters come in capacities ranging from 6 gallons to 130 gallons and are used by customers who require a consistent economical source of hot water typical applications include restaurants hotels and motels laundries car washes and small businesses 

a significant portion of our water products business is derived from the replacement of existing product and it is believed that the sale of product to the residential new housing construction market represents approximately 15 percent of the segments total sales our water products business also manufactures and markets specialty commercial water heaters coppertube boilers expansion tanks and related products and parts 

we are the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in north america and we have a leading share in both the residential and commercial segments of the market in the commercial segment we believe our comprehensive product line gives us a competitive advantage in this highermargin segment of the water heating industry as the leader in the residential water heating segment we offer an extensive line of highefficiency gas and electric models 

our water products wholesale distribution channel includes more than 1150 independent wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 6300 selling locations serving residential commercial and industrial markets we also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel in this channel our customers include five of the seven largest national hardware and home center chains including longstanding private label relationships with both lowes and sears roebuck and co 

  

we entered the chinese water heater market through a joint venture in 1995 buying out our partner three years later since that time we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building brand recognition in the chinese residential and commercial markets in 2006 the company generated sales of 121 million an increase of 40 compared with 2005 

our principal domestic water heating competitors include rheem manufacturing company inc bradfordwhite corporation and lochinvar corporation the company’s primary competitors in china are haier appliances a chinese company and ariston a subsidiary of indesit company of italy as well as numerous other chinese private and stateowned water heater and boiler manufacturing companies 

electrical products 

sales of 906 million in our electrical products segment were five percent higher than in 2005 the sales improvement was due to improved pricing and the november 2005 acquisition of the yueyang special electrical machinery co ltd yueyang commercial motor business in china which more than offset lower unit volumes 

we are one of the three largest manufacturers of electric motors in north america having manufactured approximately 40 million electric motors in 2006 we offer a comprehensive line of hermetic motors fractional horsepower ac and dc motors and integral horsepower motors ranging in size from subfractional cframe ventilation motors up to 500 horsepower hermetic and 400 horsepower integral motors we believe our extensive product offerings give us an advantage in our targeted markets often allowing us to serve all of our customer’s electric motor needs 

our motors are used in a wide range of targeted residential commercial and industrial applications including hermetic motors that are sold worldwide to manufacturers of air conditioning and commercial refrigeration compressors fractional horsepower fan motors used in furnaces air conditioners and blowers fractional horsepower motors for pumps for home water systems swimming pools hot tubs and spas fractional horsepower motors used in other consumer products such as garage door openers and integral horsepower ac and dc motors for industrial and commercial applications sales to the heating ventilating air conditioning and refrigeration market account for approximately 50 percent of segment sales approximately 85 percent of our 2006 segment sales were to oems in a diverse mix of industries with the remainder of sales directed to the aftermarket or distribution channels we believe that more than 25 percent of our total segment sales were attributable to products used outside of the united states a significant portion of our electrical products business is derived from the replacement of existing product and it is believed that the sale of product to the residential new housing construction market represents less than 30 percent of the segments total sales 

to remain a leader in this highly competitive industry we are committed to being a lowcost supplier of electric motors we were one of the first motor manufacturers to identify the costreduction potential of mexican operations and today we manufacture a majority of our electric motors in our 16 mexican motor facilities earlier in this decade we undertook initiatives to accelerate costreduction in our motor operations to enhance our competitive position these initiatives included the closure of four domestic plants three of which were closed in 2003 and the transfer of production to our lower cost operations in mexico and china in 2005 we closed our facility in bray ireland and closed or downsized several other us based facilities the company took a pretax charge for the closure of the bray facility of 70 million and 54 million for the additional repositioning actions in 2006 we recognized a pretax charge of 89 million primarily related to the closure of our mcminnville tn plant scheduled for completion in early 2007 and the fourth quarter closure of our motor operation in taizhou china we will continue to optimize our operations in mexico and china by transferring production from higher to lower cost operations 

in december 2002 we acquired the jiangsu changheng group co ltd changheng of changzhou and taizhou china while changheng has an existing customer base in china the primary purpose of the changheng acquisition was to further expand our ability to manufacture products for the u s market in november 2003 we acquired taicang special motor co ltd taicang of suzhou china a manufacturer of hermetic motors for commercial air conditioning equipment taicang currently serves the chinese operations of a number of north american air conditioning companies and enhances our position in the global hermetic motor market in november of 2005 we completed our fourth motor acquisition in china with the purchase of yueyang located in hunan province yueyang with more than 20 million in annual sales in china manufactures large hermetic motors used in commercial air conditioning applications 

our principal competitors in the electric motor industry are emerson electric co and regal beloit corporation a number of other companies such as fasco motors a subsidiary of tecumseh products baldor electric and jakel incorporated compete with us in specific segments of the electric motor market

raw materials for our manufacturing operations which consist primarily of steel copper and aluminum are generally available from several sources in adequate quantities we typically hedge a portion of our annual copper and aluminum purchases to protect against price volatility 

seasonality

research and development patents and trademarks 

in order to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin as well as at our operating units total expenditures for research and development in 2006 2005 and 2004 were 423 360 and 359 million respectively 

we own and use in our businesses various trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and licenses while a number of these are important to us we do not consider a material part of our business to be dependent on any one of them 

employees 

our company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 18000 employees as of december 31 2006 

backlog 

due to the shortcycle nature of our businesses none of our operations sustain significant backlogs 

environmental laws 

our operations are governed by a variety of federal state and local laws intended to protect the environment while environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures compliance with the environmental laws has not had a material effect and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of our company see item 3

 item 1a – risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design quality of products and services product performance maintenance costs and price we compete against manufacturers located in the united states and throughout the world we also face potential competition from some oems to whom we sell our electrical products and from our customers and the end users of our products who continually assess any costs that could be reduced by vertically integrating or using alternate sources for the products we manufacture some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing and distribution resources than we have we cannot assure you that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 a portion of our business is cyclical and dependent on consumer spending and to a lesser extent new housing starts and is therefore impacted by the strength of the general economy interest rates and other factors economic factors adversely affecting oem production and consumer spending could adversely impact our business during recessionary periods we have been adversely affected by reduced demand for our products 

 

 net sales to our four largest customers represented approximately 24 percent of 2006 net sales our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our dependence on sales from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to other sources the loss of one or more of our largest customers any reduction or delay in sales to these customers our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or future price concessions that we may make could significantly harm our business 

 

 a significant portion of our 2006 net sales were attributable to products manufactured outside of the united states principally in mexico and china and expanding international manufacturing capacity in mexico and china is part of our strategy to reduce costs approximately 7400 of our 18000 total employees and 17 of our 42 manufacturing facilities are located in mexico approximately 4250 employees and six manufacturing facilities are located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade restrictions the impact of foreign government regulations and the effects of income and withholding tax governmental expropriation and differences in business practices we may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenue unfavorable changes in the political regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

   

over 90 of our electric motor manufacturing productive labor hours are incurred in mexico and china the peso based costs we incur manufacturing these products are directly related to changes in labor costs in mexico and fluctuations in exchange rates of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar the labor costs we incur are measured in us dollars and based on the cost of labor in mexican pesos historically mexico has had higher wage inflation than the united states that inflation does not adversely affect our costs when there is a corresponding decrease in the value of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar however during periods in which the value of the mexican peso increases or remains stable relative to the us dollar higher wage inflation in mexico results in an increase in our labor costs manufacturing and material costs we incur in china are principally incurred in chinese rmb if the rmb were to strengthen against the us dollar our costs would increase 

 

 the market price for certain key materials we purchase eg steel copper aluminum diesel fuel and natural gas have been very volatile in the recent past while our company periodically does enter into futures contacts to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases principally copper and aluminum significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in any customer recovery of increased material costs 

 

 the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by 985 million at december 31 2006 the pension plans continue to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations and under current assumptions no funding will be required until the pension protection act ppa provisions become effective in 2008 beginning in 2008 the minimum required contribution will equal the target normal cost plus a seven year amortization of any funding shortfall among the key assumptions inherent in the actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially 

 

 our total assets include substantial goodwill the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets we acquired we assess whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant if future operating performance at one or more of our businesses does not meet expectations we may be required to reflect under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material a significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill may affect our ability to maintain the required debttocapital ratio existing under our debt arrangements we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies—goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets” included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 acquisitions we have made since 1997 have had a significant impact on our results of operations during that period while we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future if we complete any future acquisitions then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing we cannot assure you that future acquisitions will not have a material adverse affect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 many of our electrical products are incorporated into hvac systems and swimming pool pumps that oems sell to end users the number of installations of new and replacement hvac and pool pump systems or components are higher during the spring and summer seasons due to the increased use of air conditioning and swimming pools during warmer months mild or cooler weather conditions during the spring and summer seasons often result in end users deferring the purchase of new or replacement hvac and pool systems or components as a result prolonged periods of mild or cooler weather conditions in the spring or summer seasons in broad geographical areas could have a negative impact on the demand for our electrical products and therefore could have an adverse affect on our operating performance in addition due to variations in weather conditions from year to year our operating performance in any single year may not be indicative of our performance in any future year 

 

 our residential water heater business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of our products in that business while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the parent company of a significant customer of our electrical products business was acquired in december 2005 in january 2006 the acquiring company announced that it intended to explore strategic alternatives for this significant customer of our electrical products business for accounting purposes the significant customer of our electrical products business is being reported as a discontinued operation by the acquiring company though we are unable to ascertain the risk associated with this action it is possible it could have an adverse material impact on our electrical products business 

 

 we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock the holders of common stock are entitled as a class to elect only 25 percent of our board of directors the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors as of december 31 2006 smith investment company effectively controlled 75 percent of our board of directors and our operations because it beneficially owned approximately 97 percent of our class a common stock due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and shares of our class a common stock smith investment company is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and our class a common stock could have the effect of delaying deterring or preventing a change of control as of december 31 2006 smith investment company beneficially owned approximately 31 percent of the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock and class a common stock

 item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

we achieved record net earnings of 765 million or 247 per share in 2006 compared with 465 million or 154 per share in 2005 and 354 million or 118 per share in 2004 net earnings recorded in 2006 were higher than 2005 due to the gsw acquisition in the second quarter of 2006 another strong year for our china water heater business and improved margins in both our water products and electrical products segments net earnings recorded in 2005 were higher than in 2004 as a result of significantly improved performance at our water products segment our individual segment performance will be discussed later in this section 

our working capital was 3227 million at december 31 2006 compared with 2684 million and 3398 million at december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 respectively the 543 million increase in working capital in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to the acquisition of gsw in addition increases in receivables primarily at our water products segment and increases in inventory levels primarily at our electrical products segment were partially offset by an expansion in our water products segment’s accounts payable balances the 714 million reduction in working capital in 2005 reflects a 463 million increase in accounts payable due to achieving market based terms with suppliers and a reduction of 81 million in inventories 

cash provided by operating activities during 2006 was 1288 million compared with 1867 million during 2005 and 666 million during 2004 despite higher earnings in 2006 cash provided by operating activities was lower than in 2005 due to a 211 million expansion in working capital net of acquisitions in 2006 compared with the significant contraction in working capital net of acquisitions that was achieved in 2005 the increase in 2005 was due to higher earnings in addition to the contraction in working capital net of acquisitions items mentioned above 

our capital expenditures were 682 million in 2006 almost 18 million higher than in 2005 due primarily to capital spending at gsw and our electrical products segment our capital expenditures in 2005 were similar to the 484 million of capital expenditures in 2004 we are projecting 2007 capital expenditures to be 75 to 80 million about 10 million greater than our depreciation and amortization expense estimates for 2007 the projected increase in capital spending in 2007 over 2006 levels is associated with higher spending in our water products segment 

in february 2006 we completed a 425 million multicurrency five year revolving credit facility with a group of ten banks the facility expires on february 17 2011 and it replaced a 265 million credit facility which would have expired on june 10 2009 and was terminated on february 17 2006 the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings as well as drawings under the facility are classified as longterm debt at december 31 2006 we had available borrowing capacity of 1662 million under this facility we believe that the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

our acquisition of the common stock of gsw was completed on april 3 2006 for 3393 million the purchase was made with a combination of borrowing under our credit facility commercial paper and canadian term notes more fully described below as a result of the acquisition our total debt increased 2697 million from 1693 million at december 31 2005 to 4390 million at december 31 2006 our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 39 percent at the end of 2006 and 22 percent at the end of 2005 

on april 3 2006 our canadian subsidiary issued 30 million canadian in term notes with two insurance companies the notes expire in 2018 and carry an average interest rate of 53 percent 

gsw operated a captive insurance company to provide product liability and general liability insurance to its subsidiary american we have decided to cover american’s liability exposures with our existing insurance programs and operate the captive in runoff effective july 1 2006 to reduce exposure to interest rates we sold the captive’s fixed income securities with longer maturities and purchased securities that have shorter maturities the reinsurance company restricts the amount of capital which must be maintained by the captive at december 31 2006 the restricted amount was 377 million and is included in other noncurrent assets 

  

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 is as follows 

 

 we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to the company’s scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments considered firm 

our pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations while we are not required to make a contribution to the plan in 2007 we may elect to make a contribution during the year see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have paid dividends for 67 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 15 years we paid total dividends of 66 per share in 2006 compared with 64 per share in 2005

our sales in 2006 were a record 216 billion an increase of 4721 million or 279 percent from sales of 169 billion in 2005 the majority of the sales increase occurred in our water products segment and was due to our gsw acquisition which contributed 3613 million in sales as well as an increase of almost 35 million in sales at our china operation and general improvement in our commercial and residential businesses sales for electrical products increased 449 million over 2005 due to improved pricing and our yueyang acquisition made in november 2005 which more than offset a unit volume decline in the underlying motor business sales in 2005 increased by 361 million or 22 percent from sales of 165 billion in 2004 and resulted from a 27 million increase at our china water heater operation 

our gross profit margin for 2006 was 215 percent compared to 208 percent in 2005 the increase was due to the addition of gsw and improved margins in the legacy water heater business our gross profit margin increased from 180 percent in 2004 to 208 percent in 2005 due to price increases which restored margins to a more normalized relationship between price and costs for raw materials fuel and freight at our water heater operation 

selling general and administrative expense sga increased 722 million from 2518 million in 2005 but as a percent of sales remained constant at about 15 in both 2006 and 2005 the increase in sga in 2006 was caused by the addition of gsw continued expansion in china and higher pension costs sga increased 160 million from 2004 to 2005 as a result of expansion in china higher pension expense and a favorable reserve adjustment for water heater litigation in 2004 

pension expense in 2006 was 119 million compared to 51 million in 2005 and pension income of 6 million in 2004 the increase in pension expense from 2004 to 2006 was due primarily to recognizing deferred asset losses 

in 2006 a pretax charge of 96 million was recorded for restructuring and other charges of this charge 89 million was recognized in our electrical products segment most of which is related to the closure of our mcminnville tn motor fabrication plant scheduled for completion in early 2007 and the fourth quarter closure of our motor operation in taizhou china in 2005 restructuring and other charges were 166 million of which 124 million was recognized in our electrical products segment 70 million of the charge was related to the closure of our bray ireland facility and was nondeductible for tax purposes and an additional 54 million charge was related to product repositioning programs at domestic motor plants the remaining 42 million of the 2005 charge was recorded as corporate expense and was associated with previously owned businesses of this 

  

amount 12 million was recorded to recognize exposure related to a leased facility in our previously owned automotive business which was sold to tower automotive inc tower in 1997 in connection with that transaction we subleased our corydon indiana facility to tower in 2005 tower filed for bankruptcy and rejected the sublease agreement effective october 1 2005 in order to minimize costs we purchased the corydon facility for 45 million on october 11 2005 the 12 million charge in 2005 plus a 04 million charge in 2006 represents an estimate of our expected net loss upon final disposition of this facility the remaining 30 million of the 2005 charge and a 03 million charge in 2006 are associated with retained liabilities of businesses which were sold in 1997 through 2001 the majority of the amount relates to revised estimates for certain environmental exposure and employee litigation matters 

interest expense in 2006 increased to 249 million from 130 million in 2005 the increase was due to incremental debt incurred to finance the acquisition of gsw interest expense in 2004 was 135 million the decline from 2004 to 2005 resulted from lower debt levels which more than offset higher interest rates 

net other expense decreased by 13 million from 2005 to 2006 as a result of interest income on restricted marketable securities acquired in the gsw transaction 

our effective tax rate was 273 percent in 2006 323 percent in 2005 and 255 percent in 2004 the geographic composition of our 2006 and 2004 pretax earnings resulted in a significant reduction in our effective tax rates in those years as a greater proportion of earnings were recognized in the lower taxed countries of china and mexico compared to the united states and europe the higher rate in 2005 was impacted by losses incurred in ireland that could not be tax effected 

our 2006 net earnings were a record 765 million an increase of 300 million or 645 percent over net earnings of 465 million in 2005 on a per share basis 2006 earnings were 247 compared with 154 in 2005 

water products 

sales for our water products segment were a record 126 billion in 2006 or 4275 million higher than sales of 8333 million in 2005 the increase was due to our gsw acquisition which contributed 3613 million in sales an increase of almost 35 million in sales at our china operation and general improvement in our commercial and residential businesses sales in 2005 were 409 million higher than sales of 7924 million in 2004 higher sales at our china operation accounted for 27 million of the increase while the remainder was attributable to improved pricing that more than offset lower unit sales 

operating earnings for water products increased 54 percent to 1224 million in 2006 from 795 million in 2005 the increase in earnings was primarily due to the gsw acquisition but was also the result of the 35 million revenue increase in china and improved performance and mix in the legacy business operating earnings of 795 million in 2005 were more than double earnings of 368 million in 2004 the higher operating earnings were the result of improved pricing to offset higher raw material costs enhanced manufacturing efficiency higher sales in china and a 40 million favorable adjustment to our product warranty reserve the warranty reserve adjustment was due to a change in customer return policies partially offset by steel cost increases 

electrical products 

sales in our electrical products segment in 2006 were 9059 million or 52 percent higher than 2005 sales from our yueyang acquisition made in november of 2005 accounted for half of the sales increase while improved pricing as partially offset by a unit volume decline provided the remainder of the increase sales in 2005 of 861 million were unchanged from 2004 as improvements in pricing related to raw material cost inflation were offset by a decline in unit demand 

operating earnings at our electrical products segment were 481 million in 2006 compared with 423 million in 2005 the increase in earnings was due mostly to a reduction in restructuring charges from 124 million in 2005 to 89 million in 2006 the majority of the 2006 charge is related to the closure of our mcminnville tn motor fabrication plant which is expected to be completed in early 2007 and the fourth quarter closure of our motor operation in taizhou china the 124 million restructuring charge in 2005 consisted of 70 million associated with the bray ireland plant closing and an additional 54 million to downsize certain domestic facilities operating earnings in 2005 were 92 million less than earnings of 515 million in 2004 primarily due to the impact of the 2005 restructuring charge of 124 million as previously discussed 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

  

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity product liability and pensions various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we constantly reevaluate these significant factors and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in conformity with us gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fairvalue method based on management’s judgments and assumptions the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an armslength basis the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including recorded goodwill we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets become impaired any impairment review is by its nature highly judgmental as estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values however we believe that we conduct annual thorough and competent valuations of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment 

product warranty 

our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale the product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed on a periodic basis at times warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience while our warranty costs have historically been within its calculated estimates it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable the allocation of the warranty liability between current and longterm is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates 

product liability 

due to the nature of our products we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business a substantial portion of these claims involve our water products business while such claims in our electrical products business have historically been limited we maintain insurance to reduce or eliminate our risk most insurance coverage includes selfinsured retentions that vary by business segment and by year as of december 31 2006 we maintained a selfinsured retention of 50 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of 1250 million per occurrence 

gsw insurance coverage included selfinsurance retentions that varied by business segment and by year effective april 3 2006 gsw maintained a 250 million aggregate loss retention through selfinsurance and captive insurance company coverage gsw claims occurring on or after july 1 2006 are covered under the company’s insurance program 

we establish product liability reserves for our selfinsured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation we make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate experts we periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances we also use an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time 

pensions 

we have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumptions for the expected rate of return on plan assets is 875 percent in 2006 unchanged from 2005 the discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs decreased from 60 percent in 2005 to 575 percent in 2006 in 2007 the rate of return on plan assets is 875 percent and the discount rate is 59 percent 

  

in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluate our pension plan’s target asset allocation the historical longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is between 60 to 70 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers due to market fluctuations our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2006 was 70 percent to equity managers 24 percent to bond managers three percent to private equity managers and the remainder in money market instruments we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical 10year and 25year compounded annualized returns are 99 percent and 127 percent respectively we believe that with our target and actual allocation and the historical longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 875 percent expected return on assets for 2007 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2006 and 2005 were based on the hewitt yield curve hyc which was designed by hewitt associates to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the hyc is a hypothetical double a yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates each bond issue underlying the hyc is required to have a rating of aa or better by moody’s investor service inc or a rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s prior to using the hyc rates the discount rate assumptions for pension expense in 2005 and 2004 and the future pension obligations at december 31 2004 were based on investment yields available on aa rated longterm corporate bonds the discount rates determined on the basis described above were 59 percent at december 31 2006 and 575 percent at december 31 2005 we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

we estimate that we will recognize approximately 125 million of pension expense in 2007 lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2007 by approximately 17 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2007 net pension expense by approximately 15 million 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 151 inventory costs the statement requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to amounts of idle freight handling costs and spoilage to be recognized as current period expenses we adopted the standard on january 1 2006 adoption of the statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as our historic policy has been to account for inventory costs in a manner consistent with the provisions of this statement 

on december 16 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment which is a revision of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas no 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 95 statement of cash flows generally the approach in sfas no 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 123 however sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 

as described in notes 1 and 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas 123r sharebased payment effective january 1 2006 using the modifiedprospective transition method adoption of this statement had no impact on our financial position statement of operations or cash flows at the date of adoption 

sfas no 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under prior literature excess tax deductions of 42 million were recognized as a financing cash flow in 2006 this requirement reduced net operating cash flows and increased net financing cash flows in periods after adoption the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions were 45 and 25 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on among other things when employees exercise stock options 

in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 fin 47 to clarify the guidance included in sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations fin 47 requires companies to recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated if amounts cannot be reasonably estimated certain disclosures will be required about the unrecognized asset retirement obligations we adopted fin 47 in 2005 adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  ” this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” it prescribes a recognition 

  

threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we will be required to adopt this interpretation as of january 1 2007 the cumulative affect of adopting fin 48 will be recorded in retained earnings we are evaluating the requirements of fin 48 and expect adoption will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability sfas no 157 will be effective for us beginning in 2008 we are assessing the potential impact that the adoption of sfas no 157 will have on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 r sfas no 158 requires that we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet as of december 31 2006 with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur as further discussed in note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements we adopted sfas no 158 effective december 31 2006 sfas no 158s provisions regarding the change in the measurement date of postretirement benefit plans are not applicable as we already use a measurement date of december 31 for our benefit plans 

outlook 

in 2007 water products will benefit from the yearoveryear addition of first quarter sales and earnings from the gsw acquisition additional synergy savings from the integration of the acquisition and growth in the chinese water heater operation of approximately 25 percent excluding gsw and china a decline in unit sales in the legacy water heater business resulting from a slower new housing market and a potentially softer commercial water heating segment should be offset by improved pricing we are expecting business to be softer in the earlier part of the year and to strengthen as the year progresses 

full year sales at electrical products are also projected to be similar to last year as the slowdown in new housing construction is expected to offset the benefit of improved pricing additionally the hvac market is expected to recover somewhat as inventories are restored to more normal levels 

combining these expectations we expect to attain earnings of between 275 and 295 per share in 2007 we expect to start out slow and strengthen during the year adjusted for a currency expense related to the gsw acquisition in the first quarter of 2006 equivalent to approximately ten cents a share first quarter 2007 earnings are expected to be similar to 2006 as the accretion from gsw is offset by softer residential markets and restructuring charges we will take related to repositioning and severance at electrical products these actions are expected to generate early returns and benefit earnings as the year progresses 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal state and local environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2006 and are not expected to be material in any single year we have accrued amounts associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency and certain commodities we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward and futures contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

commodity risks include raw material price fluctuations we use futures contracts to fix the cost of our expected needs for certain raw materials ie copper and aluminum with the objective of reducing price risk futures contracts are purchased over 

  

time periods and at volume levels which approximate expected usage at december 31 2006 we had commodity futures contracts amounting to 1117 million of commodity purchases a hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity price of such contracts would have a potential impact of 112 million it is important to note that gains and losses from our futures contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase transactions being hedged 

in addition we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2006 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 1023 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 102 million it is important to note that gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2006 we had 2403 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 54 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of less than 13 million

 item 9a – controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the management of a o smith corporation under the direction supervision and involvement of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2006 based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective to ensure that material information relating to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within those entities 

changes in internal controls 

there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect our disclosure controls and procedures nor were there any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls as a result no corrective actions were required or undertaken 

management report on internal control 

the management of a o smith corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting a o smith corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

a o smith corporation management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 the acquisition of gsw occurred in april 2006 and has therefore been excluded from this assessment in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  based on our assessment we believe that as of december 31 2006 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

a o smith corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting this report appears on page 47 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and stockholders 

ao smith corporation 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management report on internal control that a o smith corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria a o smith corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

as indicated in the accompanying management report on internal control managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of gsw inc which was acquired on april 3 2006 the operations of the entities acquired in the gsw inc acquisition are included in the 2006 consolidated financial statements of a o smith corporation and constituted 5208 million and 3318 million of total and net assets respectively as of december 31 2006 and 3613 million and 115 million of net sales and net earnings respectively for the year then ended our audit of internal control over financial reporting of a o smith corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the entities acquired in the gsw inc acquisition 

in our opinion management’s assessment that a o smith corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion a o smith corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the coso criteria  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of a o smith corporation as of december 31 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated statements of earnings comprehensive earnings stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2006 and our report dated february 1 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

the following table summarizes our sales by operating segment this segment summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements which appear elsewhere in this document 

 

 electrical products 

our electrical products segment sales of 861 million were flat compared with sales in 2004 moderately lower sales to the heating and air conditioning market were partially offset by modest sales growth in the company’s distribution pump motors and asian market segments 

we are one of the three largest manufacturers of electric motors in north america having manufactured approximately 40 million electric motors in 2005 we offer a comprehensive line of hermetic motors fractional horsepower ac and dc motors and integral horsepower motors ranging in size from subfractional cframe ventilation motors up to 500 horsepower hermetic and 400 horsepower integral motors we believe our extensive product offering gives us an advantage in our targeted markets often allowing us to serve all of our customers’ electric motor needs 

our motors are used in a wide range of targeted residential commercial and industrial applications including hermetic motors that are sold worldwide to manufacturers of air conditioning and commercial refrigeration compressors fractional horsepower fan motors used in furnaces air conditioners and blowers fractional horsepower motors for pumps for home water systems swimming pools hot tubs and spas fractional horsepower motors used in other consumer products such as garage door openers and integral horsepower ac and dc motors for industrial and commercial applications sales to the heating ventilating air conditioning and refrigeration market account for approximately 56 percent of segment sales approximately 85 percent of our 2005 segment sales were to oems in a diverse mix of industries with the remainder of sales directed to the aftermarket or distribution channels we believe that more than 25 percent of our total segment sales were attributable to products used outside of the united states we estimate that approximately 60 percent of sales are derived from the less cyclical replacement business with the remainder being impacted by general business conditions in the retail and new construction markets 

to remain a leader in this highly competitive industry we are committed to being a lowcost supplier of electric motors we were one of the first motor manufacturers to identify the costreduction potential of mexican operations and today we manufacture a majority of our electric motors in our 16 mexican motor facilities in 2001 we undertook an initiative to accelerate the costreduction programs that were already underway in our motor operations to enhance our competitive position these initiatives included the closure of four domestic plants the transfer of production to our lower cost operations in mexico and china the consolidation of warehouse facilities into three hub operations to improve customer service while reducing cost and a ten percent reduction in the salaried workforce in 2005 we undertook additional restructuring actions by closing our facility in bray ireland and closing or downsizing several other domestic facilities we intend to continue to optimize our operations in mexico and china by transferring production from higher to lower cost operations 

  

in december 2001 we acquired shenzhen speeda industries co ltd shenzhen a manufacturer of subfractional horsepower electric motors in china in december 2002 we acquired the jiangsu changheng group co ltd changheng of changzhou china while changheng has an existing customer base in china the primary purpose of both the shenzhen and changheng acquisitions was to further expand our ability to manufacture products for the u s market in november 2003 we acquired taicang special motor co ltd taicang of suzhou china a manufacturer of hermetic motors for commercial air conditioning equipment taicang currently serves the chinese operations of a number of north american air conditioning companies and enhances our position in the global hermetic motor market in november 2005 we completed our fourth motor acquisition in china with the purchase of the yueyang zhongmin special electrical machinery co ltd yueyang located in hunan province yueyang with approximately 15 million in annual sales in china manufactures large hermetic motors used in commercial air conditioning applications the total cost of the acquisition was 179 million including fixed future payments of 14 million and potential future payments not to exceed 17 million 

our principal competitors in the electric motor industry are emerson electric co and regal beloit corporation a number of other companies such as fasco motors a subsidiary of tecumseh products baldor electric and jakel incorporated compete with us in specific segments of the electric motor market 

water systems 

our water systems business had sales in 2005 of 833 million which were 5 percent or 41 million higher than in 2004 the higher sales were primarily the result of a 27 million or 46 increase in sales in china 

in december 2001 we acquired the privately held water heater manufacturer state industries inc state for aggregate cash consideration of 1176 million this was comprised of a 613 million purchase price and the assumption of 563 million of debt the acquisition of state nearly doubled the sales of our water heating business 

we serve residential commercial and industrial end markets with a broad range of products including 

residential gas and electric water heaters  our residential water heaters come in sizes ranging from twogallon pointofuse models to 120gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges we offer traditional atmospheric water heaters as well as directvented and powervented models for today’s energy efficient homes domestic residential water heater sales in 2005 were approximately 570 million or twothirds of segment revenues 

standard commercial water heaters  our gas oil and electric water heaters come in capacities ranging from 50 to 100 gallons and are used by customers who require a consistent economical source of hot water typical applications include restaurants hotels and motels laundries car washes and small businesses 

approximately 80 percent of the residential and commercial markets consist of the replacement of existing product although new construction is also an important factor for the business our water systems business also manufactures and markets specialty commercial water heaters coppertube boilers expansion tanks and related products and parts 

we are one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of water heaters in north america and we are a leader in the commercial water heating segment we believe that our comprehensive commercial product line gives us a competitive advantage in this highermargin segment of the water heating industry we are also one of the leaders in the residential water heating segment with an extensive line of highefficiency gas and electric models 

government regulations are having a significant impact on the united states water heating industry beginning in july 2003 united states water heater manufacturers were required to comply with new flammable vapor ignition resistant standards for residential gas water heaters these new regulations developed by the manufacturers in cooperation with the united states consumer product safety commission dictate that gas water heaters must be designed to protect against accidental ignition of flammable vapors caused by spilled gasoline or other liquids in addition a united states government requirement to increase the efficiency of residential gas and electric water heaters went into effect on january 20 2004 

our water systems wholesale distribution channel includes more than 750 wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 4500 selling locations serving residential commercial and industrial markets we also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel in this channel our customers include four of the seven largest national hardware and home center chains including a longstanding private label relationship with sears holdings corporation 

we entered the chinese water heater market through a joint venture in 1995 buying out our partner three years later since that time we have been aggressively expanding our presence building brand recognition in the chinese residential and commercial markets in 2005 the company generated sales of 86 million an increase of 46 compared with 2004 

  

our principal domestic water heating competitors include rheem manufacturing company inc american water heater company bradfordwhite corporation and lochinvar corporation the company’s primary competitors in china are haier appliances and ariston a subsidiary of indesit company of italy as well as numerous other chinese private and stateowned water heater and boiler manufacturing companies 

raw material 

raw materials for our manufacturing operations which consist primarily of steel copper and aluminum are generally available from several sources in adequate quantities we hedge the majority of our annual copper and aluminum purchases to protect against price volatility 

seasonality 

there is no significant seasonal pattern to our consolidated quarterly sales and earnings 

research and development patents and trademarks 

in order to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin as well as at our operating units total expenditures for research and development in 2005 2004 and 2003 were 360 359 and 346 million respectively 

we own and use in our businesses various trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and licenses while a number of these are important to us we do not consider a material part of our business to be dependent on any one of them 

employees

backlog 

normally none of our operations sustain significant backlogs 

environmental laws

 item 1a – risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision regarding our common stock if any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs then our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment the risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company 

 

 we sell all of our products in highly competitive markets we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design quality of products and services product performance maintenance costs and price we compete against manufacturers located in the united states and throughout the world we also face potential competition from some oems to whom we sell our electrical products and from our customers and the end users of our products who continually assess any costs that could be reduced by vertically integrating or using other alternate sources for the products we manufacture some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing manufacturing and distribution resources than we have we cannot assure you that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 a portion of our electrical products business is cyclical and dependent on consumer spending and is therefore impacted by the strength of the general economy interest rates and other factors economic factors adversely affecting oem production and consumer spending could adversely impact our business during recessionary periods we have been adversely affected by reduced demand for our products 

 

 net sales to our four largest customers represented approximately 25 percent of 2005 net sales our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future our dependence on sales from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to other sources the loss of one or more of our largest customers any reduction or delay in sales to these customers our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or future price concessions that we may make could significantly harm our business 

 

 a significant portion of our 2005 net sales were attributable to products manufactured outside of the united states principally in mexico and china and expanding international manufacturing capacity in mexico and china is part of our strategy to reduce costs approximately 8200 of our 17650 total employees and 17 of our 43 manufacturing facilities are located in mexico approximately 4550 employees and seven manufacturing facilities are located in china international operations generally are subject to various risks including political religious and economic instability local labor market conditions the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade restrictions the impact of foreign government regulations and the effects of income and withholding tax governmental expropriation and differences in business practices we may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenue unfavorable changes in the political regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 over 80 of our electric motor manufacturing productive labor hours are incurred in mexico and china the peso based costs we incur manufacturing these products are directly related to changes in labor costs in mexico and fluctuations in exchange rates of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar the labor costs we incur are measured in us dollars and based on the cost of labor in mexican pesos historically mexico has had higher wage inflation than the united states has had that inflation does not adversely affect our costs when there is a corresponding decrease in the value of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar however during periods in which the value of the mexican peso increases or remains stable relative to the us dollar higher wage inflation in mexico results in an increase in our labor costs manufacturing and material costs we incur in china are principally incurred in chinese rmb if the rmb were to strengthen against the us dollar our costs would increase we are not able to offset any increases in labor costs in mexico when the cost of such labor in mexican pesos is measured in us dollars and may not be able to offset the fluctuations in the chinese rmb relative to the us dollar 

 

 the market price for certain key raw materials we purchase eg steel copper aluminum and natural gas have been very volatile in the recent past while our company does enter into futures contacts to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases principally copper and aluminum significant increases in the cost of any of the key raw materials we purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers historically there has been a lag in any customer recovery of increased raw material costs 

 

 the accumulated benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by 1103 at december 31 2005 the pension plans continue to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations and under current assumptions no funding is required for several years among the key assumptions inherent in the actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets if interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly our pension plan obligations could increase materially 

 

 acquisitions we have made since 1997 have had a significant impact on our results of operations during that period while we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future if we complete any future acquisitions then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing we cannot assure you that future acquisitions will not have a material adverse affect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 many of our electrical products are incorporated into hvac systems that oems sell to end users the number of installations of new and replacement hvac systems or components is higher during the spring and summer seasons due to the increased use of air conditioning during warmer months mild or cooler weather conditions during the spring and summer seasons often result in end users deferring the purchase of new or replacement hvac systems or components as a result prolonged periods of mild or cooler weather conditions in the spring or summer seasons in broad geographical areas could have a negative impact on the demand for our electrical products and therefore could have an adverse affect on our operating performance in 

  

addition due to variations in weather conditions from year to year our operating performance in any single year may not be indicative of our performance in any future year 

 

 our residential water heater business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of our products in that business while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

 the parent company of a significant customer of our electrical products business was acquired in december 2005 in january 2006 the acquiring company announced that it intends to explore strategic alternatives for this significant customer of our electrical products business for accounting purposes the significant customer of our electrical products business will be reported as a discontinued operation by the acquiring company though we are unable to ascertain the risk associated with this action it is possible it could have an adverse material impact on our electrical products business 

 

 we have two classes of common equity our common stock and our class a common stock currently the holders of common stock are entitled as a class to elect only 25 percent of our board of directors currently the holders of class a common stock are entitled as a class to elect the remaining directors as of december 31 2005 smith investment company effectively controlled 75 percent of our board of directors and our operations because it beneficially owned approximately 95 percent of our class a common stock due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and shares of our class a common stock smith investment company is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock and our class a common stock could have the effect of delaying deterring or preventing a change of control as of december 31 2005 smith investment company beneficially owned approximately 32 percent of the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock and class a common stock

in addition to our manufacturing facilities our world headquarters and corporate technology center are located in milwaukee wisconsin we also have offices in el paso texas lavergne tennessee and singapore 

  




 item 3  legal proceedings 

we are involved in various unresolved legal actions administrative proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business involving product liability property damage insurance coverage patents and environmental matters including the disposal of hazardous waste although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss or recovery we believe these unresolved legal actions will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations a more detailed discussion of these matters appears in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

we recorded net earnings of 465 million or 154 per share in 2005 compared with 354 million or 118 per share recorded in 2004 and 522 million or 176 per share in 2003 the 2005 earnings include an aftertax charge of 129 million or 42 per share for restructuring and other charges related primarily to repositioning activities in our electric motor business net earnings recorded in 2005 were higher due to significantly improved performance at our water products company including improved pricing logistics management and efficiency in operations which offset continued high material and energy costs net earnings in 2004 were lower than 2003 as a result of cost increases for steel and freight as well as manufacturing inefficiencies in our ashland city plant and higher selling general and administrative expense sga our individual segment performance will be discussed later in this section 

our working capital excluding shortterm debt was 2684 million at december 31 2005 compared with 3398 million and 3059 million at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 respectively the 714 million decrease in 2005 reflects a 463 million increase in the accounts payable balance due to our concerted effort to achieve terms with our suppliers more in line with our industry and a reduction of 81 million in inventories the 339 million increase in 2004 reflects 449 million higher receivable balances due to longer payment terms experienced by both of our businesses as well as higher sales levels in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year offsetting the increase in receivable balances were 135 million lower inventory levels split about equally between water systems and electrical products and 143 million higher accounts payable balances as mentioned in our 2004 annual report reducing working capital was one of our major initiatives in 2005 

cash provided by operating activities during 2005 was 1867 million compared to 666 million during 2004 and 289 million during 2003 the increase in 2005 was due to higher earnings and a large reduction in net working capital items as described above despite lower earnings in 2004 compared to 2003 a smaller investment in working capital expenditures explains the majority of the improvement in cash flow for 2004 compared with 2003 

our capital expenditures were 506 million in 2005 which was approximately 20 million higher than 2004 and 2003 the increase in 2005 was associated with the expansion of our nanjing water heater operation we are projecting 2006 capital expenditures to be approximately 50  55 million in line with our projected 2006 depreciation expense we believe that our present facilities and planned capital expenditures are sufficient to provide adequate capacity for our operations in 2006 

in june 2004 we completed a 265 million fiveyear revolving credit facility with a group of eight banks this facility expires on june 10 2009 and it replaced a 250 million credit facility which expired on august 2 2004 and was terminated on june 10 2004 the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings are classified as longterm debt at december 31 2005 we had available borrowing capacity of 2580 million under this facility we believe that the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 22 percent at the end of 2005 and 32 percent at the end of 2004 the decrease in the debt to capital ratio was largely due to the improved operating cash flow as discussed above 

  

aggregate contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 is as follows 

 

 we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become committed until six weeks prior to the company’s scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments considered firm 

our pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations we made a voluntary 30 million contribution to our pension plan on june 30 2005 see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

during 2005 our company received full payment in the amount of 341 million for the dip tube class action lawsuit receivable all litigation associated with this issue has been concluded 

we have paid dividends for 66 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 14 years we paid total dividends of 64 per share in 2005 compared with 62 per share in 2004 

results of operations 

our sales in 2005 were 169 billion an increase of 361 million or 22 percent from sales of 165 billion in 2004 the sales increase resulted from a 27 million or 46 percent increase in sales at our china water heater operation sales in 2004 increased by 1224 million or eight percent from sales of 153 billion in 2003 the sales increase was due to new higher priced water heater products as a result of regulatory changes price increases associated with higher steel and freight costs and a 37 percent increase in china water heater sales 

our gross profit margin for 2005 was 208 percent compared with 180 percent and 195 percent in 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in margin from 2004 to 2005 was attributable to price increases which restored margins to a more normalized relationship between price and costs for raw materials fuel and freight at our water heater operation the decline in margin from 2003 to 2004 was caused by higher costs at water systems for raw materials and freight as well as manufacturing inefficiencies 

selling general and administrative expense sga increased 160 million from 2358 million in 2004 sga was 149 percent of sales in 2005 and 143 percent in 2004 the increase in sga in 2005 was caused by expansion in china higher pension costs and a favorable reserve adjustment for state duron water heater litigation in 2004 sga increased 296 million from 2003 to 2004 as a result of higher selling and advertising expenses for water systems expansion in china and higher administrative expenses related to pension and personnel costs 

we have significant pension benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on plan assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets was 875 percent in 2005 and 900 percent in 2004 our 2006 assumption for return on assets is 875 percent we recognized pension expense of 51 million in 2005 and income of 60 million and 116 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively and pension expenses are reflected in cost of products sold and sga see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements we estimate that we will recognize approximately 115 million of pension expense in 2006 

  

in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluate our pension plan’s target asset allocation the historical longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is between 60 to 70 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers due to market fluctuations our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2005 was 70 percent to equity managers 24 percent to bond managers four percent to private equity managers and the remainder in money market instruments we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical 10year and 25year compounded annualized returns are 103 percent and 124 percent respectively we believe that with our target and actual allocation and the historical longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 875 percent expected return on assets for 2006 is reasonable 

the discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at december 31 2005 were based on the hewitt yield curve hyc which was designed by hewitt associates to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans the hyc is a hypothetical double a yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates each bond issue underlying the hyc is required to have a rating of aa or better by moody’s investor service inc or a rating aa or better by standard  poor’s prior to using the hyc rates the discount rate assumptions for pension expense in 2005 2004 and 2003 and the future pension obligations at december 31 2004 were based on investment yields available on aa rated longterm corporate bonds the discount rates determined on the basis described above were 575 percent at december 31 2005 and 600 percent at december 31 2004 we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2006 by approximately 18 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2006 net pension expense by approximately 15 million 

in 2005 a pretax charge of 166 million was recorded for restructuring and other charges of this charge 124 million was recognized in our electrical products segment the closure of our bray ireland motor facility in the second quarter accounted for 70 million of the charge this charge was nondeductible for tax purposes an additional 54 million charge was related to product repositioning programs at domestic motor plants these two initiatives were substantially completed by the end of 2005 and are expected to generate approximately 80 million in annual savings in 2006 

the remaining 42 million of the 166 million charge was recorded as corporate expense and is associated with previously owned businesses of this amount 12 million was taken to recognize exposure related to a leased facility in our previously owned automotive business which was sold to tower automotive inc tower in 1997 in connection with that transaction we subleased our corydon indiana facility to tower in 2005 tower filed for bankruptcy and rejected the sublease agreement effective october 1 2005 in order to minimize costs we purchased the corydon facility for 45 million on october 11 2005 the 12 million charge represents an estimate of our expected net loss upon final disposition of this facility the remaining 30 million of the charge is associated with retained liabilities of businesses which were sold in 1997 through 2001 the majority of this amount relates to revised estimates for certain environmental liability exposure and employee benefit litigation matters 

interest expense in 2005 declined by 05 million to 130 million as a result of lower debt levels which more than offset higher interest rates interest expense was 135 million in 2004 compared with 122 million in 2003 the 13 million increase in 2004 was the result of modestly higher debt levels and interest rates compared with 2003 

our effective tax rate was 323 percent in 2005 255 percent in 2004 and 339 percent in 2003 the geographic composition of our 2004 pretax earnings resulted in a significant reduction of our effective 2004 tax rate as a greater proportion of earnings were recognized in the lower taxed countries of china and mexico compared to the united states and europe 

our 2005 net earnings were 465 million an increase of 111 million or 314 percent over net earnings of 354 million in 2004 on a per share basis 2005 earnings were 154 compared with 118 in 2004 included in the 2005 net earnings was an after tax charge of 129 million or 042 per share for the restructuring and other expenses previously discussed 

electrical products 

sales in our electrical products segment in 2005 were 861 million unchanged from 2004 as improvements in pricing related to raw material cost inflation were offset by a decline in unit demand higher sales in our pump motor distribution and asian operations were offset by sales weakness in heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac and general industries as well as lost sales associated with the closure of our bray ireland facility sales in 2004 were 361 million higher than sales of 8246 million in 2003 due to higher unit volumes and price increases related to higher costs for steel and freight compared with 2003 lower 2004 sales to the hvac market were more than offset by higher sales in the company’s other business segments 

  

operating earnings at our electrical products segment were 423 million in 2005 compared with 515 million in 2004 as previously mentioned the 2005 earnings included a pretax restructuring charge of 124 million consisting of 70 million associated with the bray ireland plant closing and an additional 54 million to downsize certain domestic facilities we anticipate these restructuring activities to generate 8 million of pretax savings in 2006 operating earnings in 2004 were 27 million less than earnings of 542 million in 2003 higher costs for steel and freight and certain administrative expenses more than offset the benefits of steelrelated price increases and cost improvement programs 

in november 2005 the company completed its fourth acquisition in china with the purchase of yueyang zhongmin special electrical machinery co ltd yueyang a manufacturer of hermetic motors located in yueyang city hunan province china the total cost of the acquisition was 179 million including fixed future payments of 14 million and potential future payments not to exceed 17 million yueyang has approximately 15 million in annual sales and is expected to contribute between 03 and 05 per share to our 2006 earnings 

water systems 

sales for our water products segment were a record 8333 million in 2005 or 409 million higher than sales of 7924 million in 2004 sales at our china operation increased by 27 million to 86 million in 2005 representing an increase of 46 the remainder of the sales increase was attributable to improved pricing that more than offset lower unit sales compared with 2004 sales of 7924 million in 2004 increased by 863 million over sales of 7061 million in 2003 the sales growth was driven by the introduction of higher efficiency residential water heaters higher prices related to higher steel and freight costs strong commercial volume a 37 percent increase in our china operations and a full year’s sales of flammable vapor ignition resistant products 

operating earnings of 795 million in 2005 were more than double earnings of 368 million in 2004 the higher operating earnings were the result of improved pricing to offset higher raw material costs enhanced manufacturing efficiency higher sales in china and a 40 million favorable adjustment to our warranty reserve the warranty reserve adjustment was due to a change in customer return policies partially offset by steel cost increases as a result of the improved relationship between pricing and raw material costs gross profit returned to historical levels and operating margin increased to 95 percent compared with 46 percent in 2004 

operating earnings of 368 million in 2004 were 204 million lower than 2003 in spite of benefits related to new product introductions and stronger commercial business associated improvements in operating earnings were more than offset by raw material cost increases higher freight expenses manufacturing inefficiencies and higher selling expense 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the recoverability of certain assets including goodwill as well as those estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity litigation product liability environmental matters and pensions and other postretirement benefits various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we constantly reevaluate these significant factors and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

recent accounting pronouncements 

the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” and sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” we adopted sfas no 143 on january 1 2003 adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements sfas no 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 fin 47 to clarify the guidance included in sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” fin 47 requires companies to recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably 

  

estimated if amounts cannot be reasonably estimated certain disclosures will be required about the unrecognized asset retirement obligations we adopted fin 47 in 2005 adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position 

on december 16 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” which is a revision of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas no 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” generally the approach in sfas no 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 123 however sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 

sfas no 123r must be adopted no later than january 1 2006 early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued we have adopted sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 

as permitted by sfas no 123 we currently account for sharebased payments to employees using apb opinion no 25’s intrinsic value method and as such generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options accordingly the adoption of sfas no 123r’s fair value method could have a significant impact on our results of operations although it will have no impact on our overall financial position the impact of adoption of sfas no 123r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of sharebased payments granted in the future however had we adopted sfas no 123r in prior periods the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements sfas no 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on among other things when employees exercise stock options the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were 45 25 and 08 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb no 20 and sfas no3” the pronouncement requires that all voluntary changes in accounting principle be reported by retrospectively applying the principle to all prior periods that are presented in the financial statements the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 our financial position results of operations or cash flows will only be impacted by sfas no 154 if we implement changes in accounting principles that are addressed by the standard or correct accounting errors in future periods 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs” the statement requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to amounts of idle freight handling costs and spoilage to be recognized as current period expenses the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 with early adoption permitted our policy has been to handle inventory costs in a manner consistent with the provisions of this statement 

outlook 

on february 8 2006 we issued a forecast for 2006 earnings of between 230 and 250 per share the 2006 forecast includes expected nine month earnings accretion of 35 per share for the company’s pending acquisition of gsw inc “gsw” after taking into account the effect of purchase accounting transaction costs and expected synergies available to both the company’s existing water systems unit and gsw 

our electrical products business expects to report higher sales and profits in 2006 as a result of securing contracts for new business the acquisition of the yueyang zhongmin commercial hermetic motors business in china and pretax benefits from last year’s restructuring initiatives of approximately 8 million the company is projecting sales of approximately 60 million from new business included in this projection are the sales from the fourth quarter acquisition of yueyang zhongmin which is expected to add sales of between 15 and 20 million and generate incremental earnings of as much as 05 per share these gains will be partially offset by higher costs for copper as well as higher peso costs increased freight expense and higher employee costs particularly health care and pension expense additionally because of the record breaking performance in the air conditioning market in 2005 we believe that the hvac marketplace could prove difficult in the second half of the year especially if extended cool spring weather tempers the normal air conditioning buying season 

our water systems business is also projecting higher sales and income in 2006 sales are expected to increase modestly as a result of improved residential wholesale water heater market penetration and growth in the market for commercial water heaters additionally its china business is expected to grow at least 20 in 2006 to more than 100 million from 86 million in 2005 in spite of concerns about potential cost volatility for raw materials and freight and related pricing offsets we believe 

  

our water systems business could generate an operating margin of approximately 10 of sales in 2006 before inclusion of the gsw operating results 

on february 3 2006 we entered into a preacquisition agreement with gsw inc a canadian corporation of oakville ontario canada “gsw” under the agreement we will make a cash offer the “offer” to acquire all of the outstanding class a and class b common stock of gsw at a price of 115 canadian per share or approximately 3935 million canadian in the aggregate we simultaneously entered into a deposit agreement with the two majority shareholders of gsw the “majority shareholders” which own approximately 74 percent of the outstanding shares of gsw representing approximately 68 percent of the votes attached to the outstanding shares of gsw under this agreement the majority shareholders irrevocably agreed to accept and deposit their shares to the offer on february 23 2006 we utilizing our subsidiary a o smith enterprises ltd as the offeror began a takeover bid under canadian law to acquire all of the issued and outstanding class a and class b shares of gsw the tender offer will remain open for a minimum of 35 days after which subject to certain conditions a o smith enterprises ltd will be obligated to take up and pay for the shares tendered upon payment for the shares we will take control of gsw thereafter we will take action to acquire the remainder of the outstanding stock of gsw we and our subsidiary have secured financing for the acquisition through a group of ten banks 

with respect to gsw we anticipate a fairly straightforward integration that will optimize operational and logistical efficiencies and that is expected to be completed by the end of next year we are projecting that the inclusion of nine months of gsw’s earnings for 2006 will add approximately 11 million us of after tax income or 35 per share to our earnings for 2006 after taking into account the effect of purchase accounting transaction costs and expected synergies available to both our existing water systems unit and gsw 

other matters 

environmental 

our operations are governed by a number of federal state and local environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2005 and are not expected to be material in any single year although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

market risk 

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency and certain commodities we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward and futures contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

commodity risks include raw material price fluctuations we use futures contracts to fix the cost of our expected needs for certain raw materials ie copper and aluminum with the objective of reducing price risk futures contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume levels which approximate expected usage at december 31 2005 we had commodity futures contracts amounting to 1213 million of commodity purchases a hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity price of such contracts would have a potential impact of 121 million it is important to note that gains and losses from the company’s futures contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase transactions being hedged 

in addition we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2005 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 725 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 73 million it is important to note that gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2005 we had 136 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 35 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of less than 01 million 

  

forwardlooking statements 

this report contains statements that we believe are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as “may” “will” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “believe” “continue” or words of similar meaning these forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this release factors that could cause such a variance include the following significant increases in raw material prices competitive pressures on the company’s businesses instability in the company’s electric motor and water products markets adverse changes in general economic conditions and the potential that assumptions on which the company based its expectations are inaccurate or will prove to be incorrect 

we have made forwardlooking statements in this filing pertaining to the planned acquisition of gsw that are also subject to risks and uncertainties such statements are based on ao smith projections that reflect historical information concerning gsw inc a o smith’s projections concerning future results of gsw inc and certain assumptions by a o smith such statements include the expected timing of the acquisition and assumptions regarding the impact of purchase accounting and the ultimate attainment of projected synergies 

forwardlooking statements included in this form 10k are made only as of the date of this filing and the company is under no obligation to update these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances all subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributed to the company or persons acting on its behalf are qualified entirely by these cautionary statements

 item 9a – controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the management of a o smith corporation under the direction supervision and involvement of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2005 based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective to ensure that material information relating to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within those entities 

changes in internal controls 

there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect our disclosure controls and procedures nor were there any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls as a result no corrective actions were required or undertaken 

management report on internal control 

the management of a o smith corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting a o smith corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

a o smith corporation management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  based on our assessment we believe that as of december 31 2005 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

a o smith corporation’s independent auditors have issued an audit report on our assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting this report appears on page 44 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and stockholders 

ao smith corporation 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management report on internal control that a o smith corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria a o smith corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that a o smith corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion a o smith corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the coso criteria  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of a o smith corporation as of december 31 2005 and 2004 and the related consolidated statements of earnings comprehensive earnings stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2005 and our report dated february 2 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

part iv 




 item 1  business 

  

we are a leading manufacturer of electric motors and water heating equipment serving a diverse mix of residential commercial and industrial end markets principally in the united states with a growing international presence our company is organized in two operating segments electrical products and water systems our electrical products business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of hermetic motors fractional horsepower alternating current ac and direct current dc motors and integral horsepower motors our water systems business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of residential gas and electric water heaters standard and specialty commercial water heating equipment highefficiency coppertube boilers and water systems tanks in 2004 we had net sales of approximately 17 billion with 52 percent attributable to our electrical products business and 48 percent attributable to our water systems business 

  

the following table summarizes our sales by operating segment this segment summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements which appear elsewhere in this document 

  

   

electrical products 

  

our electrical products segment sales increased 36 million or four percent in 2004 to 861 million sales to the heating and air conditioning market declined four percent as a result of the loss of an important contract by one of our major oem customers sales to all of our other market segments were more than ten percent higher than in 2003 reflecting higher unit volumes and price increases related to higher costs for steel and freight 

  

we are one of the three largest manufacturers of electric motors in north america having manufactured approximately 40 million electric motors in 2004 we offer a comprehensive line of hermetic motors fractional horsepower ac and dc motors and integral horsepower motors ranging in size from subfractional cframe ventilation motors up to 500 horsepower hermetic and 400 horsepower integral motors we believe our extensive product offering gives us an advantage in our targeted markets often allowing us to serve all of our customer’s electric motor needs 

  

our motors are used in a wide range of targeted residential commercial and industrial applications including hermetic motors that are sold worldwide to manufacturers of air conditioning and commercial refrigeration compressors fractional horsepower fan motors used in furnaces air conditioners and blowers fractional horsepower motors for pumps for home water systems swimming pools hot tubs and spas fractional horsepower motors used in other consumer products such as garage door openers and integral horsepower ac and dc motors for industrial and commercial applications sales to the heating ventilating air conditioning and refrigeration market account for approximately 56 percent of segment sales approximately 85 percent of our 2004 segment sales were to oems in a diverse mix of industries with the remainder of sales directed to the aftermarket or distribution channels we believe that more than 25 percent of our total segment sales were attributable to products used outside of the united states we estimate that approximately 60 percent of sales are derived from the less cyclical replacement business with the remainder being impacted by general business conditions in the retail and new construction markets 

  

to remain a leader in this highly competitive industry we are committed to being a lowcost supplier of electric motors we were one of the first motor manufacturers to identify the costreduction potential of mexican operations and today we manufacture a majority of our electric motors in our 16 mexican motor facilities in 2001 we undertook an initiative to accelerate the costreduction programs that were already underway in our motor operations to enhance our competitive position these initiatives included the closure of four domestic plants three of which were closed in 2003 the transfer of production to our lower cost operations in mexico and china and the consolidation of warehouse facilities into three hub operations to improve customer service while reducing cost and a ten percent reduction in the salaried workforce though the primary repositioning program has now been largely completed we intend to continue to optimize our operations in mexico and china by transferring production from higher to lower cost operations 

  

in december 2001 we acquired shenzhen speeda industries co ltd shenzhen a manufacturer of subfractional horsepower electric motors in china in december 2002 we acquired the jiangsu changheng group co ltd changheng of changzhou china while changheng has an existing customer base in china the primary purpose of both the shenzhen and changheng acquisitions is to further expand our ability to manufacture products for the u s market in november 2003 we acquired taicang special motor co ltd taicang of suzhou china a manufacturer of hermetic motors for commercial air conditioning equipment taicang currently serves the chinese operations of a number of north american air conditioning companies and enhances our position in the global hermetic motor market 

  

our principal competitors in the electric motor industry are emerson electric co and regal beloit corporation a number of other companies such as fasco motors a subsidiary of tecumseh products baldor electric and jakel incorporated compete with us in specific segments of the electric motor market 

  

water systems 

  

our water systems business had sales in 2004 of 792 million which were 12 percent or 86 million higher than in 2003 the higher sales were the result of the introduction of higher efficiency residential water heaters higher prices related to increased steel and freight costs strong commercial volume a 37 percent increase in china sales and additional flammable vapor ignition resistant product 

  

in december 2001 we acquired the privately held water heater manufacturer state industries inc state for aggregate cash consideration of 1176 million this was comprised of a 613 million purchase price and the assumption of 563 million of debt the acquisition of state nearly doubled the sales of our water heating business 

  

we serve residential commercial and industrial end markets with a broad range of products including 

  

residential gas and electric water heaters  our residential water heaters come in sizes ranging from twogallon pointofuse models to 120gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges we offer traditional atmospheric water heaters as well as directvented and powervented models for today’s energy efficient homes domestic residential water heater sales in 2004 were approximately 530 million or twothirds of segment revenues 

  

standard commercial water heaters  our gas oil and electric water heaters come in capacities ranging from 50 to 100 gallons and are used by customers who require a consistent economical source of hot water typical applications include restaurants hotels and motels laundries car washes and small businesses 

  

approximately 80 percent of the residential and commercial markets consist of the replacement of existing product although new construction is also an important factor for the business our water systems business also manufactures and markets specialty commercial water heaters coppertube boilers expansion tanks and related products and parts 

  

we are one of the two largest manufacturers and marketers of water heaters in north america manufacturing approximately 28 million units in 2004 we have a leading share in the commercial water heating segment and we believe we are the only domestic manufacturer that offers standard and specialty commercial water heater products we believe that our comprehensive commercial product line gives us a competitive advantage in this highermargin segment of the water heating industry we also are one of the leaders in the residential water heating segment with an extensive line of highefficiency gas and electric models 

  

government regulations are having a significant impact on the united states water heating industry beginning in july 2003 united states water heater manufacturers were required to comply with new flammable vapor ignition resistant standards for residential gas water heaters these new regulations developed by the manufacturers in cooperation with the united states consumer product safety commission dictate that gas water heaters must be designed to protect against accidental ignition of flammable vapors caused by spilled gasoline or other liquids in addition a united states government requirement to increase the efficiency of residential gas and electric water heaters went into effect on january 20 2004 

  

our water systems wholesale distribution channel includes more than 750 wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 4500 selling locations serving residential commercial and industrial markets we also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel in this channel our customers include four of the six largest national hardware and home center chains including a longstanding private label relationship with sears roebuck and co 

  

our principal domestic water heating competitors include rheem manufacturing company inc and to a lesser extent american water heater company bradfordwhite corporation and lochinvar corporation we also compete against numerous competitors in international markets 

  

raw material 

  

raw materials for our manufacturing operations which consist primarily of steel copper and aluminum are generally available from several sources in adequate quantities we hedge the majority of our annual copper and aluminum purchases to protect against price volatility while steel prices have increased significantly over the past year we had adequate supply and believe we have agreements in place to assure adequate supply in the future 

  

seasonality 

  

there is no significant seasonal pattern to our consolidated quarterly sales and earnings 

  

research and development patents and trademarks 

  

in order to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin as well as at our operating units total expenditures for research and development in 2004 2003 and 2002 were 359 346 and 304 million respectively 

  

we own and use in our businesses various trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and licenses while a number of these are important to us we do not consider a material part of our business to be dependent on any one of them 

  

employees 

  

our company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 16600 employees as of december 31 2004 

  

backlog 

  

normally none of our operations sustain significant backlogs 

  

environmental laws 

  

our operations are governed by a variety of federal state and local laws intended to protect the environment while environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures compliance with the environmental laws has not had a material effect and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of our company see item 3 

  

foreign sales 

  

total us export sales from our operations were 106 98 and 90 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively

 item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we recorded net earnings of 354 million or 118 per share in 2004 compared with 522 million or 176 per share recorded in 2003 and 513 million or 186 per share in 2002 net earnings recorded in 2004 were negatively impacted by cost increases to steel and freight as well as manufacturing inefficiencies during the first nine months of the year in our ashland city plant and higher selling general and administrative expense sga while net earnings were flat in 2003 compared with 2002 the lower earnings per share amount in 2003 as compared with 2002 reflected the fullyear impact of our stock offering in may 2002 our individual segment performance will be discussed later in this section 

  

our working capital excluding shortterm debt was 3398 million at december 31 2004 compared with 3059 million and 2251 million at december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 respectively the 339 million increase in 2004 reflects 449 million higher receivable balances due to longer payment terms experienced by both of our businesses as well as higher sales levels in the fourth quarter offsetting the increase in receivable balances were 135 million lower inventory levels split about equally between water systems and electrical products and 143 million higher accounts payable balances the 808 million increase in 2003 reflects 466 million higher inventory balances due primarily to extensive manufacturing repositioning in our electric motor business and several new product introductions and manufacturing consolidation in our water systems business additionally receivable balances were 212 million higher due to price increases associated with new product introductions in our water systems business and an increase in international sales which tend to have longer payment terms finally a 131 million increase in accounts payable balances was largely offset by 94 million in restructuring expenses paid out in 2003 reducing working capital is one of our major initiatives in 2005 

  

cash provided by operating activities during 2004 was 672 million compared with 290 million during 2003 and 1160 million during 2002 despite lower earnings in 2004 a smaller investment in working capital explains the majority of the improvement in cash flow compared with 2003 the higher investment in working capital in 2003 as discussed above explains the majority of the difference between 2003 and 2002 

  

our capital expenditures were 485 million in 2004 essentially the same as in 2003 and approximately 22 million higher than in 2002 the increase in 2003 was associated with new product launches in our water systems business we are projecting 2005 capital expenditures to be approximately 55 million essentially the same as our projected 2005 depreciation expense we believe that our present facilities and planned capital expenditures are sufficient to provide adequate capacity for our operations in 2005 

  

in june 2004 we completed a 265 million fiveyear revolving credit facility with a group of eight banks the new facility expires on june 10 2009 and it replaced a 250 million credit facility which expired on august 2 2004 and was terminated on june 10 2004 the new facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings as a result of the longterm nature of this facility the commercial paper and credit line borrowings are now classified as longterm debt at december 31 2004 we had available borrowing capacity of 1539 million under this facility we believe that the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

  

to take advantage of historically low longterm borrowing rates we issued 500 million in senior notes with two insurance companies in june 2003 the notes range in maturity between 2013 and 2016 and carry a weighted average interest rate of slightly less than 45 percent the proceeds of the notes were used to repay commercial paper and borrowing under the credit facility our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 32 percent at the end of 2004 and the end of 2003 

  

aggregate contractual obligations 

  

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 is as follows 

  

   

we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become “firm” until six weeks prior to the company’s scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments considered firm 

  

our pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations and under current actuarial assumptions we do not expect any significant minimum funding requirements for several years see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

included in other assets is a 340 million receivable due to the payments of claims associated with the dip tube class action lawsuit see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements the receivable is classified as a longterm asset because while a trial was completed in 2004 the verdict was inconclusive and a retrial date is expected to be scheduled sometime in 2005 we expect to collect the receivable after 2005 through the satisfaction of a judgment favorable to us alternatively collection could occur in 2005 if a settlement of the lawsuit is reached with the defendants perfection corporation american meter company and insurance companies 

  

we have paid dividends for 65 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 13 years we paid total dividends of 62 per share in 2004 compared with 58 per share in 2003 

  

results of operations 

  

our sales in 2004 were 165 billion an increase of 1224 million or eight percent from sales of 153 billion in 2003 the sales increase resulted from new higherpriced water heater products price increases associated with higher steel and freight costs and a 37 percent increase in china water heater sales 2003 sales increased by 616 million or 42 percent from sales of 147 billion in 2002 the sales increase was due to a fullyear impact of our 2002 acquisitions in the motor business a 44 percent increase in sales at our chinese water heater operation and higher water heater pricing related to steel costs and the introduction of flammable vapor ignition resistant water heaters 

  

our gross profit margin for 2004 was 180 percent compared with 195 percent and 204 percent in 2003 and 2002 respectively the decline in margin from 2003 to 2004 was attributable to higher costs at water systems for raw materials freight and manufacturing inefficiencies the decline in margin from 2002 to 2003 resulted from approximately 40 million of sales from acquired businesses with margins lower than those of our established business 

  

selling general and administrative expense sga increased 296 million from 2062 million in 2003 sga was 143 percent of sales in 2004 and 135 percent in 2003 the increase in sga in 2004 was caused by higher selling and advertising expenses for water systems expansion in china and higher administrative expense related to pension and personnel costs sga in 2003 of 2062 million was consistent with 2002 

  

we have significant pension benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on plan assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets was 90 percent in 2004 unchanged from 2003 our 2005 assumption for return on assets is 875 percent we recognized pension income of 60 million 116 million and 171 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively reflected as reductions to cost of products sold and sga see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements we estimate that we will recognize approximately 35 million of pension expense in 2005 

  

in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluate our pension plan’s target asset allocation the historical longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is between 60 to 70 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers due to market fluctuations our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2004 was 71 percent to equity managers 24 percent to bond managers 3 percent to private equity managers and the remainder in money market instruments we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical 10year and 25year compounded annualized returns are 126 percent and 131 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the historical longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 875 percent expected return on assets for 2005 is reasonable 

  

the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension obligations is based on the average yield of moody’s aa corporate bonds the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 625 percent at december 31 2003 to 600 

  

percent at december 31 2004 we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

  

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2005 by approximately 17 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2005 net pension expense by approximately 13 million 

  

interest expense was 135 million in 2004 compared with 122 million in 2003 the 13 million increase in 2004 was the result of modestly higher debt levels and interest rates compared with 2003 interest expense in 2002 was 139 million exceeding both 2004 and 2003 as the reduction of debt resulting from our stock offering in may 2002 only impacted the last seven months of the year 

  

other net expense consists of bank fees interest income and other nonoperating items and has remained constant over the last three years at approximately 13 million 

  

our effective tax rate was 255 percent in 2004 339 percent in 2003 and 345 percent in 2002 the geographic composition of our 2004 pretax earnings resulted in a significant reduction in our effective tax rate as a greater proportion of earnings was recognized in the lowertaxed countries of china and mexico compared to the united states and europe the decline in the rate from 2002 to 2003 was due to the resolution of a federal tax audit in may 2003 

  

our 2004 net earnings declined to 354 million from 522 million in 2003 primarily as a result of significant increases in costs for steel and freight manufacturing inefficiencies at one of our water heater plants and higher sga expense earnings per share were 118 in 2004 compared with 176 in 2003 

  

electrical products 

  

sales in our electrical products segment in 2004 increased by 361 million to 8607 million from 8246 million in 2003 the increase was due to higher unit volumes and price increases related to higher costs for steel and freight sales to all of our served motor markets with the exception of heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac were more than ten percent higher than in 2003 hvac sales declined four percent in 2004 as a result of the loss of an important contract by one of our major oem customers sales in 2003 were 342 million higher than sales of 7904 million in 2002 due primarily to our 2002 acquisitions of athens products and the jiangsu changheng motor group co ltd 

  

operating earnings for our electrical products segment were 515 million in 2004 or 27 million less than 2003 the decrease was due primarily to higher costs for steel and freight and certain administrative expenses which more than offset the steel related price increases and benefits achieved by our product repositioning program operating earnings in 2003 were 542 million or 34 million less than 2002 due to pricing and manufacturing costs related to production repositioning to lower cost facilities 

  

water systems 

  

sales for our water systems segment were a record 7924 million in 2004 or 863 million higher than sales of 7061 million in 2003 the sales growth was driven by the introduction of higher efficiency residential water heaters higher prices related to higher steel and freight costs strong commercial volume a 37 percent increase in our china operations and additional flammable vapor ignition resistant product sales of 7061 million in 2003 increased by 274 million over sales of 6787 million in 2002 the increase was due to a january 2003 price increase to cover higher steel costs a 44 percent increase in china sales and the introduction of flammable vapor ignition resistant product partially offsetting these increases were lower unit sales of commercial and residential retail product 

  

operating earnings of 368 million in 2004 were 204 million lower than the 572 million earned in 2003 the significant benefits related to new product introductions and stronger commercial business were more than offset by raw material cost increases higher freight expenses manufacturing inefficiencies during the first nine months and higher selling expense operating earnings of 572 million in 2003 were slightly lower than the 584 million earned in 2002 most of the decline was associated with the flammable vapor ignition resistant product introduction costs in combination with lower sales of higher margin commercial product throughout the year 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the 

  

determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

  

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the recoverability of certain assets including goodwill and receivables resulting from the payment of claims associated with the dip tube class action lawsuit see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements as well as those estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity litigation product liability environmental matters and pensions and other postretirement benefits various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we constantly reevaluate these significant factors and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” and sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” we adopted sfas no 143 on january 1 2003 adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements sfas no 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

on december 16 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment which is a revision of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas no 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 95 statement of cash flows generally the approach in sfas no 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 123 however sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 

  

sfas no 123r must be adopted no later than july 1 2005 early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued we expect to adopt sfas no 123r on july 1 2005 

  

as permitted by sfas no 123 the company currently accounts for sharebased payments to employees using apb opinion no 25’s intrinsic value method and as such generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options accordingly the adoption of sfas no 123r’s fair value method could have a significant impact on our results of operations although it will have no impact on our overall financial position the impact of adoption of sfas no 123r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of sharebased payments granted in the future however had we adopted sfas no 123r in prior periods the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share earlier in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements sfas no 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on among other things when employees exercise stock options the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were 25 08 and 24 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

outlook 

  

we have implemented significant price increases in both of our businesses the most recent increases being effective with the beginning of this year these price increases have been put in place to offset the negative impact of material and freight cost increases while we are generally pleased with the impact and acceptance of the new price levels it is far too early to project their ultimate impact and acceptance accordingly we have determined that we will not provide a forecast of earnings per share at this time 

  

other matters 

  

environmental 

  

our operations are governed by a number of federal state and local environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2004 and are not expected to be material in any single year although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain 

  

compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

  

market risk 

  

we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency and certain commodities we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward and futures contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

commodity risks include raw material price fluctuations we use futures contracts to fix the cost of our expected needs for certain raw materials ie copper and aluminum with the objective of reducing price risk futures contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume levels which approximate expected usage at december 31 2004 we had commodity futures contracts amounting to 810 million of commodity purchases a hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity price of such contracts would have a potential impact of 81 million it is important to note that gains and losses from the company’s futures contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase transactions being hedged 

  

in addition we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2004 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 1192 million assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 119 million it is important to note that gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

  

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2004 we had 1175 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 24 percent at year end a hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of 03 million 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

this report contains statements that we believe are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as “may” “will” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “believe” “continue” or words of similar meaning these forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this release factors that could cause such a variance include the following significant increases in raw material prices competitive pressures on the company’s businesses instability in the company’s electric motor and water products markets adverse changes in general economic conditions and the potential that assumptions on which the company based its expectations are inaccurate or will prove to be incorrect 

  

forwardlooking statements included in this report are made only as of the date of this report and the company is under no obligation to update these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances all subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributed to the company or persons acting on its behalf are qualified entirely by these cautionary statements

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2004 and have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective to ensure that material information relating to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within those entities 

  

changes in internal controls 

  

there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect our disclosure controls and procedures nor were there any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls as a result no corrective actions were required or undertaken 

  

management report on internal control 

  

the management of a o smith corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting a o smith corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

  

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

  

a o smith corporation management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  based on our assessment we believe that as of december 31 2004 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

  

a o smith corporation’s independent auditors have issued an audit report on our assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting this report appears on page 38

the board of directors and stockholders 

ao smith corporation 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management report on internal control that a o smith corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria a o smith corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that a o smith corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion a o smith corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the coso criteria  

  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of a o smith corporation as of december 31 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated statements of earnings comprehensive earnings stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2004 and our report dated january 31 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

 item 1 — business we are a leading manufacturer of electric motors and water heating equipment serving a diverse mix of residential commercial and industrial end markets principally in the united states with a growing international presence our company is organized in two segments electrical products and water systems our electrical products business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of hermetic motors fractional horsepower alternating current ac and direct current dc motors and integral horsepower motors our water systems business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of residential gas and electric water heaters standard and specialty commercial water heating equipment highefficiency coppertube boilers and water systems tanks in 2003 we had net sales of approximately 15 billion with 54 percent attributable to our electrical products business and 46 percent attributable to our water systems business 

the following table summarizes our sales by operating segment this segment summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements which appear elsewhere in this document 

 electrical products our electrical products segment sales increased 34 million or 4 percent in 2003 to 825 million excluding the third quarter 2002 acquisition of athens products and the fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of jiangsu changheng group co ltd changheng of china segment sales were flat in 2003 

we are one of the three largest manufacturers of electric motors in north america having manufactured approximately 39 million electric motors in 2003 we offer a comprehensive line of hermetic motors fractional horsepower ac and dc motors and integral horsepower motors ranging in size from subfractional cframe ventilation motors up to 500 horsepower hermetic and 400 horsepower integral motors we believe our extensive product offering gives us an advantage in our targeted markets often allowing us to serve all of our customer’s electric motor needs over the last seven years we have significantly broadened our electric motor product line and customer base through a series of acquisitions including uppco general electric company’s domestic hermetic motor business magnetek’s electric motor business and the athens products division of electrolux 

our motors are used in a wide range of targeted residential commercial and industrial applications including hermetic motors that are sold worldwide to manufacturers of air conditioning and commercial refrigeration compressors fractional horsepower fan motors used in furnaces air conditioners and blowers fractional horsepower motors for pumps for home water systems swimming pools hot tubs and spas fractional horsepower motors used in other consumer products such as garage door openers and integral horsepower ac and dc motors for industrial and commercial applications sales to the heating ventilating air conditioning and refrigeration market account for approximately 60 percent of segment sales approximately 87 percent of our 2003 segment sales were to oems in a diverse mix of industries with the remainder of sales directed to the aftermarket or distribution channels sales to our largest customer york international and its wholly owned bristol compressors subsidiary were 157 million in 2003 and represented approximately 19 percent of segment sales we believe that more than 25 percent of our total segment sales were attributable to products used outside of the united states we estimate that approximately 60 percent of sales are derived from the less cyclical replacement business with the remainder being impacted by general business conditions in the retail and new construction markets 

to remain a leader in this highly competitive industry we are committed to being a lowcost supplier of electric motors we were one of the first motor manufacturers to identify the costreduction potential of mexican operations and today we manufacture a majority of our electric motors in our 16 mexican motor facilities in 2002 we undertook an initiative to accelerate the costreduction programs that were already underway in our motor operations to enhance our competitive position these initiatives included the closure of four domestic plants three of which were closed in 2003 the transfer of production to our lower cost operations in mexico and china and the consolidation of warehouse facilities into three hub operations to improve customer service while reducing cost and a ten percent reduction in the salaried workforce though the primary repositioning program has now been largely completed we intend to continue to optimize our operations in mexico and china by transferring production from higher to lower cost operations 

in december 2001 we acquired shenzhen speeda a manufacturer of subfractional horsepower electric motors in china in december 2002 we acquired the changheng motor group of changzhou china while changheng has an existing customer base in china the primary purpose of both the shenzhen and changheng acquisitions is to further expand our ability to manufacture products for the u s market in november 2003 we acquired taicang special motor co ltd taicang a manufacturer of hermetic motors for commercial air conditioning equipment taicang currently serves the chinese operations of a number of north american air conditioning companies and the purchase will enhance our position in the global hermetic motor market 

our principal competitors in the electric motor industry are emerson electric co and general electric company a number of other companies such as fasco motors a subsidiary of tecumseh products baldor electric regalbeloit corporation and jakel incorporated compete with us in specific segments of the electric motor market 

water systems our water systems business had sales in 2003 of 706 million which were four percent or 27 million higher than in 2002 the higher sales were the result of a 13 million increase in sales at our chinese water heater operation as well as improved pricing for new products and higher steel costs 

in december of 2001 we acquired the privately held water heater manufacturer state industries inc state for aggregate cash consideration of 1176 million this was comprised of a 613 million purchase price and the assumption of 563 million of debt the acquisition of state nearly doubled the sales of our water heating business 

we serve residential commercial and industrial end markets with a broad range of products including 

residential gas and electric water heaters  our residential water heaters come in sizes ranging from twogallon pointofuse models to 120gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges we offer traditional atmospheric water heaters as well as directvented and powervented models for today’s energy efficient homes domestic residential water heater sales in 2003 were approximately 445 million or 63 percent of segment revenues 

standard commercial water heaters  our gas oil and electric water heaters come in capacities ranging from 50 to 100 gallons and are used by customers who require a consistent economical source of hot water typical applications include restaurants hotels and motels laundries car washes and small businesses 

approximately 80 of the residential and commercial markets consist of the replacement of existing product although new construction is also an important factor for the business our water systems business also manufactures and markets specialty commercial water heaters coppertube boilers expansion tanks and related products and parts 

we are one of the two largest manufacturers and marketers of water heaters in north america manufacturing approximately 29 million units in 2003 we have a leading share in the commercial water heating segment and we believe we are the only domestic manufacturer that offers standard and specialty commercial water heater products we believe that our comprehensive commercial product line gives us a competitive advantage in this highermargin segment of the water heating industry we also are one of the leaders in the residential water heating segment with an extensive line of highefficiency gas and electric models 

government regulations are having a significant impact on the united states water heating industry beginning in july of 2003 united states water heater manufacturers were required to comply with new flammable vapor ignition resistant standards for residential gas water heaters these new regulations developed by the manufacturers in cooperation with the united states consumer product safety commission dictate that gas water heaters must be designed to protect against accidental ignition of flammable vapors caused by spilled gasoline or other liquids in addition a united states government requirement to increase the efficiency of residential gas and electric water heaters went into effect on january 20 th of this year 

our water systems wholesale distribution channel includes more than 2600 wholesale plumbing distributors that serve residential commercial and industrial markets we also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel in this channel our customers include four of the six largest national hardware and home center chains including a longstanding private label relationship with sears roebuck and co 

our principal domestic water heating competitors include rheem manufacturing company inc and to a lesser extent american water heater company and bradfordwhite corporation we also compete against a number of companies such as lochinvar corporation raypak inc teledyne laars jandy products a subsidiary of water pik technologies inc and many smaller regional competitors in certain segments of the united states water heater market as well as numerous competitors in international markets 

raw material raw materials for our manufacturing operations which consist primarily of steel copper and aluminum are generally available from several sources in adequate quantities we hedge the majority of our annual copper and aluminum purchases to protect against price volatility 

seasonality there is no significant seasonal pattern to our consolidated quarterly sales and earnings 

research and development patents and trademarks in order to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes we conduct research and development at our corporate technology center in milwaukee wisconsin as well as at our operating units total expenditures for research and development in 2003 2002 and 2001 were 346 304 and 276 million respectively 

we own and use in our businesses various trademarks trade names patents trade secrets and licenses while a number of these are important to us we do not consider a material part of our business to be dependent on any one of them 

employees our company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 17000 employees as of december 31 2003 

backlog normally none of our operations sustain significant backlogs 

environmental laws our operations are governed by a variety of federal state and local laws intended to protect the environment while environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures compliance with the environmental laws has not had a material effect and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of our company see item 3 

foreign sales total us export sales from our operations were 98 90 and 91 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively

 item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources we recorded net earnings of 522 million or 176 per share in 2003 compared with 513 million or 186 per share recorded in 2002 and 145 million or 61 per share in 2001 while net earnings were flat the lower earnings per share amount in 2003 as compared to 2002 reflects the full year impact of our stock offering in may 2002 the significant improvement in earnings in 2002 was primarily a result of costreduction actions in our electrical products business and synergies related to the acquisition of state industries inc state our individual segment performance will be discussed later in this section 

our working capital excluding shortterm debt see discussion below was 3059 million at december 31 2003 compared with 2251 million and 2216 million at december 31 2002 and december 31 2001 respectively the 808 million increase in 2003 reflects 466 million higher inventory balances due primarily to extensive manufacturing repositioning in our electric motor business and several new product introductions and manufacturing consolidation in our water systems business additionally receivable balances were 212 million higher due to price increases associated with new product introductions in our water systems business and an increase in international sales which tend to have longer payment terms finally a 131 million increase in accounts payable balances was almost completely offset by 94 million in restructuring expenses paid out in 2003 the small increase in working capital in 2002 was due to higher cash balances reducing working capital will be one of our major initiatives in 2004 

cash provided by operating activities during 2003 was 253 million compared with 1122 million during 2002 and 498 million in 2001 the higher investment in working capital during 2003 explains the majority of the difference between 2003 and 2002 significantly higher earnings levels and a 124 million tax refund in 2002 explain the majority of the improvement in 2002 cash provided by operating activities compared with 2001 with 2004 forecasted earnings of 220 to 240 per share and successful working capital reduction efforts we expect cash provided by operating activities to be approximately 120 to 140 million 

our capital expenditures were 449 million in 2003 compared with 425 million is 2002 and 353 million in 2001 the increase in 2003 was associated with new product launches in our water systems business the increase in 2002 was associated with our acquisition of state we are projecting 2004 capital expenditures to be between 45 and 50 million and to be slightly less than projected 2004 depreciation expense we believe that our present facilities and planned capital expenditures are sufficient to provide adequate capacity for our operations in 2004 

we have a 250 million credit facility with a group of nine financial institutions that expires on august 2 2004 borrowings under bank credit lines and in the commercial paper market are supported by the credit facility and have in the past been classified as longterm debt since the term of the facility at december 31 2003 is less than one year 968 million of debt has been classified as shortterm we expect to replace the credit facility during the second quarter of 2004 at december 31 2003 we had available borrowing capacity of 1532 million under this facility we believe that the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future 

to take advantage of historically low longterm borrowing rates we issued 500 million in senior notes with two insurance companies in june 2003 the notes range in maturity between 2013 and 2016 and carry a weighted average interest rate of slightly less than 45 percent the proceeds of the notes were used to repay commercial paper and borrowing under the credit facility our leverage as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 32 percent down slightly from 33 percent at the end of 2002 

aggregate contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2003 is as follows 

 we utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become “firm” until six weeks prior to the company’s scheduled unit production the purchase obligation amount included above represents the value of commitments considered firm 

our pension plans continue to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations and under current actuarial assumptions we do not expect any significant minimum funding requirements for several years see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

in 2002 we completed the sale of 48 million shares of our common stock at 2825 per share and paid down debt with the 1275 million net proceeds additionally during 2002 we recorded a 1147 million noncash charge to equity as a result of the accumulated benefit obligations of our pension plan exceeding the fair value of the plan assets 

in connection with acquisitions purchase liabilities were recorded at the respective acquisition dates for employee severance and relocation as well as certain facility exit costs see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements all restructuring activities related to our purchase liabilities were completed by december 31 2003 remaining balances as of that date for purchase liabilities relate to contractual obligations for future payments continuing severance payments to separated employees and facility sale costs 

included in other assets is a 340 million receivable due to the payments of claims associated with the dip tube class action lawsuit see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements the receivable is classified as a longterm asset because the trial to recover the receivable will not begin until early 2004 and while the trial will be concluded in 2004 the lawsuit may not be concluded until 2005 or later should there be an appeal of the trial court decision we expect to collect the receivable in 2005 through the satisfaction of a judgment favorable to the company alternatively collection could occur in 2004 if a settlement of the lawsuit is reached with the defendants perfection corporation american meter company and the insurance companies 

we have paid dividends for 64 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last twelve years we paid total dividends of 58 per share in 2003 compared with 54 per share in 2002 

results of operations our sales in 2003 were 153 billion an increase of 616 million or 42 percent from sales of 147 billion in 2002 the sales increase was due to a full year impact of our 2002 acquisitions in the motor business a 44 percent increase in sales at our chinese water heater operation and higher water heater pricing related to steel costs and the introduction of the new flammable vapor ignition resistant water heaters sales in 2002 increased by 3179 million or 276 percent from sales of 115 billion in 2001 the sales increase was due to our acquisitions of state in december 2001 and athens products athens in july 2002 see segment discussion below for further analysis 

our gross profit margin for 2003 was 195 percent compared with 204 percent and 176 percent in 2002 and 2001 respectively the decline in margin from 2002 to 2003 was attributable to approximately 40 million of sales from acquired businesses with margins lower than those of our established business the significant improvement in margin from 2001 to 2002 resulted from lower manufacturing costs associated with the product repositioning program at electrical products and the synergies from the state acquisition 

selling general and administrative expense sga was 2062 million in both 2003 and 2002 but as a percent of sales declined from 140 percent in 2002 to 135 percent in 2003 sga in 2002 increased by 605 million from the 1457 million recorded in 2001 primarily as a result of incremental sga associated with the state acquisition 

we have significant pension benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among other things discount rates expected return on plan assets retirement ages and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets was 90 percent in 2003 compared with 975 percent in 2002 our 2004 assumption for return on assets remains at 90 percent which should result in pension income recognition of approximately 73 million in 2004 we recognized pension income of 116 million 171 million and 201 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively reflected as reductions to cost of products sold and sga see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluate our pension plan’s target asset allocation the historical longterm rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is between 60 to 70 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers due to market fluctuations our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2003 was 72 percent to equity managers 24 percent to bond managers 3 percent to private equity managers and the remainder in money market instruments we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our pension plan’s historical 10year and 25year compounded annualized returns are 116 percent and 134 percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the historical longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns our 90 percent expected return on assets for 2004 is reasonable 

the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension obligations is based on the average yield of moody’s aa corporate bonds the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 675 percent at december 31 2002 to 625 percent at december 31 2003 we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary 

lowering the expected longterm rate of return on assets by 25 basis points would decrease our net pension income for 2004 by approximately 18 million lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would decrease our 2004 net pension income by approximately 13 million 

interest expense was 122 million in 2003 compared with 139 million and 164 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively decreasing interest rates throughout the past three years coupled with a significant reduction in debt resulting from our stock offering in may 2002 were responsible for the downward trend in interest expense see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

amortization of intangibles in 2003 and 2002 was 02 million and 03 million respectively which was significantly lower than the 70 million recorded in 2001 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” as of january 1 2002 under the new standard goodwill and indefinitelived assets are no longer amortized but instead are reviewed annually for impairment and accordingly goodwill amortization of 67 million in 2001 was not recorded in 2002 and 2003 see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

other expensenet consists of bank fees interest income and other nonoperating items and has remained relatively constant over the last three years in the range of 10 million to 14 million 

our effective tax rate was 339 percent in 2003 345 percent in 2002 and 355 percent in 2001 the effective rate in 2003 was favorably impacted by the resolution of a federal tax audit in may 2003 the effective rate in 2002 benefited from the implementation of a more efficient tax structure for international operations 

our 2003 net earnings improved slightly to 522 million from 513 million in 2002 despite slightly higher net earnings in 2003 earnings per share of 176 were ten cents lower than 2002 earnings per share of 186 as a result of the increased shares outstanding during 2003 due to the may 2002 stock offering 

electrical products sales in our electrical products segment in 2003 increased by 342 million to 8246 million from 7904 million in 2002 the increase was due primarily to our 2002 acquisitions of athens and the jiangsu changheng motor group co ltd changheng sales in 2002 were 123 million lower than sales of 8027 million in 2001 excluding approximately 20 million in sales attributable to the athens acquisition sales declined 320 million from 2001 to 2002 sales to the heating ventilating and air conditioning market excluding athens declined by 60 percent in 2002 and accounted for the majority of the total decrease in sales 

operating earnings for our electrical products segment were 542 million in 2003 or 34 million less than 2002 the decrease was attributable primarily to pricing and manufacturing costs related to the repositioning program while there was a delay in recognition of cost savings related to the 2003 repositioning activities we achieved significant results considering the number of simultaneous relocation activities during 2003 we closed three facilities including monticello indiana athens tennessee and ripley tennessee additionally we moved significant amounts of production from four other us facilities 

operating earnings in 2001 were 208 million inclusive of a nonrecurring pretax charge of 81 million and goodwill amortization expense of 67 million and compare with 2002 operating earnings of 576 million the 368 million increase in operating earnings from 2001 to 2002 was partially attributable to the 81 million nonrecurring charge and 67 million goodwill amortization incurred in 2001 with the remainder resulting from the cost reduction program announced in the fourth quarter of 2001 the program consisted of consolidation of warehouse facilities salaried workforce reduction and relocation of domestic production to mexico and china 

we are continuing to expand our motor production capacity in china and in november of 2003 completed the acquisition of taicang special motor co ltd near shanghai this acquisition will expand our motor manufacturing capability to include hermetic motors in china 

water systems sales for our water systems segment were 7061 million in 2003 or 274 million higher than sales of 6787 million in 2002 the sales growth was driven by a january 2003 price increase to cover higher steel costs a 44 percent increase in our chinese operations and the introduction of the new flammable vapor ignition resistant products these increases were partially offset by lower unit sales of commercial and residential retail product sales of 6787 million in 2002 increased by 3302 million over sales of 3485 million in 2001 our state acquisition contributed 3126 million with the remaining increase attributable to higher volume for the base residential and commercial business and the china operation 

operating earnings of 572 million in 2003 were slightly lower than the 584 million earned in 2002 most of the decline was associated with the flammable vapor ignition resistant product introduction costs in combination with lower sales of higher margin commercial product throughout the year the improvement in operating earnings from 392 million in 2001 to 584 million in 2002 was the result of the state acquisition and its related synergies as well as increased sales volume in the base business 

critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements 

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the recoverability of certain assets including goodwill and receivables resulting from the payment of claims associated with the dip tube class action lawsuit see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements as well as those estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity litigation product liability environmental matters and pensions and other postretirement benefits various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates the process of determining significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we constantly reevaluate these significant factors and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 

recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” and sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” we adopted sfas no 143 on january 1 2003 adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements sfas no 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

outlook as we look ahead to 2004 we have a strong base for performance the year 2003 was one of challenge and accomplishment during the year we transferred a substantial portion of our domestic motor manufacturing operations to lowercost facilities in mexico and china in the water heater business we undertook the most significant product line transformation in our history unfortunately accomplishing these transitions hurt profitability and resulted in lower operating cash flow due to increased working capital and restructuring expenditures restoring working capital to its proper level will be a major initiative in 2004 

in october we forecasted 2004 earnings of 240 to 260 per share the profit improvement in 2004 will be driven largely by the initiatives completed in 2003 in the motors business we expect a full year’s impact of the transition to mexico as well as the rampup in china will generate pretax earnings of 15 million in the water heater business a full year’s sales of flammable vapor ignition resistant product as well as the introduction of naeca compliant product is expected to generate 15 million pretax the focusing of commercial water heater production in our mcbee south carolina plant with residential product relocated to ashland city tennessee is expected to provide 5 million in pretax impact 

however in response to recent developments on january 21st of this year we adjusted our 2004 earnings guidance to a range between 220 and 240 per share from the previous range of 240 to 260 a share this change was due to raw material cost pressures particularly for steel and the loss of a sales contract by a major motor customer 

we expect first quarter earnings to approximate the 46 per share earned in the first quarter of 2003 

other matters environmental our operations are governed by a number of federal state and local environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2003 and are not expected to be material in any single year although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 

market risk we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency and certain commodities we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward and futures contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

commodity risks include raw material price fluctuations we use futures contracts to fix the cost of our expected needs for certain raw materials ie copper and aluminum with the objective of reducing price risk futures contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume levels which approximate expected usage at december 31 2003 we had commodity futures contracts amounting to 555 million of commodity purchases a hypothetical 10 percent change in the underlying commodity price of such contracts would have a potential impact of 56 million it is important to note that gains and losses from the company’s futures contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase transactions being hedged 

in addition we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2003 we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of 1324 million assuming a hypothetical 10 percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 132 million it is important to note that gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by shortterm money market rates at december 31 2003 we had 1033 million in outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 14 percent at year end a hypothetical 10 percent annual increase or decrease in the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of 01 million 

forwardlooking statements this report contains statements that we believe are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as “may” “will” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “believe” “continue” or words of similar meaning these forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this filing factors that could cause such a variance include the following instability in the company’s electric motor and water products markets inability to generate the synergistic cost savings from the acquisition of state industries the inability to implement costreduction programs adverse changes in general economic conditions significant increases in raw material prices competitive pressures on the company’s businesses and the potential that assumptions on which the company based its expectations are inaccurate or will prove to be incorrect 




 item 7a – quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see “market risk” above 




 item 9 – changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure none 




 item 9a – controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2003 and have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective to ensure that material information relating to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within those entities 

changes in internal controls there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect our disclosure controls and procedures nor were there any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls as a result no corrective actions were required or undertaken

item 1  business


we are a leading manufacturer of electric motors and water heating equipment
serving a diverse mix of residential commercial and industrial end markets
principally in the united states with a growing international presence our
company is organized in two segments electrical products and water systems our
electrical products business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of
hermetic motors fractional horsepower alternating current ac and direct
current dc motors and integral horsepower motors our water systems business
manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of residential gas and electric
water heaters standard and specialty commercial water heating equipment
highefficiency coppertube boilers and water systems tanks in 2002 we had
net sales of approximately 15 billion with 54 percent attributable to our
electrical products business and 46 percent attributable to our water systems
business

during the past six years we have significantly repositioned our company we
have changed from a diversified manufacturer with five businesses the largest
of which was our legacy automotive structural components business that
represented more than 50 percent of our total sales to a company focused on our
electrical products and water systems businesses which we believe offer the
opportunity for higher growth and more profitability

the following table summarizes our net sales by operating segment this segment
summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated
financial statements which appear elsewhere in this document

electrical products

our electrical products segment sales decreased 12 million or two percent in
2002 to 790 million excluding the third quarter 2002 acquisition of the
hermetic motor assets of the athens products athens division of the electrolux
group segment sales declined approximately 32 million or four percent the
decrease in sales in 2002 was primarily due to lower sales of motors to the
heating ventilating and airconditioning hvac market

we are one of the three largest manufacturers of electric motors in north
america having manufactured approximately 36 million electric motors in 2002
we offer a comprehensive line of hermetic motors fractional horsepower ac and
dc motors and integral horsepower motors ranging in size from subfractional
cframe ventilation motors up to 500 horsepower hermetic and 800 horsepower
specialty integral motors we believe our extensive product offering gives us an
advantage in our targeted markets often allowing us to serve all of our
customers electric motor needs we have significantly broadened our electric
motor product line and customer base through a series of acquisitions over the
last six years including

                                       2
page

uppco general electric companys domestic hermetic motor business magneteks
electric motor business and the hermetic motor assets of athens

our motors are used in a wide range of targeted residential commercial and
industrial applications including hermetic motors that are sold worldwide to
manufacturers of air conditioning and commercial refrigeration compressors
fractional horsepower fan motors used in furnaces air conditioners and
blowers fractional horsepower motors for pumps for home water systems swimming
pools hot tubs and spas fractional horsepower motors used in other consumer
products such as garage door openers and integral horsepower ac and dc motors
for industrial and commercial applications sales to the heating ventilating
air conditioning and refrigeration market account for more than 60 percent of
segment sales in july 2002 we expanded our presence in the hermetic motor
market by acquiring athens

approximately 85 percent of our 2002 segment sales were to original equipment
manufacturers oem in a diverse mix of industries with the remainder of sales
directed to the aftermarket or distribution channels sales to our largest
customer york international and its wholly owned bristol compressors
subsidiary were 173 million in 2002 and represented approximately 22 percent
of segment sales we believe that more than 25 percent of our total segment
sales were attributable to products used outside of the united states we
estimate that approximately 60 percent of the market is derived from the less
cyclical replacement business with the remainder being impacted by general
business conditions in the new construction market

to remain a leader in this highly competitive industry we are committed to
being a lowcost supplier of electrical products we were one of the first motor
manufacturers to identify the costreduction potential of mexican operations
and today we manufacture a majority of our electric motors in our 16 mexican
motor facilities in late 2001 we undertook an initiative to accelerate the
costreduction programs that were already underway in our motor operations to
enhance our competitive position these initiatives included transferring six
additional product manufacturing lines to our lowercost mexican operations
reducing salaried workforce by 10 percent and realigning our warehouse
facilities into three hub operations to improve customer service while reducing
cost in december 2001 we acquired shenzhen speeda a manufacturer of
subfractional horsepower electric motors in china in december 2002 we
acquired the motor manufacturing assets of jiangsu changheng group co ltd
changheng of changzhou china while changheng has an existing customer base
in china the primary purpose of the chinese acquisitions is to further expand
our ability to manufacture products for the us market

our principal competitors in the electric motor industry are emerson electric
co and general electric company a number of other companies such as fasco
motors baldor electric regalbeloit corporation and jakel incorporated
compete with us in specific segments of the electric motor market

water systems

our water systems business had sales in 2002 of 679 million 330 million
higher than 2001 sales of 349 million the higher sales were the result of 313
million in sales from the acquisition of state industries inc state
excluding state sales increased approximately 5 percent the majority of the
companys sales are in the less cyclical replacement market although the new
housing market is also an important market for the business

we serve residential commercial and industrial end markets with a broad range
of products including

residential gas and electric water heaters our residential water heaters come
in sizes ranging from twogallon pointofuse models to 120gallon appliances
with varying efficiency ranges we offer traditional atmospheric water heaters
as well as directvented and powervented models for todays energy efficient
homes domestic residential water heater sales in 2002 were 430 million or
approximately 63 percent of segment revenues

                                       3
page

standard commercial water heaters our gas oil and electric water heaters come
in capacities ranging from 50 to 100 gallons and are used by customers who
require a consistent economical source of hot water typical applications
include restaurants hotels and motels laundries car washes and small
businesses

our water systems business also manufactures and markets specialty commercial
water heaters coppertube boilers expansion tanks and related products and
parts

we are one of the two largest manufacturers and marketers of water heaters in
north america manufacturing more than three million units in 2002 we have a
leading share in the commercial water heating segment and we believe we are the
only domestic manufacturer that offers standard and specialty commercial water
heater products we believe that our comprehensive commercial product line gives
us a competitive advantage in this highermargin segment of the water heating
industry we also are one of the leaders in the residential water heating
segment with an extensive line of highefficiency gas and electric models we
significantly broadened our market scope and product offering with the
acquisition of state this acquisition allowed us to enter the retail segment of
the residential market a channel that represents approximately onehalf of the
total united states residential market the acquisition of state also enhanced
our position in the wholesale distribution channel and gave us a position in
several new distribution channels such as direct sales to large homebuilders
and the manufactured housing market

an increasing number of government regulations will have a significant impact on
the united states water heating industry in the coming years and we believe we
will benefit from our engineering expertise in this challenging environment
beginning in july of this year united states water heater manufacturers will be
required to comply with new flammable vapor ignition resistance standards for
virtually all residential gas water heaters these new standards and testing
protocols established by the american national standards institute ansi
require that gas water heaters deal with the accidental ignition of flammable
vapors such as emitted by spilled gasoline or other liquids other regulations
impacting our markets include restrictions on water heater emissions of nitrogen
oxides to date mandated only in california and texas and a united states
government requirement to increase the efficiency of residential gas and
electric water heaters by january 2004 we believe we will successfully comply
with these new regulations on a timely basis

our water systems wholesale distribution channel includes more than 2600
wholesale plumbing distributors that serve residential commercial and
industrial markets we also sell our residential water heaters through the
retail channel in this channel our customers include four of the six largest
national hardware and home center chains including a longstanding private
label relationship with sears roebuck and co

our principal domestic water heating competitors include rheem manufacturing
company inc and to a lesser extent american water heater company and
bradfordwhite corporation

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results

of operations


liquidity and capital resources
we recorded net earnings of 513 million or 186 per share in 2002
significantly higher than the 145 million or 61 per share earned in 2001
the significant improvement in earnings was primarily a result of cost reduction
actions in our electrical products business and integration activities related
to the acquisition of state the water systems business established new sales
and earnings records in 2002 individual segment performance will be discussed
later in this section

our working capital for continuing operations at december 31 2002 was 2281
million compared with 2198 million and 2043 million at december 31 2001 and
2000 respectively the increase in our working capital in 2002 was due to
higher cash balances and the increase in 2001 was due to the acquisition of
state in december 2001 cash flow from operating activities during 2002 was
1122 million compared with 498 million in 2001 significantly higher
earnings levels and a 124 million tax refund received in march 2002 explain
the majority of the improvement

our capital expenditures were 425 million in 2002 compared with 353 million
in 2001 and 405 million in 2000 the increase in 2002 was associated with our
acquisition of state the decrease in capital spending in 2001 occurred in our
electrical products business we are projecting 2003 capital expenditures to be
approximately 45 million and marginally lower than projected 2003 depreciation
expense our cash flow during 2003 is expected to adequately cover our projected
capital expenditures we believe that our present facilities and planned capital
expenditures are sufficient to provide adequate capacity for our operations in
2003

on may 10 2002 we completed the sale of 48 million shares of our common stock
through a public offering at a price of 2825 per share with the 1275
million net proceeds from our stock offering and operating cash flow we reduced
our debt by 1562 million from 4069 million at december 31 2001 to 2507
million at december 31 2002 our leverage as measured by the ratio of total
debt to total capitalization was 33 percent down significantly from 47 percent
at the end of 2001 excluding potential acquisitions we expect 2003 cash flow
to result in a yearend leverage ratio less than 30 percent

we expect to have adequate liquidity in 2003 as we have a minimal amount of
longterm debt maturing in addition we have a 2500 million multiyear
revolving credit facility with a group of nine financial institutions that
expires on august 2 2004 and an 825 million 364day credit facility with a
group of six banks that expires on july 25 2003 we expect these credit
facilities are adequate to support any shortterm borrowing needs at december
31 2002 we had available borrowing capacity of 2221 million under our credit
facilities for information about our contractual obligations for indebtedness
capital leases operating leases and related obligations as of december 31
2002 see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that
the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will
provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable
future

recent declines in the us equity market have resulted in a reduction in the
fair value of the assets of our pension plans this asset value reduction
coupled with an increase in the present value of the obligations of our pension
plans due to declining interest rates has resulted in accumulated pension
benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of the plan assets by 89 million
accordingly we took a noncash charge to equity of 115 million representing
the recording of this liability the elimination of the prepaid asset and
related deferred tax effects this charge has no impact on current cash flow or
net earnings our pension plans continue to meet all funding requirements under
erisa regulations and under current assumptions we do not expect any
significant minimum funding requirements for several years see note 12 of notes
to consolidated financial statements

in connection with our acquisition of athens in july 2002 we recorded purchase
liabilities of 42 million primarily for employee severance costs associated
with product manufacturing repositioning as of december 31 2002 we have
charged 11 million against this reserve in connection with the athens
acquisition and certain other acquisitions we recorded aggregate purchase
liabilities of 265 million at the respective acquisition dates for employee
severance and relocation as well as certain facility exit costs as of december
31 2002 we incurred and charged 171 million against these liabilities we
expect the majority of the activities to be completed by december 31 2003

included in other assets is a 340 million receivable due to the payments of
claims associated with the dip tube class action lawsuit see note 14 of notes
to consolidated financial statements we expect a modest increase to the
receivable in 2003 the receivable is classified as a longterm asset because
court proceedings will not begin until late 2003 and may not be concluded until
2004 or later

we have paid dividends for 63 consecutive years we paid total dividends of 54
per share in 2002 compared with 52 per share in 2001

results of operations

our sales in 2002 were 147 billion an increase of 3179 million or 276
percent from sales of 115 billion in 2001 the sales increase was due to our
acquisitions of state in december 2001 and athens in july 2002 as well as higher
sales in our base water heater business partially offset by a modest decline in
our electric motor business sales in 2001 decreased by 968 million or 78
percent from sales of 125 billion in 2000 the lower sales resulted from an
110 percent decline in our electrical products segment which more than offset
a slight increase in sales for our water systems business

our gross profit margin for 2002 was 204 percent compared with 176 percent
and 199 percent in 2001 and 2000 respectively the significant improvement in
margin from 2001 to 2002 resulted from lower manufacturing costs associated with
the product repositioning program at electrical products and the integration of
the state acquisition the decline in gross margin from 2000 to 2001 occurred
within our electrical products segment and was due primarily to underabsorption
of manufacturing costs associated with lower volume mexican wage inflation
throughout the year and increased costs for certain raw materials

selling general and administrative expense sga in 2002 was 2062 million
and increased by 605 million from the 1457 million recorded in 2001
primarily as a result of incremental sga associated with the state acquisition
sga in 2001 was 80 million lower than 2000 the decrease resulted from
volumerelated reductions in selling expense and cost reduction programs

we have significant pension benefit costs and credits that are developed from
actuarial valuations the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding among
other things discount rates expected return on plan assets retirement ages
and years of service consideration is given to current market conditions
including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions our assumption
for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets was 975 percent in 2002
compared with 100 percent in 2001 our 2003 assumption for return on assets
reflects a further reduction to 90 percent which should result in pension
income recognition of approximately 100 million in 2003 we recognized pension
income of 171 million 202 million and 177 million in 2002 2001 and
2000 respectively reflected as reductions to cost of products sold and sga
see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements

in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluated our
pension plans target asset allocation historical longterm rates of return of
equity and bond indices and actual historical returns of our pension plan our
plans target allocation to equity managers is 65 percent and the target
allocation to bond managers is 35 percent due to market fluctuations our
actual asset allocation as of december 31 2002 was 60 percent to equity
managers and 40 percent to bond managers we regularly review our actual asset
allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation
when considered appropriate we also considered our pension plans historical
10year and 25year compounded annualized returns of 108 percent and 127
percent respectively we believe that with our target allocation and the
historical longterm returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual
historical returns our 90 percent expected return on assets for 2003 is
reasonable

the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension obligations is
based on the average yield of moodys aa corporate bonds the discount rate
determined on this basis has decreased from 725 percent at december 31 2001
to 675 percent at december 31 2002 we will continue to evaluate our actuarial
assumptions at least annually and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary

interest expense was 139 million in 2002 compared with 164 million and
221 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively decreasing interest rates
throughout the past three years coupled with a significant reduction in debt
resulting from our stock offering in may 2002 were responsible for the downward
trend in interest expense see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial
statements

amortization of intangibles decreased to 03 million in 2002 from approximately
70 million in both 2001 and 2000 we adopted statement of financial accounting
standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible

                                       13
page

assets as of january 1 2002 under the new standard goodwill and
indefinitelived intangible assets are no longer amortized but instead are
reviewed annually for impairment and accordingly goodwill amortization of 67
million in 2001 and 2000 was not recorded in 2002 see note 8 of notes to
consolidated financial statements

other expense decreased slightly to 10 million from 14 million in 2001 the
11 million increase from 2000 to 2001 was due mostly to losses incurred on
forward foreign currency contracts

our effective tax rate was 345 percent in 2002 355 percent in 2001 and 360
percent in 2000 the effective rate in 2002 benefited from the implementation of
a more efficient tax structure for international operations the decline in the
rate from 2000 to 2001 resulted from increased research and state tax credits
partially offset by the negative impact of the losses in lowtax foreign
jurisdictions

we recorded net earnings of 513 million or 186 per share in 2002 compared
with 145 million or 61 per share in 2001 net earnings in 2001 included a
60 million aftertax special charge 25 on a per share basis related
primarily to the restructuring of our electric motor operation

electrical products
on july 1 2002 we purchased the hermetic motor assets of athens for
approximately 97 million athens based in athens tennessee is a
manufacturer of hermetic motors for both scroll and reciprocating compressors
this purchase is expected to generate incremental sales in 2003 of approximately
20 million and modest earnings in the second half of the year in the fourth
quarter of 2002 we also acquired the motor manufacturing assets of jiangsu
changheng group co ltd changheng for approximately 153 million changheng
is located in the jiangsu province of china and manufactures airmoving motors
for the chinese air conditioning market although changheng has an existing
customer base in china the primary purpose of the acquisition is to further
expand our ability to manufacture products for the us market see note 2 of
notes to consolidated financial statements

sales in our electrical products segment in 2002 were 7904 million 123
million lower than 2001 sales of 8027 million excluding approximately 20
million in sales attributable to the athens acquisition sales declined by 320
million from 2001 to 2002 sales to the heating ventilating and air
conditioning hvac market excluding athens declined by six percent in 2002
and accounted for the majority of the total decrease in sales sales in 2000
were 9024 million the hvac market experienced a decline of approximately 60
million or 11 percent from 2000 to 2001 the lower demand in 2001 was due to a
number of factors including general economic conditions reduced discretionary
spending on the part of consumers and inventory adjustments by air conditioning
manufacturers and retailers

operating earnings for our electrical products segment in 2002 were 576
million or 221 million higher than 2001 earnings adjusted to exclude goodwill
amortization expense of 67 million and special pretax charges of 81 million
in 2001 the increased earnings were primarily due to the cost reduction program
announced in the fourth quarter of 2001 the program consisted of three major
elements consolidation of warehouse facilities reduction of approximately 150
salaried employees and relocation of production from six domestic facilities to
mexico and china the combination of these actions was expected to generate
savings of 16 million in 2002 and 20 to 25 million annually thereafter
during 2002 we exceeded our goal and generated 19 million in firstyear
savings and project 2003 cost savings to exceed 25 million operating earnings
in 2000 were 755 million and compare with earnings of 289 million excluding
the special pretax charge of 81 million in 2001 the significant decline in
2001 earnings was due mostly to lower sales volume higher costs for raw
materials and mexican labor and more competitive market conditions

water systems
sales for our water systems segment were 6787 million in 2002 or 3302
million higher than sales of 3485 million in 2001 the state acquisition
contributed 3126 million of the increase the remaining increase was
attributable to higher volume for the base residential and commercial business
and the china operation the slight

                                       14
page
increase in 2001 sales from 3455 million in 2000 was due to higher sales of
residential products and growth in the china operation partially offset by
lower sales in other international markets

operating earnings for our water systems segment were 584 million or 179
million higher than 2001 earnings of 405 million before special charges the
higher earnings in 2002 were the result of the state acquisition and its related
synergies and increased sales volume in the base business the earnings
improvement from 349 million in 2000 to 405 million before special charges
in 2001 was the result of higher volume better performance in china and
improved plant efficiencies throughout the organization

during 2002 we moved the water systems segment headquarters from irving texas
to ashland city tennessee states headquarters to facilitate the integration
of the two businesses a special pretax charge of 13 million was recognized in
the fourth quarter of 2001 for lease and certain other costs associated with
this move

critical accounting policies
our accounting policies are described in note 1 of notes to consolidated
financial statements also as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute
certainty therefore the determination of estimates requires the exercise of
judgment actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates and such
differences may be material to the financial statements

the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our
financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the
recoverability of certain assets including goodwill and receivables resulting
from the payment of claims associated with the dip tube class action lawsuit
see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements as well as those
estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity
litigation product liability environmental matters and pensions and other
postretirement benefits various assumptions and other factors underlie the
determination of these significant estimates the process of determining
significant estimates is factspecific and takes into account factors such as
historical experience and trends and in some cases actuarial techniques we
constantly reevaluate these significant factors and adjustments are made when
facts and circumstances dictate historically actual results have not
significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described
above

recent accounting pronouncements
the financial accounting standards board has issued sfas no 143 accounting
for asset retirement obligations sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment
or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 146 accounting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities and sfas no 148 accounting for
stockbased compensation  transition disclosures sfas no 143 will become
effective for us on january 1 2003 adoption of this statement is not expected
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements sfas no
144 which was adopted on january 1 2002 has not had a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements since its adoption sfas no 146 will be
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements effective december 31 2002 we began making
the disclosures required under sfas no 148

outlook
our overall cost structure improved significantly during 2002 our operating
units will continue to aggressively manage cost in the new year and we remain
confident in our fullyear 2003 earnings estimate of between 205 and 225 per
share

while we are confident in the fullyear estimate earnings improvement will
occur primarily in the last half of the year cost increases including pension
employee medical costs and liability insurance will impact us throughout the
year operating improvements however will build up incrementally during the
year and are weighted to the last half of the year these improvements include
the continued success of the motor repositioning programs the ongoing impact of
the state integration activities and the introduction of new water heater
products for the first
                                       15
page

quarter of 2003 net earnings are projected to modestly surpass last years
121 million result however given the impact from our second quarter 2002
stock offering our first quarter earnings forecast of 41 to 45 per share
will fall short of last years figure of 50 per share

other matters

environmental
our operations are governed by a number of federal state and local
environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous
materials the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of
sites owned by the company or third parties we have expended financial and
managerial resources complying with such laws expenditures related to
environmental matters were not material in 2002 and are not expected to be
material in any single year although we believe that our operations are
substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to
maintain compliance there are no assurances that substantial additional costs
for compliance will not be incurred in the future however since the same laws
govern our competitors we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage

market risk
we are exposed to various types of market risks primarily currency and certain
commodities we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and
generally enter into forward and futures contracts to minimize such exposures
for periods of less than one year we do not engage in speculation in our
derivatives strategies further discussion regarding derivative instruments is
contained in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements

commodity risks include raw material price fluctuations we use futures
contracts to fix the cost of our expected needs with the objective of reducing
price risk futures contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume
levels which approximate expected usage at december 31 2002 we had commodity
futures contracts amounting to 56 million of commodity purchases a
hypothetical 10 percent change in the underlying commodity price of such
contracts would have a potential impact of 56 million it is important to note
that gains and losses from the companys futures contract activities will be
offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase transactions
being hedged

in addition we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the
effect of fluctuating foreign currencies at december 31 2002 we had net
foreign currency contracts outstanding of 940 million assuming a hypothetical
10 percent movement in the respective currencies the potential foreign exchange
gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to 94 million
it is important to note that gains and losses from our forward contract
activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions
being hedged

our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily
derived from outstanding floatingrate debt instruments that are determined by
shortterm money market rates at december 31 2002 we had 1169 million in
outstanding floatingrate debt with a weightedaverage interest rate of 20
percent at year end a hypothetical 10 percent annual increase or decrease in
the yearend average cost of our outstanding floatingrate debt would result in
a change in annual pretax interest expense of 02 million
