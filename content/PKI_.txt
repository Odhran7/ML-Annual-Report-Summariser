increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products 

we have agreements relating to the sale of our products and services to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts as well as other penalties 

we are also subject to a variety of laws regulations and standards that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products and our business practices in the united states and abroad such as antibribery anticorruption and competition laws in addition changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations this requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws regulations and standards 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include the handling transportation manufacture and disposal of toxic or hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 119 million and 129 million as of january 2 2022 and january 3 2021 respectively which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

human capital management 

as of january 2 2022 we employed approximately 16700 employees on a worldwide basis roughly 75 o f our workforce is based outside of the united states employees at several of our subsidiaries outside the united states belong to labor unions andor workers councils in those jurisdictions during fiscal year 2021 our voluntary turnover rate was roughly 10 we believe that management of our human capital resources is vital to the continued growth and success of the company

and we endeavor to create an environment that encourages productivity rewards performance and values diversity there are several ways in which we attempt to attract develop and retain highly qualified employees as set forth below 

our human capital objectives include as applicable identifying recruiting developing retaining incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees we strive to meet this objective by offering competitive compensation and benefits in a diverse inclusive and safe workplace with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers we hold our employees to high performance standards and our compensation plans are designed to deliver competitive base pay and attractive incentive opportunities our benefits programs are specifically tailored to the various countries in which we operate and maintain a significant workforce we benchmark for market practices and adjust our compensation and benefits programs to ensure they remain both equitable and competitive 

diversity and inclusion 

we believe in an inclusive workforce where employees from a number of cultures and countries are engaged and encouraged to leverage their collective talents we have employees in more than 40 countries around the world as of the date of filing of this annual report on form 10k women comprised roughly 30 of our leadership positions on a global basis which we define as director level and above we provided further information regarding our diversity demographics in our corporate social responsibility csr report and elsewhere on our website at wwwperkinelmercom including from our consolidated eeo1 report an eeo1 report is filed with the united states equal employment opportunity commission and describes the racial ethnic and gender composition of our usbased workforce information on our website including the csr report and the consolidated eeo1 report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report 

we understand that our ability to operate in a multicultural world is critical to our longterm value creation by maintaining a culture of diversity and inclusion we believe we can innovate more effectively to that end we seek to promote diverse perspectives throughout our organization and are an equal opportunity employer committed to making employment decisions without regard to race religion national or ethnic origin sex sexual orientation gender identity or expression age disability protected veteran status or other characteristics protected by law 

our commitment to diversity is evidenced by the establishment in 2020 of our internal inclusion and diversity committee which is comprised of a wide crosssection of leaders from all regions and backgrounds the committee focuses on driving increased diversity within our workforce as well as creating a safe and engaging platform for dialogue on these issues for all our employees our commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment is further validated by our employees as reflected in the results of our recent employee engagement survey where we received high scores in the areas of diversity  inclusion inclusiveness and nondiscrimination among other comments employees shared that they are proud of the emphasis perkinelmer places on diversity and inclusion and on making perkinelmer a place where everyone is valued and respected 

training and development 

we are committed to the continued development and training of our employees we seek to provide our employees with meaningful learning opportunities to help grow their capabilities and careers we provide learning through a variety of channels and formats including formal classroombased blended learning solutions digital learning and informal onthejob learning we are also dedicated to our employees’ professional development with a pivotal component of our annual performance review and goalsetting process focused on providing employees with constructive and actionable feedback as well as management support and engagement in the creation and completion of development goals our training opportunities are designed to promote learning across all levels of our organization we seek to provide opportunities for our employees to grow their careers and regularly fill open vacancies with internal candidates in addition management periodically assesses succession planning for certain key positions and reviews our workforce to identify high potential employees for future growth and development we also provide formal and informal training opportunities for our employees covering a variety of professional technical and leadership topics 

health and safety 

our success depends on the wellbeing of our employees and one of our top priorities is to protect the health and safety of our employees we maintain a culture focused on safety and strive to identify eliminate and control risk in the workplace to prevent injury and illness our employees have access to a global safety management system and are encouraged to report incidents near misses or other observations in the system the system has been widely adopted in our manufacturing locations across the globe and management uses the information generated by it to set safetyrelated policies and establish goals for future performance further we provide our employees with a comprehensive benefits package that includes health insurance and other resources that support their physical and mental wellbeing in response to the covid19 pandemic we have taken and we continue to take proactive aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees customers partners 

table of contents 

and suppliers we enacted rigorous safety measures including social distancing protocols encouraging employees who do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or in a lab to perform their work from home suspending nonessential travel implementing temperature checks and other access controls at the entrances to our facilities extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces and providing appropriate personal protective equipment to employees who are physically present at our facilities we expect to continue to implement these measures until the covid19 pandemic is adequately contained and we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers 

community 

at perkinelmer we have long held the view that responsible global citizenship along with good governance principles and ethical business practices are essential tenets for sustainability and success we encourage our employees to support the communities in which they live and where we operate and to assist in that effort we fund a longterm charitable matching program for our employees in addition we have established a group comprised of management and subject matter experts at our company to focus on developing and delivering on measurable advancements in the areas of reducing waste reducing carbon emissions and improving employee engagement and diversity 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

risks related to our business operations and industry 

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding restrictions in capital expenditures general economic conditions cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 “covid19” is having and may continue to have a negative effect on the demand for certain of our products and our global operations including our manufacturing capabilities logistics and supply chain that may materially and adversely impact our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows 

we face risks related to public health crises and pandemics including the covid19 pandemic the global impact of covid19 has resulted in an adverse impact on our operations supply chains and distribution systems as significant global mitigation measures including governmentdirected quarantines social distancing and shelterinplace mandates travel restrictions andor bans have been implemented and in some areas relaxed and then implemented again continued uncertainty with respect to the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic has contributed to the volatility of financial markets the covid19 pandemic has caused extended global economic disruption and a global recession is possible 

we have experienced significant reductions in demand for certain of our products due to the covid19 pandemic and although the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time additional impacts that we may experience include but are not limited to fluctuations in our stock price due to market volatility further decreases in demand for certain of our products reduced profitability largescale supply chain disruptions impeding our ability to ship andor receive product potential interruptions of or limitations on manufacturing operations imposed by local state or federal governments shortages of key raw materials or components workforce absenteeism and distraction labor shortages including those resulting from unwillingness to comply with vaccination or other requirements customer credit concerns cybersecurity 

table of contents 

risks and data accessibility disruptions due to remote working arrangements reduced sources of liquidity increased borrowing costs fluctuations in foreign currency markets potential impairment in the carrying value of goodwill other asset impairment charges increased obligations related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and deferred tax valuation allowances 

the rapid and continually evolving development of the covid19 pandemic and the extent to which mitigation measures will be effective preclude any prediction as to its ultimate impact however we currently anticipate that business disruptions and market volatility resulting from the covid19 pandemic will continue to have a material adverse impact on the growth rate of certain of our businesses and may also have a material adverse impact on our overall financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our diagnostics segment has experienced an increase in revenue resulting from increased demand for our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics covid19 product offerings as well as from the covid19 testing laboratory facilities we have developed with the state of california and the united kingdom we expect demand for these products and services to decline during 2022 with revenue and valuation of our inventory largely contingent upon consumer demand for covid19 testing as well as our ability to develop and produce covid19 products and successfully staff and manage the laboratories 

our growth is subject to global economic and political conditions and operational disruptions at our facilities 

our business is affected by global economic and political conditions as well as the state of the financial markets particularly as the united states and other countries balance concerns around debt inflation growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives there can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows results of operations financial position or our ability to access capital such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the united states and internationally our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes including war or other conflicts some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location 

while we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities a major earthquake fire flood power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments or other measures and some of these risks are insurable but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

• accurately anticipate customer needs 

• innovate and develop new reliable technologies and applications 

• receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner 

• successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner 

• price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time and 

• differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings 

table of contents 

many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or divestitures license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our recent acquisition of biolegend inc however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons such as 

• competition among buyers and licensees 

• the high valuations of businesses and technologies 

• the need for regulatory and other approval and 

• our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions 

some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition if for example we are unable to successfully commercialize products and services related to significant inprocess research and development that we have capitalized we may have to impair the value of such assets accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences loss of key personnel unforeseen regulatory requirements previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results additionally if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies which may adversely impact our profitability 

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed in the short term due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs as a result small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

• demand for and market acceptance of our products 

• competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices 

table of contents 

• changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business including as a result of covid19 and other global health crises or pandemics 

• changes in general economic conditions or government funding 

• settlements of income tax audits 

• expenses incurred in connection with claims related to environmental conditions at locations where we conduct or formerly conducted operations 

• contract termination and litigation costs 

• differing tax laws and changes in those laws or changes in the countries in which we are subject to taxation 

• changes in our effective tax rate 

• changes in industries such as pharmaceutical and biomedical 

• changes in the portions of our revenue represented by our various products and customers 

• our ability to introduce new products 

• our competitors’ announcement or introduction of new products services or technological innovations 

• costs of raw materials labor energy or supplies 

• changes in healthcare or other reimbursement rates paid by government agencies and other third parties for certain of our products and services 

• our ability to realize the benefit of ongoing productivity initiatives 

• changes in the volume or timing of product orders 

• fluctuation in the expense related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans 

• changes in our assumptions underlying future funding of pension obligations 

• changes in assumptions used to determine contingent consideration in acquisitions and 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including commercial airlines freight carriers national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the united states postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase including a service disruption as a result of the covid19 pandemic we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers in addition a global health crisis or pandemic such as the covid19 pandemic could have a significant adverse effect on our supply chain 

table of contents 

we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals tantalum tin gold tungsten and their derivatives that may be contained in our products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as a result of these rules we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the components used in our products be certified as conflictfree and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and scientists and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or those of our customers suppliers or other third parties or cybercrime resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or assets or if we fail to implement new systems software and technologies successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to develop manufacture and provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our and our thirdparty service providers information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers suppliers or other third parties it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems or cybercrime resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or assets could result in losses or misappropriation of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

as of january 2 2022 our total assets included 115 billion of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights customer relationships core technology and technology licenses and inprocess research and development net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “indefinitelived”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets 

adverse changes in our business adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units or the failure to grow our discovery  analytical solutions and diagnostics segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

risks related to our intellectual property 

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies the expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are 

table of contents 

filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

third parties have in the past and may in the future also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market or incur losses for failing to comply with our contractual obligations in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

risks related to legal government and regulatory matters 

the manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product and other liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product and other liability claims if our products services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies in the united states and abroad we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil criminal or monetary penalties 

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions some of our products are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

we are also subject to a variety of laws regulations and standards that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances the collection storage transfer use disclosure retention and other processing of personal data and our business practices in the united states and abroad such as antibribery anticorruption and competition laws this requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws regulations and standards a failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety data privacy and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our 

table of contents 

products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our foreign operations 

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2021 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in actual or from projected foreign currency exchange rates 

• a global health crisis of unknown duration such as the covid19 pandemic 

• wars conflicts or other changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions particularly in developing or emerging markets 

• longer payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions 

• trade protection measures including embargoes sanctions and tariffs such as the sanctions recently implemented by the us and other governments on the russian federation and related parties the extent and impact of which have yet to be fully determined 

• import or export licensing requirements and the associated potential for delays or restrictions in the shipment of our products or the receipt of products from our suppliers 

• policies in foreign countries benefiting domestic manufacturers or other policies detrimental to companies headquartered in the united states 

• differing tax laws and changes in those laws or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax 

• adverse income tax audit settlements or loss of previously negotiated tax incentives 

• differing business practices associated with foreign operations 

• difficulty in transferring cash between international operations and the united states 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor laws and changes in those laws 

• differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection 

• expanded enforcement of laws related to data protection and personal privacy 

• increasing global enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption laws and 

• differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements 

table of contents 

the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union could adversely impact our results of operations 

nearly 10 of our net sales from continuing operations in fiscal year 2021 came from the united kingdom following the referendum vote in the united kingdom in june 2016 in favor of leaving the european union on january 31 2020 the country formally withdrew from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” and on december 24 2020 the united kingdom and the european union entered into a trade and cooperation agreement to govern the relationship between the united kingdom and the european union following brexit the potential effects of brexit remain uncertain brexit has caused and may continue to create volatility in global stock markets and regional and global economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom financial and banking markets weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm our business and if such conditions worsen in the united kingdom or in the rest of europe it may have a material adverse effect on our operations and sales 

any significant weakening of the great britain pound to the us dollar will have an adverse impact on our european revenues due to the importance of our sales in the united kingdom currency exchange rates in the pound sterling and the euro with respect to each other and the us dollar have already been adversely affected by brexit and that may continue to be the case 

risks related to our debt 

we have a substantial amount of outstanding debt which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business 

  

we have a substantial amount of debt and other financial obligations our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

• requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and stock repurchases 

• reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions 

• exposing us to interest rate risk as a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates 

• increasing our foreign currency risk as a portion of our debt obligations are in denominations other than the us dollar and 

• increasing the chances of a downgrade of our debt ratings due to the amount or intended purpose of our debt obligations 

we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs if we add new debt the risks described above could increase in addition the market for both public and private debt offerings could experience liquidity concerns and increased volatility as a result of the covid19 pandemic which could ultimately increase our borrowing costs and limit our ability to obtain future financing

we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments

discontinuation reform or replacement of libor may adversely affect our variable rate debt 

our indebtedness under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan credit facility bear interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us dollars in july 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 the discontinuation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of us dollar libor 1month 3month 6month and 12month was subsequently extended by the ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor until june 30 2023 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2023 the alternative reference rates committee in the united states has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” calculated using shortterm repurchase agreements backed by us treasury securities is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to us dollar libor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to libor if libor is discontinued reformed or replaced we expect that our indebtedness under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan credit facility will be indexed to a replacement benchmark based on sofr any such change could cause the effective interest rate under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan credit facility and our overall interest expense to increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected

overview of fiscal year 2021 

during fiscal year 2021 we continued to see strong returns from our acquisitions as well as our organic investments across technology marketing and people our overall revenue in fiscal year 2021 increased 12844 million or 34 as compared to fiscal year 2020 reflecting an increase of 8650 million or 42 in our diagnostics segment revenue and an increase o f 4194 million or 24 in our discovery  analytical solutions segment revenue revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed 2197 million to the increase in our overall revenue during fiscal year 2021 the increase in our diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2021 was primarily driven by increased demand for our covid19 product offerings resulting in an increase of 7490 million in our immunodiagnostics revenue our diagnostics segment revenue also increased during fiscal year 2021 due to growth in our core product offerings resulting in an increase of 619 million in our reproductive health revenue and an increase of 542 million in our applied genomics revenue revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed 955 million to the increase in our diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2021 the increase in our discovery  analytical solutions segment revenue during fiscal year 2021 was driven by an increase of 3051 million in our life sciences market revenue and an increase of 1143 million in our applied markets revenue revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed 1243 million to the increase in our discovery  analytical solutions segment revenue during fiscal year 2021 

in our diagnostics segment we experienced tremendous demand for our immunodiagnostics covid19 product offerings particularly in the americas partially offset by a decline in demand for these product offerings in the asiapacific region we also experienced strong growth in our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics core product and service offerings across all regions in our reproductive health business an expanded range of product offerings and increased geographic reach more than offset the impact of declining birthrates 

in our discovery  analytical solutions s egment the increase in our life sciences market revenue was the result of an increase in revenue in our pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets as well as an increase in revenue from our informatics business the increase in our applied markets revenue was driven by increased demand from our industrial environmental and food markets 

our consolidated gross margins increased 49 basis points in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily due to higher sales volume a favorable shift in product mix and continued productivity initiatives to improve our supply chain partially offset by increased amortization expense our consolidated operating margin increased 42 basis points in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily due to higher sales volume leverage and increased sales of our covid19 products offerings which were partially offset by increased amortization of intangible assets investments in new product development and growth initiatives 

overall we believe that our strategic priorities and recent portfolio transformations coupled with our expanded range of product offerings leading market positions global scale and financial strength provides us with a foundation for continued revenue growth strong margins and cash flows and longterm earnings per share growth

revenue for fiscal year 2021 was 29319 million as compared to 20669 million for fiscal year 2020 an increase of 8650 million or 42 which includes an appro ximate 5 increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and divestitures and a 2 increase in revenue attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contribute d 955 million to the increase in our dia gnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2021 as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules we did not recognize 08 million of revenue for each of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods the increase in our diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2021 was primarily driven by increased demand for our covid19 product offerings resulting in an increase of 7490 million in our immunodiagnostics revenue our diagnostics segment revenue also increased during fiscal year 2021 due to growth in our core product offerings resulting in an increase of 619 million in our reproductive health revenue and an increase of 542 million in our applied genomics revenue

liquidity and capital resources 

we require cash to pay our operating expenses make capital expenditures make strategic acquisitions service our debt and other longterm liabilities repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock our principal sources of funds are cash flows from our operations borrowing capacity available under our senior unsecured credit facility and access to the debt markets we anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses capital expenditures smaller acquisitions interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock however we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due any larger acquisitions and other longterm liabilities such as contributions to our postretirement benefit plans 

we and our subsidiaries and affiliates may from time to time in our sole discretion purchase repay redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities including any publicly issued debt securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions by tender offer or otherwise or extend or refinance any of our outstanding indebtedness 

principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include 

• changes in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services and 

• changes in our working capital requirements 

principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include 

• financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity 

• increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt 

• a ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market 

• increases in interest rates or credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis 

• a decrease in the market price for our common stock and 

• volatility in the public debt and equity markets

borrowing arrangements 

see note 13 debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our borrowing arrangements 

dividends 

our board of directors our board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 007 per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 resulting in an annual dividend rate of 028 per share at january 2 2022 we had accrued 88 million for a dividend declared in october 2021 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 that was paid in february 2022 on january 27 2022 we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 that will be payable in may 2022 in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources 

table of contents 

capital expenditures 

during fiscal year 2022 we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2021 primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

other potential liquidity considerations 

at january 2 2022 we had cash and cash equivalents of 6183 million of which 5263 million was held by our nonus subsidiaries and we had 15 billion of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility we had no other liquid investments at january 2 2022 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed we use our nonus cash for needs outside of the us including foreign operations 

capital investments acquisitions and repayment of debt in addition we also transfer cash to the us using nontaxable returns of capital distributions of previously taxed income as well as dividends where the related income tax cost is managed efficiently 

prior to enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act we did not provide deferred income tax expense on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries at december 31 2017 we accrued for a onetime transition tax expense of 850 million on our unremitted foreign earnings in accordance with the tax act the us treasury subsequently issued regulations on the tax act and we recorded tax expense benefit of 27 million and 46 million during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively we continue to make our scheduled tax payments associated with this onetime transition tax expense accrual 

as of january 2 2022 we evaluated our undistributed foreign earnings and identified approximately 12 billion in earnings that we no longer considered indefinitely reinvested we intend to begin repatriating such earnings to the us in whole or in part during fiscal year 2022 in doing so we have recorded a provision of approximately 371 million for the us federal us state and nonus taxes that would fall due when such earnings are repatriated no additional income tax expense has been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested 

on july 31 2020 our board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to 2500 million under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program the repurchase program will expire on july 27 2022 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2021 we repurchased 433000 shares of common stock under the repurchase program at an aggregate cost of 626 million as of january 2 2022 1874 million remained available for aggregate repurchases of shares under the repurchase program 

in addition our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans during fiscal year 2021 we repurchased 71248 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 105 million during fiscal year 2020 we repurchased 72251 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 69 million 

the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

as of january 2 2022 we may have to pay contingent consideration related to acquisitions with open contingency periods of up to 1084 million as of january 2 2022 we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 580 million of which 13 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 567 million was recorded in longterm liabilities the expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed 69 years from january 2 2022 and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at january 2 2022 was 54 years 

distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability creating increased volatility in security prices widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in credit spreads as well as limitations on the 

table of contents 

availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets with respect to plans outside of the united states we expect to contribute 70 million in the aggregate during fiscal year 2022 during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 we contributed 69 million and 75 million in the aggregate to pension plans outside of the united states respectively during fiscal year 2021 we contributed 200 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states for the plan year 2019 we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans 

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and are subject to various claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in our opinion based on our review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these contingencies at january 2 2022 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us see “business—environmental matters ” above and note 16 contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these matters and proceedings 

effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 nature of operations and accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to accounting for business combinations longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles and employee compensation and benefits we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities as sumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques for intangible assets we normally utilize the income method which incorporates the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows attributable to the subject intangible asset adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams depending on the asset valued the key assumptions included one or more of the following 1 future revenue growth rates 2 future gross margin 3 future selling general and administrative expenses 4 royalty rates 5 customer attrition rates and 6 discount rates if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period 

table of contents 

value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment operating lease right of use assets investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimates of fair values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 

for goodwill the test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using a measurement date of january 4 2021 and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment at january 4 2021 the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 200 for each reporting unit except for our tulip reporting unit which had a fair value that was between 10 and 20 more than its carrying value the range of the longterm terminal growth rates for the reporting units was 30 to 50 for the fiscal year 2021 impairment analysis the range for the discount rates for the reporting units was 80 to 125 keeping all other variables constant a 100 change in any one of these input assumptions for the vari ous reporting units except for our tulip reporting unit would still allow us to conclude that there was no impairment of goodwill at january 2 2022 the operating performance of our tulip reporting unit exceeded the original forecast and the forecast for this reporting unit no longer indicates any sensitivity that would lead to a material impairment charge 

we consistently employ the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce tax rates capital spending discount rates and working capital changes cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years’ cash flows and historical relationships in later years the income approach is sensitive to changes in longterm terminal growth rates and the discount rates the longterm terminal growth rates are consistent with our historical longterm terminal growth rates as the current economic trends are not expected to affect our longterm terminal growth rates we corroborate the income approach with a market approach while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future 

employee compensation and benefits we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar monthend that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement 

we recognized a gain of 309 million in fiscal year 2021 and a loss of 180 million in fiscal year 2020 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans which include the charge or benefit for the marktomarket adjustment for the benefit plans which was recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the loss or income related to the marktomarket adjustment on benefit plans was a pretax gain of 247 million in fiscal year 2021 and a pretax loss of 254 million in fiscal year 2020 we expect income of approximately 54 million in fiscal year 2022 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans excluding the charge for or benefit from the marktomarket adjustment it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a marktomarket adjustment in fiscal year 2022 marktomarket adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control including changes in interest rates the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease markto market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2022 conversely to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected markto market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2022 pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year we use discount rates for each individual plan based upon the expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments derivatives marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january 2 2022 

we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only and includes derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments by nature all financial instruments involve market and credit risks we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on these foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows 

principal hedged currencies include the australian dollar british pound euro indian rupee singapore dollar and swedish krona we held forward foreign exchange contracts designated as economic hedges with us dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling 3719 million at january 2 2022 8080 million at january 3 2021 and 2776 million at december 29 2019 and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material the duration of these contracts was generally 30 days or less during each of fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 

in addition in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance its acquisitions and stock repurchase program we enters into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies we record these hedges at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on these hedges as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges which were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements included combined us dollar notional amounts of 3602 million as of january 2 2022 combined euro notional amounts of €334 million and combined us dollar notional amounts of 4990 million as of january 3 2021 and combined euro notional amounts of €1058 million and combined us dollar notional amounts of 56 million as of december 29 2019 the net gains and losses on these derivatives combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material 

during fiscal year 2018 we designated a portion of the 2026 notes to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries unrealized translation adjustments from a portion of the 2026 notes were included in the foreign currency translation component of aoci which offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries the cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold as of january 2 

table of contents 

2022 the total notional amount of the 2026 notes that was designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was €4972 million the unrealized foreign exchange gains losses recorded in aoci related to the net investment hedge were 332 million 496 million and 49 million during the fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

during fiscal year 2019 we entered into a crosscurrency swap designated as a net investment hedge to hedge the euro currency exposure of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries this agreement is a contract to exchange fixedrate payments in one currency for fixedrate payments in another currency changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded in equity as a component of aoci in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments in assessing the effectiveness of this hedge we use a method based on changes in spot rates to measure the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on both its foreign subsidiary net investment and the related swap under this method changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument other than those due to changes in the spot rate are initially recorded in aoci as a translation adjustment and then are amortized into other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations using a systematic and rational method over the instrument’s term changes in the fair value associated with the effective portion ie those changes due to the spot rate are recorded in aoci as a translation adjustment and are released and recognized in earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the hedged net investment the crosscurrency swap had an initial notional value of €1974 million or 2200 million and matured on november 15 2021 interest on the crosscurrency swap was payable semiannually in euro on may 15th and november 15th of each year based on the euro notional value and a fixed rate of 247 we received interest in us dollars on may 15th and november 15th of each year based on the us dollar equivalent of the euro notional value and a fixed rate of 500 

during fiscal year 2020 we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the 2021 notes the effective portion of the gain or loss of the cash flow hedges were reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 we redeemed all of its outstanding 2021 notes and settled the forward foreign exchange contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges the foreign exchange losses gains recorded in earnings related to the cash flow hedges were 95 million and 293 million d ur ing the fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively 

during fiscal year 2021 we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge a portion of the 2026 notes the effective portion of the gain or loss of the cash flow hedges will be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 we settled the forward foreign exchange contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges the foreign exchange loss recorded in earnings related to the cash flow hedges was 87 million during fiscal year 2021 

during fiscal year 2021 we entered into two interest rate swaption agreements together the “swaptions” with expiration dates of september 30 2021 in anticipation of issuing notes to fund the acquisition of biolegend the first swaption had a term of 2 months and hedged an anticipated 10year note offering with a notional value of 5000 million the second swaption had a term of 2 months and hedged an anticipated 7year note offering with a notional value of 5000 million we designated the swaptions as qualifying hedging instruments and accounted for these derivatives as cash flow hedges on september 8 2021 we sold both swaptions and as a result recognized a loss of 82 million in interest and other expense net during the fiscal year 2021 we also recorded other comprehensive income of 38 million which will be amortized to interest and other expense net over the 7 and 10 year terms respectively of the related permanent financing 

we do not expect any material net pretax gains or losses to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss income into interest and other expense net within the next twelve months 

see note 19 derivatives and hedging activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities 

market risk 

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 60 of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the 

table of contents 

united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in natural hedges 

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be positively but not proportionately impacted conversely when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be negatively but not proportionately impacted 

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days as of january 2 2022 this computation estimated that there is a 5 chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 31500 this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2021 the valueatrisk ranged between 01 million and 04 million with an average of approximately 03 million 

interest rate risk as of january 2 2022 we had 5000 million in outstanding borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit and term loan facilities amounts drawn under our senior unsecured revolving credit and term loan facilities bear interest at variable rates all of our other debt bear interest at fixed rates our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 6183 million at january 2 2022 fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

interest rate risk—sensitivity  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

i changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows to fluctuate an increase of 10 or approximately 12 basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 06 million for fiscal year 2022 

ii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

marketing 

all of our businesses market their products and services primarily through their own specialized sales forces as of january 3 2021 we employed approximately 5500 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 38 countries and marketing products and services in more than 190 countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

raw materials key components and supplies 

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with our suppliers for certain critical raw materials key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components see the applicable risk factor in “item 1a risk factors” for an additional description of this risk 

intellectual property 

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and 

knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties 

  

competition 

due to the range and diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors our competitors range from foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to more narrowly focused firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation operational efficiency product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market positions we expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

regulatory affairs 

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies some of our products are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of our product activities and if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we may face among other things warning letters adverse publicity investigations or notices of noncompliance fines injunctions and civil penalties import or export restrictions partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions increased difficulty in obtaining required fda clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products 

we have agreements relating to the sale of our products and services to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts as well as other penalties 

we are also subject to a variety of laws regulations and standards that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products and our business practices in the united states and abroad such as antibribery anticorruption and competition laws in addition changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations this requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws regulations and standards 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include the handling transportation manufacture and disposal of toxic or hazardous substances the 

remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 129 million and 77 million as of january 3 2021 and december 29 2019 respectively which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

human capital management 

as of january 3 2021 we employed approximately 14000 employees on a worldwide basis roughly 80 o f our workforce is based outside of the united states several of our subsidiaries outside the united state are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils that involve approximately 3600 of our employees during fiscal year 2020 our voluntary turnover rate was 978 we believe that management of our human capital resources is vital to the continued growth and success of the company and we endeavor to create an environment that encourages productivity rewards performance and values diversity there are several ways in which we attempt to attract develop and retain highly qualified employees as set forth below 

our human capital objectives include as applicable identifying recruiting developing retaining incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees we strive to meet this objective by offering competitive compensation and benefits in a diverse inclusive and safe workplace with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers we hold our employees to high performance standards and our compensation plans are designed to deliver competitive base pay and attractive incentive opportunities our benefits programs are specifically tailored to the various countries in which we operate and maintain a significant workforce we benchmark for market practices and adjust our compensation and benefits programs to ensure they remain both equitable and competitive 

diversity and inclusion 

the company believes in an inclusive workforce where employees from a number of cultures and countries are engaged and encouraged to leverage their collective talents we have employees in over 40 countries around the world as of the date of filing of this annual report on form 10k women comprised roughly 30 of our leadership positions on a global basis which we define as director level and above we expect to provide further information regarding our diversity demographics in our corporate social responsibility csr report or elsewhere on our website at wwwperkinelmercom including summarized data from our eeo1 form an eeo1 form is a report filed with united states equal employment opportunity commission describing the racial ethnic and gender composition of our usbased workforce information on our website including the csr report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report 

we understand that our ability to operate in a multicultural world is critical to our longterm value creation by maintaining a culture of diversity and inclusion we believe that we are able to innovate more effectively to that end we seek to promote diverse perspectives throughout our organization and are an equal opportunity employer committed to making employment decisions without regard to race religion national or ethnic origin sex sexual orientation gender identity or expression age disability protected veteran status or other characteristics protected by law our commitment to diversity is evidenced by the establishment of a new internal inclusion and diversity committee in fiscal year 2020 the committee is comprised of a wide crosssection of the companys leaders across all regions and backgrounds with a focus on driving increased diversity within our workforce as well as creating a safe and engaging platform for dialogue on these issues for all of our employees 

training and development 

we are committed to the continued development and training of our employees we seek to provide our employees with meaningful learning opportunities to help grow their capabilities and careers we provide learning through a variety of channels and formats including formal classroombased blended learning solutions digital learning and informal onthejob learning we are also dedicated to our employees’ professional development with a pivotal component of our annual performance review and goalsetting process focused on providing employees with constructive and actionable feedback as well as management support and engagement in the creation and completion of development goals our training opportunities are designed to promote learning across all levels of our organization we seek to provide opportunities for our employees to grow their careers and regularly fill open vacancies with internal candidates in addition management periodically assesses succession planning for certain key positions and reviews our workforce to identify high potential employees for future growth and development we also provide formal and informal training opportunities for our employees covering a variety of professional technical and leadership topics 

health and safety 

our success depends on the wellbeing of our employees and one of our top priorities is to protect the health and safety of our employees we maintain a culture focused on safety and strive to identify eliminate and control risk in the workplace in an effort to prevent injury and illness our employees have access to a global safety management system and are encouraged to report incidents near misses or other observations in the system the system has been widely adopted in our manufacturing locations across the globe and management uses the information generated by it to set safetyrelated policies and to set goals for future performance further we provide our employees with a comprehensive benefits package that includes health insurance and other resources that support their physical and mental wellbeing in response to the covid19 pandemic we have taken and we continue to take proactive aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees customers partners and suppliers we enacted rigorous safety measures including social distancing protocols encouraging employees who do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or in a lab to perform their work from home suspending nonessential travel implementing temperature checks and other access controls at the entrances to our facilities extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces and providing appropriate personal protective equipment to employees who are physically present at our facilities we expect to continue to implement these measures until the covid19 pandemic is adequately contained and we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers 

community 

at perkinelmer we have long held the view that responsible global citizenship along with good governance principles and ethical business practices are essential tenets for sustainability and success we encourage our employees to support the communities in which they live and where we operate and to assist in that effort we funded a longterm charitable matching program for our employees in addition we have established a group comprised of management and subject matter experts at the company to focus on developing and delivering on measurable advancements in the areas of reducing waste reducing carbon emissions and improving employee engagement and diversity 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

risks related to our business operations and industry 

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding restrictions in capital expenditures general economic conditions cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 “covid19” is having and may continue to have a negative effect on the demand for certain of our products and our global operations including our manufacturing capabilities logistics and supply chain that may materially and adversely impact our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows 

we face risks related to public health crises and pandemics including the covid19 pandemic that was first reported in china in december 2019 and has since spread to all geographic regions where our products are produced and sold the global impact of covid19 has resulted in an adverse impact on our operations supply chains and distribution systems as significant global mitigation measures including governmentdirected quarantines social distancing and shelterinplace mandates travel restrictions andor bans have been implemented and in some areas relaxed and then implemented again continued uncertainty with respect to the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic has contributed to the volatility of financial markets the covid19 pandemic has caused extended global economic disruption and a global recession is possible 

we have experienced significant reductions in demand for certain of our products in our discovery  analytical solutions segment due to the covid19 pandemic and although the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time additional impacts that we may experience include but are not limited to fluctuations in our stock price due to market volatility further decreases in demand for certain of our products reduced profitability largescale supply chain disruptions impeding our ability to ship andor receive product potential interruptions of or limitations on manufacturing operations imposed by local state or federal governments shortages of key raw materials workforce absenteeism and distraction labor shortages customer credit concerns cybersecurity risks and data accessibility disruptions due to remote working arrangements reduced sources of liquidity increased borrowing costs fluctuations in foreign currency markets potential impairment in the carrying value of goodwill other asset impairment charges increased obligations related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and deferred tax valuation allowances 

the rapid and continually evolving development of the covid19 situation and the extent to which ongoing mitigation measures will be effective precludes any prediction as to its ultimate impact however we currently anticipate that business disruptions and market volatility resulting from the covid19 pandemic will continue to have a material adverse impact on the growth rate of certain of our businesses particularly within the discovery  analytical solutions segment and may also have a material adverse impact on our overall financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our diagnostics segment has experienced an increase in revenue resulting from increased demand for our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics covid19 product offerings as well as from the covid19 testing laboratory facilities we have developed with the state of california and the united kingdom the increased demand for these products is expected to continue into the first half of our fiscal year 2021 but the overall sustainability of the increase in associated revenue remains largely contingent upon consumer demand for covid19 testing as well as our ability to develop and produce covid19 products and successfully staff and manage the laboratories 

our growth is subject to global economic and political conditions and operational disruptions at our facilities 

our business is affected by global economic and political conditions as well as the state of the financial markets particularly as the united states and other countries balance concerns around debt inflation growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives there can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows results of operations financial position or our ability to access capital such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the united states and internationally our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location 

while we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities a major earthquake fire flood power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments or other measures and some of these risks are insurable but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

• accurately anticipate customer needs 

• innovate and develop new reliable technologies and applications 

• receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner 

• successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner 

• price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time and 

• differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings 

many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or divestitures license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our recent acquisition of horizon discovery group plc however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons such as 

• competition among buyers and licensees 

• the high valuations of businesses and technologies 

• the need for regulatory and other approval and 

• our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions 

some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition if for example we are unable to successfully commercialize products and services related to significant inprocess research and development that we have capitalized we may have to impair the value of such assets accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences loss of key personnel unforeseen regulatory requirements previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results additionally if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies which may adversely impact our profitability 

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed in the short term due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs as a result small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

• demand for and market acceptance of our products 

• competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices 

• changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business including as a result of covid19 and other global health crises or pandemics 

• changes in general economic conditions or government funding 

• settlements of income tax audits 

• expenses incurred in connection with claims related to environmental conditions at locations where we conduct or formerly conducted operations 

• contract termination and litigation costs 

• differing tax laws and changes in those laws or changes in the countries in which we are subject to taxation 

• changes in our effective tax rate 

• changes in industries such as pharmaceutical and biomedical 

• changes in the portions of our revenue represented by our various products and customers 

• our ability to introduce new products 

• our competitors’ announcement or introduction of new products services or technological innovations 

• costs of raw materials energy or supplies 

• changes in healthcare or other reimbursement rates paid by government agencies and other third parties for certain of our products and services 

• our ability to realize the benefit of ongoing productivity initiatives 

• changes in the volume or timing of product orders 

• fluctuation in the expense related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans 

• changes in our assumptions underlying future funding of pension obligations 

• changes in assumptions used to determine contingent consideration in acquisitions and 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including commercial airlines freight carriers national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the united states postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase including a service disruption as a result of the covid19 pandemic we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers in addition a global health crisis or pandemic such as the covid19 pandemic could have a significant adverse effect on our supply chain 

we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals tantalum tin gold tungsten and their derivatives that may be contained in our products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as a result of these rules we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the components used in our products be certified as conflictfree and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs 

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and scientists and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or those of our customers suppliers or other third parties or cybercrime resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or assets or if we fail to implement new systems software and technologies successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to develop manufacture and provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our and our thirdparty service providers information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers suppliers or other third parties it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems or cybercrime resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or assets could result in losses or misappropriation of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

as of january 3 2021 our total assets included 48 billion of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights customer relationships core technology and technology licenses and inprocess research and development net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets 

adverse changes in our business adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units or the failure to grow our discovery  analytical solutions and diagnostics segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

risks related to our intellectual property 

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies the expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

third parties have in the past and may in the future also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market or incur losses for failing to comply with our contractual obligations in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

risks related to legal government and regulatory matters 

the manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product and other liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product and other liability claims if our products services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies in the united states and abroad we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil criminal or monetary penalties 

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions some of our products are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

we are also subject to a variety of laws regulations and standards that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances the collection storage transfer use disclosure retention and other processing of personal data and our business practices in the united states and abroad such as antibribery anticorruption and competition laws this requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws regulations and standards a failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety data privacy and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our foreign operations 

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2020 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in actual or from projected foreign currency exchange rates 

• a global health crisis of unknown duration such as the covid19 pandemic 

• changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions particularly in developing or emerging markets 

• longer payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions 

• trade protection measures including embargoes and tariffs such as the tariffs recently implemented by the us government on certain imports from china and by the chinese government on certain imports from the us the extent and impact of which have yet to be fully determined 

• import or export licensing requirements and the associated potential for delays or restrictions in the shipment of our products or the receipt of products from our suppliers 

• policies in foreign countries benefiting domestic manufacturers or other policies detrimental to companies headquartered in the united states 

• differing tax laws and changes in those laws or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax 

• adverse income tax audit settlements or loss of previously negotiated tax incentives 

• differing business practices associated with foreign operations 

• difficulty in transferring cash between international operations and the united states 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor laws and changes in those laws 

• differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection 

• expanded enforcement of laws related to data protection and personal privacy 

• increasing global enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption laws and 

• differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements 

the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union could adversely impact our results of operations 

nearly 10 of our net sales from continuing operations in fiscal year 2020 came from the united kingdom following the referendum vote in the united kingdom in june 2016 in favor of leaving the european union on january 31 2020 the country formally withdrew from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” and on december 24 2020 the united kingdom and the european union entered into a trade and cooperation agreement to govern the relationship between the united kingdom and the european union following brexit the potential effects of brexit remain uncertain brexit has caused and may continue to create volatility in global stock markets and regional and global economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom financial and banking markets weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm our business and if such conditions worsen in the united kingdom or in the rest of europe it may have a material adverse effect on our operations and sales 

any significant weakening of the great britain pound to the us dollar will have an adverse impact on our european revenues due to the importance of our sales in the united kingdom currency exchange rates in the pound sterling and the euro with respect to each other and the us dollar have already been adversely affected by brexit and that may continue to be the case 

risks related to our debt 

we have a substantial amount of outstanding debt which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business 

  

we have a substantial amount of debt and other financial obligations our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

• requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and stock repurchases 

• reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions 

• exposing us to interest rate risk as a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates 

• increasing our foreign currency risk as a portion of our debt obligations are in denominations other than the us dollar and 

• increasing the chances of a downgrade of our debt ratings due to the amount or intended purpose of our debt obligations 

we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs if we add new debt the risks described above could increase in addition the market for both public and private debt offerings could experience liquidity concerns and increased volatility as a result of the covid19 pandemic which could ultimately increase our borrowing costs and limit our ability to obtain future financing 

restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility senior unsecured notes due in 2021 2021 notes senior unsecured notes due in 2026 2026 notes and senior unsecured notes due in 2029 2029 notes include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company these include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

• pay dividends on redeem or repurchase our capital stock 

• sell assets 

• incur obligations that restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to make dividend or other payments to us 

• guarantee or secure indebtedness 

• enter into transactions with affiliates and 

• consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 

we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments 

any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility the 2021 notes the 2026 notes the 2029 notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances 

discontinuation reform or replacement of libor may adversely affect our variable rate debt 

our indebtedness under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility bears interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us dollars in july 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee in the united states has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to us dollar libor for 

use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to libor if libor is discontinued reformed or replaced we expect that our indebtedness under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility will be indexed to a replacement benchmark based on sofr any such change could cause the effective interest rate under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall interest expense to increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our share price will fluctuate 

over the last several years stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 

• operating results that vary from our financial guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors 

• the financial performance of the major end markets that we target 

• the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us 

• announcements of strategic developments acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors 

• changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions such as interest or foreign exchange rates commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets and 

• changes to economic conditions arising from global health crises such as the covid19 pandemic 

dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

on october 22 2020 we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 that was paid in february 2021 on january 28 2021 we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 that will be payable in may 2021 in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

overview of fiscal year 2020 

during fiscal year 2020 we continued to see strong returns from our acquisitions as well as our organic investments across technology marketing and people our overall revenue in fiscal year 2020 increased 8991 million or 31 as compared to fiscal year 2019 reflecting an increase of 9294 million or 82 in our diagnostics segment revenue partially offset by a decrease of 304 million or 2 in our discovery  analytical solutions segment revenue the increase in our diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2020 was primarily driven by increased demand for our covid19 product offerings resulting in an increase of 5474 million from our immunodiagnostics revenue and an increase of 3983 million from our applied genomics revenue partially offset by a decrease of 162 million from our reproductive health revenue the decrease in our discovery  analytical solutions segment during fiscal year 2020 was driven by a decrease of 854 million from our applied markets revenue partially offset by an increase of 550 million from our life sciences market revenue 

in our diagnostics segment we experienced tremendous demand for our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics covid19 product and service offerings across all regions in our reproductive health business an expanded range of product offerings and increased geographic reach partially offset the impact of declining birthrates 

in our discovery  analytical solutions s egment the decrease in our applied markets revenue was driven by reduced demand as a result of the covid19 pandemic resulting in a decrease in revenue from our industrial environmental and food markets the increase in our life sciences market revenue was the result of an increase in revenue in our pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets driven by continued growth of our informatics and onesource businesses partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our academia and governmental markets 

our consolidated gross margins increased 736 basis points in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily due to higher sales volume favorable shift in product mix and continued productivity initiatives to improve our supply chain partially offset by increased amortization expense our consolidated operating margin increased 1332 basis points in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily due to higher sales volume which was partially offset by increased amortization of intangible assets investments in new product development and growth initiatives 

o verall we believe that our strategic priorities and recent portfolio transformations coupled with our expanded range of product offerings leading market positions global scale and financial strength provides us with a foundation for continued growth 

consolidated results of operations 

  fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses for fiscal year 2020 were 2054 million as compared to 1893 million for fiscal year 2019 an increase of 161 million or 85 as a percentage of revenue research and development expenses decreased to 54 in fiscal year 2020 as compared to 66 in fiscal year 2019 primarily driven by outsized volume increases stockbased compensation expense was 12 million in fiscal year 2020 as compared to 11 million in fiscal year 2019 in addition to the above items the increase in research and development expenses was driven by investments in new product development 

restructuring and other costs net 

we have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures the alignment of our operations with our growth strategy and the integration of our business units and productivity initiatives restructuring and other costs net were 80 million for fiscal year 2020 as compared to 294 million for fiscal year 2019 

we implemented a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 consisting of workforce reductions and closure of excess facilities principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives the q1 2020 plan we implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives q3 2020 plan we implemented a restructuring plan in each quarter of fiscal year 2019 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives the q1 2019 plan q2 2019 plan q3 2019 plan and q4 2019 plan respectively all other previous restructuring plans were workforce reductions or the closure of excess facility space principally intended to integrate our businesses in order to realign operations reduce costs achieve operational efficiencies and shift resources into geographic regions and end markets that are more consistent with our growth strategy the previous plans 

the following table summarizes the number of employees reduced the initial restructuring or contract termination charges by operating segment and the dates by which payments were substantially completed or the expected dates by which payments will be substantially completed for restructuring actions implemented during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 in continuing operations 



we expect to make payments under the previous plans for remaining residual lease obligations with terms varying in length through fiscal year 2022 

we also have terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges to the extent applicable for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us we recorded additional pretax charges of 02 million during each of fiscal years 2020 and 2019 in the discovery  analytical solutions segment and 01 million and 02 million during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively in the diagnostics segment as a result of these contract terminations 

we recorded pretax charges of 43 million and 08 million associated with relocating facilities during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 

interest and other expense net 

interest and other expense net consisted of the following 



interest and other expense net for fiscal year 2020 was 722 million as compared to 1248 million for fiscal year 2019 a decrease of 526 million the decrease in interest and other expense net in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was largely due to a decrease in debt extinguishment costs of 325 million primarily associated with the redemption of the november 2021 notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 a decrease of 139 million in interest expense related to the full year benefit of the lower interest rate on the 2029 notes that replaced the november 2021 notes a decrease in other expense net of 42 million primarily due to a decrease in pensionrelated expenses and a decrease in loss on disposition of businesses and assets net of 25 million a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates on continuing operations were 197 and 40 for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively certain of our subsidiaries have at various times been granted tax relief in their respective countries resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates a reconciliation of income tax expense at the us federal statutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended 



  the variation in our effective tax rate for each year is primarily a result of the recognition of earnings in foreign jurisdictions predominantly finland singapore and the united kingdom in fiscal year 2020 and finland singapore and the netherlands in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 which are taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate resulting in a benefit from income t axes of 425 million in fiscal year 2020 and 167 million in fiscal year 2019 these amounts include 218 million in fiscal year 2020 and 104 million in fiscal year 2019 of benefits derived from tax holidays in china and singapore the effect of these benefits derived from tax holidays on basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2020 was 020 and 019 resp ectively and for fiscal year 2019 was 009 and 009 respectively the tax holiday in china is renewed every three years the company expects to renew the tax holiday for two of our subsidiaries in china that expired in fisc al year 2020 the tax holiday for one of our subsidiaries in singapore is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2023 

disposition of businesses and assets 

as part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have discontinued certain businesses when the discontinued operations represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations any business deemed to be a discontinued operation prior to the adoption of accounting standards update 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity continues to be reported as a discontinued operation and the results of operations and related cash flows are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented any remaining assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of january 3 2021 and december 29 2019

acquisitions in fiscal year 2018 

for a discussion of our acquisitions for fiscal year 2018 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 29 2019 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 25 2020 

as of january 3 2021 the allocations of purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were final the preliminary allocations of the purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2020 were based upon initial valuations our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete our valuations within the measurement periods which are up to one year from the respective acquisition dates the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain 

tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances and residual goodwill we expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition dates during the measurement periods during the measurement periods we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of those dates these adjustments will be made in the periods in which the amounts are determined and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition dates all changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement periods are also included in current period earnings 

during fiscal year 2020 we obtained information relevant to determining the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to recent acquisitions and adjusted our purchase price allocations based on this information we recognized an increase in intangible assets of 19 million an increase in deferred tax liabilities of 04 million a decrease in goodwill of 18 million and a decrease in liabilities assumed of 04 million 

allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period 

as of january 3 2021 we may have to pay contingent consideration related to acquisitions with open contingency periods of up to 73 million as of january 3 2021 we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 30 million of which 29 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 01 million was recorded in longterm liabilities as of december 29 2019 we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 355 million of which 208 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 147 million was recorded in longterm liabilities the expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed 29 years from january 3 2021 and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at january 3 2021 was 19 years if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of definitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional contingent consideration which would be recognized as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations 

in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin thereon the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services we do not include any costs associated with selling effort research and development or the related margins on these costs in most acquisitions profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition the sum of the costs and operating income approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a thirdparty to assume the obligation 

contingencies including tax matters 

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 129 million and 77 million as of january 3 2021 and december 29 2019 respectively in accrued expenses and other current liabilities which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the 

environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

various tax years after 2010 remain open to examination by certain jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such as china finland germany luxembourg the netherlands singapore the united kingdom and the united states the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 

we are subject to various claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in our opinion based on our review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these contingencies at january 3 2021 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

liquidity and capital resources 

we require cash to pay our operating expenses make capital expenditures make strategic acquisitions service our debt and other longterm liabilities repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets particularly the debt markets we anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses capital expenditures smaller acquisitions interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock however we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due any larger acquisitions and other longterm liabilities such as contributions to our postretirement benefit plans 

principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include 

• changes in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services and 

• changes in our working capital requirements 

principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include 

• financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity 

• increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt 

• a ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market 

• increases in interest rates or credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis 

• a decrease in the market price for our common stock and 

• volatility in the public debt and equity markets

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january 3 2021 for continuing and discontinued operations purchase commitments are minimal and have been excluded from this table 



 

1 the credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates as of january 3 2021 the senior unsecured revolving credit facility had a carrying value of 1560 million 

2 the 2021 notes include interest obligations of 06 million as of january 3 2021 the 2021 notes had a carrying value of 3662 million 

3 the 2026 notes include interest obligations of 635 million as of january 3 2021 the 2026 notes had a carrying value of 6047 million 

4 the 2029 notes include interest obligations of 2441 million as of january 3 2021 the 2029 notes had a carrying value of 8406 million 

5 the other debt facilities include interest obligations of 04 million as of january 3 2021 the other debt facilities had a carrying value of 232 million 

6 employee benefit payments only include obligations through fiscal year 2030 

7 we do not expect to cash settle any uncertain tax positions during fiscal year 2021 we have excluded 388 million related to uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments 

as of january 3 2021 we may have to pay the former shareholders of certain of our acquisitions contingent consideration of up to 73 million the table above does not reflect any of these obligations as the timing and amounts are uncertain for further information related to our contingent consideration obligations see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

capital expenditures 

during fiscal year 2021 we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2020 primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost 

locations and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

other potential liquidity considerations 

at january 3 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 4020 million of which 3452 million was held by our nonus subsidiaries and we had 8304 million of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility we had no other liquid investments at january 3 2021 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed we use our nonus cash for needs outside of the us including foreign operations 

capital investments acquisitions and repayment of debt in addition we also transfer cash to the us using nontaxable returns of capital distributions of previously taxed income as well as dividends where the related income tax cost is managed efficiently we have accrued tax expense on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries as required by the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” and also where the foreign earnings are not considered permanently reinvested in accordance with the tax act we are making scheduled annual cash payments on our accrued transition tax the tax cost and related tax payments are not expected to be material to the execution of our business investment and acquisition strategies 

on july 23 2018 our board of directors the board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to 2500 million under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program the repurchase program expired on july 23 2020 and no shares remain available for repurchase under the repurchase program due to its expiration on july 31 2020 the board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to 2500 million under a new stock repurchase program the new repurchase program the new repurchase program will expire on july 27 2022 unless terminated earlier by the board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2020 we had no stock repurchases under either the repurchase program or the new repurchase program as of january 3 2021 2500 million remained available for aggregate repurchases of shares under the new repurchase program subsequent to fiscal year 2020 we repurchased 233000 shares of common stock under the new repurchase program at an aggregate cost of 336 million 

in addition our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans during the fiscal year 2020 we repurchased 72251 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 69 million during fiscal year 2019 we repurchased 68536 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 63 million 

the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the new repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

subsequent to fiscal year 2020 we reached an agreement with oxford immunotec global plc “oxford immunotec” on terms under which we agreed to acquire oxford immunotec it is intended that the acquisition will be implemented by means of a uk high court of justicesanctioned scheme of arrangement under part 26 of the uk companies act 2006 between oxford immunotec and its shareholders the “scheme” under the terms of the acquisition oxford immunotec shareholders will be entitled to receive 22 in cash for each outstanding ordinary share the terms of the acquisition value oxford immunotec’s entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital at approximately 5910 million the scheme has been approved by the shareholders of oxford immunotec subject to the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions we currently anticipate that the transaction will close later this month the acquisition will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability creating increased volatility in security prices widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets with respect to plans outside of the united states we expect to contribute 76 million in the aggregate during fiscal year 2021 during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 we contributed 75 million and 82 million in the aggregate to pension plans outside of the united states respectively during fiscal year 2021 we contributed 200 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states for the plan year 2019 we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans 

effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 nature of operations and accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition warranty costs bad debts inventories accounting for business combinations and dispositions longlived assets pensions and other postretirement benefits restructuring income taxes contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations we recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the promised products or services when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of those products or services to customers 

taxes that are collected by us from a customer and assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenueproducing transaction are excluded from revenue 

the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period 

  allowances for doubtful accounts   prior to december 30 2019 we maintained allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments beginning on december 30 2019 we maintain an allowance for current expected credit loss on trade receivables that when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the trade receivables presents the net amount expected to be collected on trade receivables under the new model we segment our receivables and contract assets based on days past due and record an allowance for current expected credit losses using average rates applied against each accounts applicable aggregate balance for each aging bucket we establish the average rates based on consideration of the actual credit loss experience over the prior 3year period recent collection trends current economic conditions and reasonable expectations of future payment delinquency therefore if the economic conditions and financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for current expected credit loss this would reduce our earnings accounts are writtenoff only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted 

  inventory valuation we value inventory at the lower of cost or market inventories are accounted for using the firstin firstout method we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic 

levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest iprd is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period 

value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment operating lease right of use assets investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using a measurement date of january 1 2020 and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment at january 1 2020 the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 200 for each reporting unit except for our meizheng group reporting unit the range of the longterm terminal growth rates for the reporting units was 30 to 50 for the fiscal year 2020 impairment analysis the range for the discount rates for the reporting units was 90 to 145 keeping all other variables constant a 100 change in any one of these input assumptions for the various reporting units except for our meizheng group reporting unit would still allow us to conclude that there was no impairment of goodwill the fair value of our meizheng group reporting unit approximated its carrying value given that the reporting unit was a relatively new acquisition at january 4 2021 our tulip reporting unit which had a goodwill balance of 778 million at january 3 2021 had a fair value that was between 10 and 20 more than its carrying value tulip is at increased risk of an impairment charge given its ongoing weakness due to the impact of covid19 despite the increased risk associated with this reporting unit we do not believe there will be a significant change in the key estimates or assumptions driving the fair value of this reporting unit that would lead to a material impairment charge 

we consistently employed the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce tax rates capital spending discount rates and working capital changes cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years’ cash flows and historical relationships in later years the income approach is sensitive to changes in longterm terminal growth rates and the discount rates the longterm terminal growth rates are consistent with our historical longterm terminal growth rates as the current economic trends are not expected to affect our longterm terminal growth rates we corroborate the income approach with a market approach while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future 

nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test we consistently employed the relief from royalty model to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of nonamortizing intangible asset the impairment 

test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the nonamortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a nonamortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of the amortizing intangible asset in addition we evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible asset at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of our nonamortizing intangible asset is no longer indefinite the asset will be tested for impairment this intangible asset will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 

we performed our annual impairment testing as of january 1 2020 and concluded that there was no impairment of the nonamortizing intangible asset an assessment of the recoverability of amortizing intangible assets takes place when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment no such events occurred during fiscal year 2020 

employee compensation and benefits we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar monthend that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement 

we recognized losses of 180 million and 261 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans which include the charge or benefit for the marktomarket adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans which was recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the loss or income related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans was a pretax loss of 254 million in fiscal year 2020 and 312 million in fiscal year 2019 we expect income of approximately 103 million in fiscal year 2021 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans excluding the charge for or benefit from the marktomarket adjustment it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a marktomarket adjustment in fiscal year 2021 marktomarket adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control including changes in interest rates the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease markto market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2021 conversely to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected markto market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2021 pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year beginning in fiscal year 2016 the approach we use to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for certain nonus benefit plans was changed to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs prior to fiscal year 2016 we calculated these service and interest components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in fiscal year 2016 we have elected to utilize an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period 

as of january 3 2021 we estimate the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 725 and to be 210 for all plans outside the united states in addition as of january 3 2021 we estimate the discount rate for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 221 and to be 092 for all plans outside the united states during fiscal year 2019 the society of actuaries issued an updated projection scale mp2019 which incorporated an additional year 2017 of us population data and reduced the life expectancy used to determine the projected benefit obligation we adopted mp2019 as of december 30 2019 the adoption of mp2019 resulted in a 44 million decrease to the projected benefit obligation at december 29 2019 during fiscal year 2020 the society of actuaries issued an updated projection scale mp2020 which incorporated an additional year 2018 of us population data and made a few adjustments to the longterm rate of mortality improvement assumed we adopted mp2020 as of january 3 2021 the adoption of mp2020 resulted in a 27 million decrease to the projected benefit obligation at january 3 2021 the changes to the projected benefit obligations due to the adoption of the new projection scale are included within actuarial loss gain in the change in benefit obligations for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 above we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to 

be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date 

if any of our assumptions were to change as of january 3 2021 our pension plan expenses would also change 



we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and contractual agreements ii costs of terminating contracts in connection with certain disposal activities before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us  iii costs to relocate facilities and iv impairment of assets as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled “restructuring and other costs net” 

dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation which meets the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated any such changes decrease or increase current earnings during the fiscal year ended january 3 2021 we had no disposition of discontinued operations 

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine our current tax provision as well as enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled to determine our deferred tax provision any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

the tax act made broad and complex changes to the us internal revenue code which included reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the end of the measurement period for purposes of staff 

accounting bulletin no 118 was december 22 2018 we have completed the analysis based on legislative updates relating to the tax act currently available and have recorded the impact in tax expense from continuing operations 

we are subject to the global intangible low tax income gilti tax rules that are part of the modified territorial tax system imposed by the tax act under us gaap we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes the “deferred method” we adopted the period cost method and thus have not recorded any potential deferred tax effects related to gilti in our financial statements for the fiscal year ended january 3 2021 

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

additionally we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards state income tax credit carryforwards and certain foreign tax attributes valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in t he valuation allowance with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision 

prior to enactment of the tax act we did not provide deferred income tax expense on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries the tax act required us to accrue a onetime transition tax on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2017 we recorded an income tax expense of 850 million in continuing operations in accordance with the tax act the us treasury issued regulations in 2019 and accordingly we refined our calculations of the onetime transition tax and recorded a tax expense benefit of 27 million and 46 million during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively at the end of fiscal year 2020 we evaluated our undistributed foreign earnings and identified certain earnings that we no longer consider indefinitely reinvested and therefore recognized 16 million of income tax expense during the year our intent is to continue to reinvest the remaining undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries indefinitely no additional deferred income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested however should we change our business plans in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of our us subsidiaries we will recognize additional income tax liabilities as of january 3 2021 we have approximately 15 billion of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the us indefinitely and for which no additional incremental us tax cost has been provided it is not practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to such incremental tax costs on those earnings 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments derivatives marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january 3 2021 

we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments by nature all financial instruments involve market and credit risks we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments approximately 70 of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can increase the costs of financing investing and operating the business 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows 

principal hedged currencies include the brazilian real british pound chinese yuan euro indian rupee singapore dollar and swedish krona we held forward foreign exchange contracts designated as economic hedges with us dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling 8080 million at january 3 2021 2776 million at december 29 2019 and 2233 million at december 30 2018 and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material the duration of these contracts was generally 30 days or less during each of fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 

in addition in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance our acquisitions and stock repurchase program we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies we record these hedges at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on these hedges as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges which were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements included combined euro notional amounts of €334 million and us dollar notional amounts of 4990 million as of january 3 2021 combined euro notional amounts of €1058 million and combined us dollar notional amounts of 56 million as of december 29 2019 and combined euro notional amounts of €373 million and combined us dollar notional amounts of 57 million as of december 30 2018 the net gains and losses on these derivatives combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material for each of the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 we paid 46 million and 13 million during the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively from the settlement of these hedges 

during fiscal year 2018 we designated a portion of the 2026 notes to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries unrealized translation adjustments from a portion of the 2026 notes were included in the foreign currency translation component of aoci which offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries the cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold as of january 3 2021 the total notional amount of the 2026 notes that was designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was €4972 million the unrealized foreign exchange losses gains recorded in aoci related to the net investment hedge were 496 million and 49 million during the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively 

during fiscal year 2018 we designated the 2021 notes to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries unrealized translation adjustments from the 2021 notes were included in the foreign currency translation component of aoci which offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries the cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 we removed the hedging relationship of the first €1000 million of the 2021 notes and investments in certain foreign subsidiaries during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 we removed the hedging relationship of the remaining €2000 million of the 2021 notes and investments in certain foreign subsidiaries the unrealized foreign exchange losses gains recorded in aoci related to the net investment hedge were 18 million and 80 million during the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively 

during fiscal year 2019 we entered into a crosscurrency swap designated as a net investment hedge to hedge the euro currency exposure of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries this agreement is a contract to exchange fixedrate payments in one currency for fixedrate payments in another currency changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded in equity as a component of aoci in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments in assessing the effectiveness of this hedge we use a method based on changes in spot rates to measure the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on both our foreign subsidiary net investment and the related swap under this method changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument other than those due to changes in the spot rate are initially recorded in aoci as a translation adjustment and then are amortized into other income expense net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations using a systematic and rational method over the instrument’s term changes in the fair value associated with the effective portion ie those changes due to the spot rate are recorded in aoci as a translation adjustment and are released and recognized in earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the hedged net investment the crosscurrency swap has an initial notional value of €1974 million or 2200 million and matures on november 15 2021 interest on the crosscurrency swap is payable semiannually in euro on may 15th and november 15th of each year based on the euro notional value and a fixed rate of 247 we receive interest in us dollars on may 15th and november 15th of each year based on the us dollar equivalent of the euro notional value and a fixed rate of 500 as of january 3 2021 the fair value of the crosscurrency swap was 183 million which was recorded in aoci the unrealized foreign exchange losses gains recorded in aoci related to crosscurrency swap were 186 million and 03 million dur ing the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively 

during the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2020 we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the 2021 notes the effective portion of the gain or loss of the cash flow hedges will be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings as of january 3 2021 the total notional amount of the forward foreign exchange contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges was €3000 million the unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in earnings related to the cash flow hedges were 293 million during the fiscal year 2020 

we do not expect any material net pretax gains or losses to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss income into interest and other expense net within the next twelve months 

market risk 

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 70 of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in natural hedges 

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be positively but not proportionately impacted conversely when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be negatively but not proportionately impacted 

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days as of january 3 2021 this computation estimated that there is a 5 chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 05 million this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2020 the valueatrisk ranged between 02 million and 05 million with an average of approximately 04 million 

interest rate risk as of january 3 2021 we had 1586 million in outstanding borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility as described above in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” amounts drawn under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

bear interest at variable rates our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 4020 million at january 3 2021 fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

interest rate risk—sensitivity  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

i changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows to fluctuate an increase of 10 or approximately 10 basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 02 million for fiscal year 2021 

ii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

marketing 

all of our businesses market their products and services primarily through their own specialized sales forces as of december 29 2019  we employed approximately 5300 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 38 countries and marketing products and services in more than 190 countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials key components and supplies 

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with our suppliers for certain critical raw materials key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components see the applicable risk factor in “item 1a risk factors” for an additional description of this risk 

  

intellectual property 

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties 

  

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required for a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

due to the range and diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors our competitors range from foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to more narrowly focused firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation operational efficiency product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market positions we expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing uses emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 77 million and 79 million as of december 29 2019 and december 30 2018  respectively which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

as of december 29 2019  we employed approximately 13000 employees several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of december 29 2019  we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately 1500 union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding restrictions in capital expenditures general economic conditions cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

our growth is subject to global economic and political conditions and operational disruptions at our facilities 

our business is affected by global economic and political conditions as well as the state of the financial markets particularly as the united states and other countries balance concerns around debt inflation growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives there can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows results of operations financial position or our ability to access capital such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the united states and internationally our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location 

while we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities a major earthquake fire flood power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments or other measures and some of these risks are insurable but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 



 many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or divestitures license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our recent acquisition of cisbio bioassays however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons such as 

 some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition if for example we are unable to successfully commercialize products and services related to significant inprocess research and development that we have capitalized we may have to impair the value of such assets accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences loss of key personnel unforeseen regulatory requirements previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results additionally if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies which may adversely impact our profitability 

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies the expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders 

that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market or incur losses for failing to comply with our contractual obligations in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed in the short term due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs as a result small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 



 a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the united states postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals tantalum tin gold tungsten and their derivatives that may be contained in our products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as a result of these rules we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the components used in our products be certified as conflictfree and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs 

the manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product and other liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product and other liability claims if our products services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies in the united states and abroad we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil criminal or monetary penalties 

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions some of our products are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

we are also subject to a variety of laws regulations and standards that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances and our business practices in the united states and abroad such as antibribery anticorruption and competition laws this requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws regulations and standards a failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

outbreaks of communicable diseases in various parts of china and other countries may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks related to health epidemics or outbreaks of communicable diseases beginning in late 2019 china as well as several other countries experienced an outbreak of a highly contagious form of an upper respiratory infection caused by covid19 a novel coronavirus strain commonly referred to as coronavirus the outbreak has severely restricted the level of economic activity in affected areas and may have an adverse impact on sales of certain of our products and services andor our suppliers especially in china approximately 20 of our net sales from continuing operations in fiscal year 2019 came from china the extent to which coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot currently be predicted including the severity of the outbreak and the responsive actions taken to contain it or treat its impact 

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2019  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 



 if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and scientists and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or those of our customers suppliers or other third parties or cybercrime resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or assets or if we fail to implement new systems software and technologies successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to develop manufacture and provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers suppliers or other third parties it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems or cybercrime resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or assets could result in losses or misappropriation of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

we have a substantial amount of outstanding debt which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business 

  

we have a substantial amount of debt and other financial obligations our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 



 in addition we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility senior unsecured notes due in april 2021 april 2021 notes senior unsecured notes due in 2026 2026 notes and senior unsecured notes due in 2029 2029 notes include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company these include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

 we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments 

any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility the april 2021 notes the 2026 notes the 2029 notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances 

discontinuation reform or replacement of libor may adversely affect our variable rate debt 

our indebtedness under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility bears interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us dollars in july 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee in the united states has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to us dollar libor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to libor if libor is discontinued reformed or replaced we expect that our indebtedness under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility will be indexed to a replacement benchmark based on sofr any such change could cause the effective interest rate under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall interest expense to increase in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union could adversely impact our results of operations 

nearly 3 of our net sales from continuing operations in fiscal year 2019 came from the united kingdom following the referendum vote in the united kingdom in june 2016 in favor of leaving the european union on january 31 2020 the country formally withdrew from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” brexit has involved a process of lengthy negotiations between the united kingdom and european union member states to determine the future terms of the united kingdom’s relationship with the european union these negotiations remain ongoing and the potential effects of brexit are uncertain brexit has caused and may continue to create volatility in global stock markets and regional and global economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom financial and banking markets weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm our business and if such conditions worsen in the united kingdom or in the rest of europe it may have a material adverse effect on our operations and sales 

any significant weakening of the great britain pound to the us dollar will have an adverse impact on our european revenues due to the importance of our sales in the united kingdom currency exchange rates in the pound sterling and the euro with respect to each other and the us dollar have already been adversely affected by brexit and that may continue to be the case in addition if the united kingdom is unable to negotiate trade agreements with terms as beneficial to the united kingdom as those previously in place under global trade agreements negotiated by the european union on behalf of its members the united kingdom could face increased trade barriers which could make our doing business in united kingdom more difficult 

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

as of december 29 2019  our total assets included 44 billion of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights customer relationships core technology and technology licenses and inprocess research and development net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets 

adverse changes in our business adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units or the failure to grow our discovery  analytical solutions and diagnostics segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our share price will fluctuate 

over the last several years stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 

 dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

on october 24 2019  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 that was paid in february 2020  on january 23 2020  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 that will be payable in may 2020  in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

overview of fiscal year 2019 

during fiscal year 2019  we continued to see strong returns from our acquisitions as well as our organic investments across technology marketing and people our overall revenue in fiscal year 2019 increase d 1057 million  or 4  as compared to fiscal year 2018  reflecting an increase of 530 million  or 3  in our discovery  analytical solutions segment revenue and an increase of 527 million  or 5  in our diagnostics segment revenue the increase in our discovery  analytical solutions segment during fiscal year 2019 was due to an increase of 425 million from our life sciences market revenue and 104 million from our applied markets revenue the increase in our diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an increase of 372 million from our immunodiagnostics revenue and 224 million from our reproductive health revenue partially offset by a decrease of 69 million from our applied genomics revenue 

in our discovery  analytical solutions segment we experienced growth during fiscal year 2019 driven by successful new product introductions and the performance of our acquisitions we saw continued growth in our food portfolio mostly driven by cannabis demand while in the life sciences market we experienced strength in our drug discovery offering and strong performance in our informatics business 

in our diagnostics segment we experienced growth from reproductive health genetic testing and immunodiagnostics solutions across all regions we saw strong growth in immunodiagnostics driven by euroimmun which was broadbased from both a geographic and product basis as well as continued growth in our tulip and symbio franchises partially offset by a decline in the performance of applied genomics during fiscal year 2019 in our reproductive health business expanded coverage in asia helped to offset the effect of decreased birthrates during fiscal year 2019 we expanded the extent and the reach of our capabilities to enable earlier treatments and better outcomes both in terms of diseases and geographies 

our consolidated gross margins increase d 14 basis points in fiscal year 2019  as compared to fiscal year 2018  primarily due to favorable shift in product mix and continued productivity initiatives to improve our supply chain our consolidated operating margin increase d 89 basis points in fiscal year 2019  as compared to fiscal year 2018 primarily due to favorable shift in product mix and lower costs as a result of our cost containment and productivity initiatives partially offset by increased amortization of intangible assets and acquired inventory revaluation 

we continue to believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the spending trends in our end markets and to promote efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services overall we believe that our strategic focus on diagnostics and discovery and analytical solutions markets coupled with our deep portfolio of technologies and applications leading market positions global scale and financial strength will provide us with a foundation for growth

2 decrease in revenue attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions and divestitures the total increase in revenue reflects an increase in our diagnostics segment revenue of 527 million  or 5  due to growth in our reproductive health and immunodiagnostics businesses partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates our discovery  analytical solutions segment revenue increase d by 530 million  or 3  due to an increase of 425 million from our life sciences market revenue and an increase of 104 million from our applied markets revenue partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules we did not recognize 08 million of revenue primarily related to our diagnostics segment for each of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods 

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue for fiscal year 2019 was 14876 million  as compared to 14371 million for fiscal year 2018  an increase of approximately 506 million  or 4  as a percentage of revenue cost of revenue decrease d to 516 in fiscal year 2019 from 517 in fiscal year 2018  resulting in an increase in gross margin of approximately 14 basis points to 484 in fiscal year 2019 from 483 in fiscal year 2018  amortization of intangible assets increase d and was 614 million for fiscal year 2019  as compared to 462 million for fiscal year 2018  stockbased compensation expense was 16 million for fiscal year 2019  as compared to 15 million for fiscal year 2018  the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an incremental expense of 216 million for fiscal year 2019  as compared to 193 million for fiscal year 2018  acquisition and divestiturerelated expenses contingent consideration and other costs were minimal for fiscal year 2019  as compared to an incremental expense of 01 million for fiscal year 2018  in addition to the factors noted above the overall increase in gross margin primarily the result of mix price and improved manufacturing and services productivity

restructuring and other costs net 

we have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures the alignment of our operations with our growth strategy the integration of our business units and productivity initiatives restructuring and other costs net for fiscal year 2019 were 294 million as compared to 111 million for fiscal year 2018  

we implemented a restructuring plan in each quarter of fiscal year 2019 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives the q1 2019 plan q2 2019 plan q3 2019 plan and q4 2019 plan respectively we implemented a restructuring plan in each of the first third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2018 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives the q1 2018 plan q3 2018 plan and q4 2018 plan respectively all other previous restructuring plans were workforce reductions or the closure of excess facility space principally intended to integrate our businesses in order to realign operations reduce costs achieve operational efficiencies and shift resources into geographic regions and end markets that are more consistent with our growth strategy the previous plans 

the following table summarizes the number of employees reduced the initial restructuring or contract termination charges by operating segment and the dates by which payments were substantially completed or the expected dates by which payments will be substantially completed for restructuring actions implemented during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 in continuing operations 



we expect to make payments under the previous plans for remaining residual lease obligations with terms varying in length through fiscal year 2022  

we also have terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges to the extent applicable for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us we recorded additional pretax charges of 02 million and 50 million in the discovery  analytical solutions segment during fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively and 02 million during fiscal year 2019 in the diagnostics segment as a result of these contract terminations 

we recorded pretax charges of 08 million associated with relocating facilities during fiscal year 2019 we expect to make payments on these relocation activities through fiscal year 2021 

at december 29 2019  we had 139 million recorded for accrued restructuring and other charges of which 116 million was recorded in shortterm accrued restructuring and other charges 04 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 08 million was recorded in longterm liabilities and 11 million was recorded in operating lease liabilities at december 30 2018  we had 62 million recorded for accrued restructuring and other charges of which 48 million was recorded in shortterm accrued restructuring and other charges and 14 million was recorded in longterm liabilities the following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan as well as other accrual balances and related activity during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 in continuing operations 



 

 

interest and other expense net 

interest and other expense net consisted of the following 



interest and other expense net for fiscal year 2019 was an expense of 1248 million  as compared to an expense of 662 million for fiscal year 2018  an increase of 586 million  the increase in interest and other expense net in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was largely due to an increase in debt extinguishment costs of 325 million primarily associated with the redemption of the november 2021 notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019  a loss on disposition of businesses and assets net of 25 million in fiscal year 2019 as compared to a gain on disposition of businesses and assets net of 128 million in fiscal year 2018  and an increase in other expense net of 145 million primarily due to an increase in pensionrelated expenses of 138 million  an increase of 32 million in expenses related to acquisitionrelated foreign currency transactions and translation of nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities partially offset by 32 million of change in fair value of financial securities this was partially offset by a decrease of 33 million in interest expense in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 associated with the crosscurrency swap that we entered into during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 to swap higher cost us denominated debt with lower cost eurodenominated debt and an increase in interest income of 04 million in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018  a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates on continuing operations were 40 and 78 for fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively certain of our subsidiaries have at various times been granted tax relief in their respective countries resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates a reconciliation of income tax expense at the us federal statutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended 



  

the variation in our effective tax rate for each year is primarily a result of the recognition of earnings in foreign jurisdictions predominantly singapore finland and the netherlands which are taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate resulting in a benefit from income taxes of 167 million in fiscal year 2019 and 187 million in fiscal year 2018  these amounts include 104 million in fiscal year 2019 and 103 million in fiscal year 2018 of benefits derived from tax holidays in china and singapore the effect of these benefits derived from tax holidays on basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2019 was 009 and 009  respectively and for fiscal year 2018 was 009 and 009  respectively the tax holiday in china is renewed every three years we expect to renew the tax holiday of one of our subsidiaries in china that expired in fiscal year 2019  the tax holiday in one of our subsidiaries in singapore is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2023  

disposition of businesses and assets 

as part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have discontinued certain businesses when the discontinued operations represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations any business deemed to be a discontinued operation prior to the adoption of accounting standards update 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity continues to be reported as a discontinued operation and the results of operations and related cash flows are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented any remaining assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 29 2019 and december 30 2018  

we recorded the following pretax gains and losses which have been reported as a net gain or loss on disposition of discontinued operations during the two fiscal years included below 



during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities related to our multispectral imaging business for aggregate consideration of 373 million  recognizing a pretax gain of 130 million  the pretax gain is included in interest and other expense net in the consolidated statement of operations the multispectral imaging business was a component of our discovery  analytical solutions segment the divestiture of the multispectral imaging business has not been classified as a discontinued operation in this form 10k because the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements 

we recorded a provision for benefit from income taxes of 02 million and 13 million on discontinued operations and dispositions in fiscal years 2019 and 2018  

fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017

business combinations 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2019 

during the fiscal year 2019 we completed the acquisition of five businesses for aggregate consideration of 4331 million in cash the acquired businesses include cisbio bioassays sas “cisbio” a company based in codolet france which was acquired for a total consideration of 2199 million in cash shandong meizheng biotech co ltd meizheng group a company headquartered in beijing china for a total consideration of 1665 million in cash and three other businesses were acquired for a total consideration of 466 million in cash we have a potential obligation to pay the former shareholders of certain of these acquired businesses additional contingent consideration of up to 318 million  the excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforces acquired and has been allocated to goodwill which is not tax deductible we have reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our diagnostics and discovery  analytical solutions segments as applicable from the acquisition dates identifiable definitelived intangible assets such as core technology trade names and customer relationships acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of 110 years  

acquisitions in fiscal year 2018 

during fiscal year 2018 we completed the acquisition of four businesses for aggregate consideration of 1058 million  the excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforces acquired and has been allocated to goodwill which is not tax deductible we have reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our diagnostics and discovery  analytical solutions segments as applicable from the acquisition dates identifiable definitelived intangible assets such as core technology trade names and customer relationships acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of 112 years  

acquisitions in fiscal year 2017 

for a discussion of our acquisitions for fiscal year 2017 see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 30 2018 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 26 2019 

as of december 29 2019  the allocations of purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were final the preliminary allocations of the purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2019 were based upon initial valuations our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete our valuations within the measurement periods which are up to one year from the respective acquisition dates the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances and residual goodwill we expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition dates during the measurement periods during the measurement periods we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of those dates these adjustments will be made in the periods in which the amounts are determined and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition dates all changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement periods are also included in current period earnings 

during fiscal year 2019  we obtained information relevant to determining the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to recent acquisitions and adjusted our purchase price allocations based on this information we recognized an increase in goodwill of 61 million  an increase in deferred tax liabilities of 51 million  a decrease in current assets of 16 million  a decrease in liabilities assumed of 04 million and a decrease in other assets of 01 million  

allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period 

as of december 29 2019  we may have to pay contingent consideration related to acquisitions with open contingency periods of up to 571 million  as of december 29 2019  we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 355 million  of which 208 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 147 million was recorded in longterm liabilities as of december 30 2018  we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 697 million  of which 670 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 27 million was recorded in longterm liabilities the expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed 30 years from december 29 2019  and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at december 29 2019 was 12 years  if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of definitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional contingent consideration which would be recognized as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations 

in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin thereon the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services we do not include any costs associated with selling effort research and development or the related margins on these costs in most acquisitions profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition the sum of the costs and operating income approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a thirdparty to assume the obligation 

contingencies including tax matters 

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we 

accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 77 million and 79 million as of december 29 2019 and december 30 2018  respectively in accrued expenses and other current liabilities which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

various tax years after 2010 remain open to examination by certain jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such as finland germany italy netherlands singapore china and the united states the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 

we are subject to various claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in our opinion based on our review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these contingencies at december 29 2019 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

financing lease obligations in fiscal year 2012 we entered into agreements with the lessors of certain buildings that we are currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings we provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings and as a result we were considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period at the end of the construction period we were not reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs we are therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases qualify as financing leases under saleleaseback accounting guidance representing debt obligations for us and noncash investing and financing activities as a result we capitalized 293 million in property plant and equipment net representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt we have also capitalized 115 million in additional construction costs necessary to complete the renovations to the buildings which were funded by the lessors with a corresponding increase to debt at december 30 2018  we had 345 million recorded for these financing lease obligations of which 15 million was recorded as shortterm debt and 330 million was recorded as longterm debt prior to adoption of asc 842 leases asc 842 the buildings were depreciated on a straightline basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values which will equal the remaining financing obligation at the end of the lease term at the end of the lease term the remaining balances in property plant and equipment net and debt will be reversed against each other upon adoption of asc 842 in fiscal year 2019 we derecognized the impact of this buildtosuit arrangement

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 29 2019 for continuing and discontinued operations purchase commitments are minimal and have been excluded from this table 

  

 



   

as of december 29 2019  we may have to pay the former shareholders of certain of our acquisitions contingent consideration of up to 571 million  the table above does not reflect any of these obligations as the timing and amounts are uncertain for further information related to our contingent consideration obligations see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

capital expenditures 

during fiscal year 2020  we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2019  primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

at december 29 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents of 1919 million  of which 1729 million was held by our nonus subsidiaries and we had 6632 million of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility we had no other liquid investments at december 29 2019  

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act requires us to pay a onetime transition tax on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries based on available information we estimated the tax on the deemed repatriation of our foreign earnings and recorded a tax expense of 850 million in continuing operations at december 31 2017 during the fiscal years 2019 and 2018  we refined our calculations of the onetime transition tax based on newly issued guidance from the internal revenue service and recorded a tax expense benefit of 27 million and 46 million  respectively in continuing operations related to the onetime transition tax in addition during fiscal year 2018 we determined that previously undistributed earnings of certain international subsidiaries no longer met the requirements of indefinite reinvestment and therefore recognized 29 million of income tax expense during the year our intent is to continue to reinvest the remaining undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries indefinitely no additional income tax expense has been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

on july 23 2018 our board of directors the board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to 2500 million under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program the repurchase program will expire on july 23 2020 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2019  we had no stock repurchases under the repurchase program as of december 29 2019  1978 million remained available for aggregate repurchases of shares under the repurchase program 

  in addition our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans during the fiscal year 2019  we repurchased 68536 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 63 million  during fiscal year 2018  we repurchased 66506 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 52 million  

the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability creating increased volatility in security prices widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets with respect to plans outside of the united states we expect to contribute 66 million in the aggregate during fiscal year 2020 during fiscal years 2019 and 2018  we contributed 82 million and 85 million  in the aggregate to pension plans outside of the united states respectively during fiscal year 2018 we contributed 150 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states for the plan year 2017 we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans 

effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 nature of operations and accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition warranty costs bad debts inventories accounting for business combinations and dispositions longlived assets pensions and other postretirement benefits restructuring income taxes contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations we recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the promised products or services when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of those products or services to customers 

taxes that are collected by us from a customer and assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenueproducing transaction are excluded from revenue 

the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings accounts are writtenoff only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted 

  

inventory valuation we value inventory at the lower of cost or market inventories are accounted for using the firstin firstout method we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its 

recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest inprocess research and development “iprd” is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period 

value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment operating lease right of use assets investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using a measurement date of january 1 2019  and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment at january 1 2019  the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 200 for each reporting unit except for our tulip and euroimmun reporting units the range of the longterm terminal growth rates for the reporting units was 30 to 50 for the fiscal year 2019 impairment analysis the range for the discount rates for the reporting units was 105 to 145  keeping all other variables constant a 100 change in any one of these input assumptions for the various reporting units except for our tulip and euroimmun reporting units would still allow us to conclude that there was no impairment of goodwill the fair values of our tulip and euroimmun reporting units approximated their respective carrying values given that these reporting units were relatively new acquisitions 

we consistently employed the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce tax rates capital spending discount rates and working capital changes cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years’ cash flows and historical relationships in later years the income approach is sensitive to changes in longterm terminal growth rates and the discount rates the longterm terminal growth rates are consistent with our historical longterm terminal growth rates as the current economic trends are not expected to affect our longterm terminal growth rates we corroborate the income approach with a market approach while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future 

nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test we consistently employed the relief from royalty model to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of nonamortizing intangible asset the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the nonamortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a nonamortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of the amortizing intangible asset in addition we evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible asset at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of our nonamortizing intangible asset is no longer indefinite the asset will be tested for impairment this intangible asset will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 

we performed our annual impairment testing as of january 1 2019  and concluded that there was no impairment of nonamortizing intangible asset an assessment of the recoverability of amortizing intangible assets takes place when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment no such events occurred during fiscal year 2019  

employee compensation and benefits we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar monthend that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement 

we recognized a loss of 261 million and 119 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans which includes the charge or benefit for the marktomarket adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans which was recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the loss or income related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans was a pretax loss of 312 million in fiscal year 2019 and a pretax loss of 214 million in fiscal year 2018  we expect income of approximately 23 million in fiscal year 2020 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans excluding the charge for or benefit from the marktomarket adjustment it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a marktomarket adjustment in fiscal year 2020  marktomarket adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control including changes in interest rates the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease markto market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2020  conversely to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected markto market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2020  pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year beginning in fiscal year 2016 the approach we use to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for certain nonus benefit plans was changed to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs prior to fiscal year 2016 we calculated these service and interest components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in fiscal year 2016 we have elected to utilize an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period 

as of december 29 2019  we estimate the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 725 and to be 220 for all plans outside the united states in addition as of december 29 2019  we estimate the discount rate for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 301 and to be 207 for all plans outside the united states during fiscal year 2018 the society of actuaries issued an updated projection scale mp2018 which incorporated an additional year 2016 of us population data and reduced the life expectancy used to determine the projected benefit obligation we adopted mp2018 as of december 30 2018 the adoption of mp2018 resulted in a 10 million decrease to the projected benefit obligation at december 30 2018 during fiscal year 2019 the society of actuaries issued an updated projection scale mp2019 which incorporated an additional year 2017 of us population data and reduced the life expectancy used to determine the projected benefit obligation we adopted mp2019 as of december 30 2019 the adoption of mp2019 resulted in a 44 million decrease to the projected benefit obligation at december 29 2019 we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for 

each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date 

if any of our assumptions were to change as of december 29 2019  our pension plan expenses would also change 



we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and contractual agreements ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income iii costs to relocate facilities and iv impairment of assets as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled “restructuring and other costs net” 

dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation which meets the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated any such changes decrease or increase current earnings during the fiscal year ended december 29 2019  we had no disposition of discontinued operations 

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine our current tax provision as well as enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled to determine our deferred tax provision any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

the tax act made broad and complex changes to the us internal revenue code which included reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the end of the measurement period for purposes of staff 

accounting bulletin no 118 was december 22 2018 we have completed the analysis based on legislative updates relating to the tax act currently available and have recorded the impact in tax expense from continuing operations 

we will be subject to the new global intangible low tax income gilti tax rules that are part of the modified territorial tax system imposed by the tax act under us gaap we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes the “deferred method” we decided to adopt the period cost method and thus have not recorded any potential deferred tax effects related to gilti and fdii in our financial statements for the fiscal year ended december 29 2019 

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

additionally we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards state income tax credit carryforwards and certain foreign tax attributes valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision 

historically deferred income tax expense has not been provided on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries in fiscal year 2018 we determined that previously undistributed earnings of certain international subsidiaries of approximately 14 billion no longer met the requirements of indefinite reinvestment we recognized 29 million of income tax expense in fiscal year 2018 associated with the change in our assertion in addition during fiscal years 2019 and 2018  we refined our calculations of the onetime transition tax and recorded a tax expense benefit of 27 million and 46 million  respectively our intent is to continue to reinvest the remaining undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries indefinitely while federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the tax act we have not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes state income tax or foreign exchange gain or loss as of december 29 2019  the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the us indefinitely and for which no additional incremental us tax cost has been provided other than the 860 million from the onetime transition tax on deemed repatriation was approximately 4492 million  it is not practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to such incremental tax costs on those earnings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments derivatives marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december 29 2019  

  we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments by nature all financial instruments involve market and credit risks we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments approximately 70 of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in 

foreign currencies as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can increase the costs of financing investing and operating the business 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months  have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows 

principal hedged currencies include the chinese yuan euro british pound swedish krona and singapore dollar we held forward foreign exchange contracts designated as economic hedges with us dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling 2776 million at december 29 2019  2233 million at december 30 2018  and 2121 million at december 31 2017  and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material the duration of these contracts was generally 30 days or less during each of fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017  

in addition in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance its acquisitions and stock repurchase program we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies we record these hedges at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on these hedges as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges which were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements included combined euro notional amounts of €1058 million and combined us dollar notional amounts of 56 million as of december 29 2019  combined euro notional amounts of €373 million and combined us dollar notional amounts of 57 million as of december 30 2018  and combined euro notional amounts of €572 million and combined us dollar notional amounts of 13 billion as of december 31 2017  the net gains and losses on these derivatives combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material for each of the fiscal years 2019 and 2018  we paid 13 million and 341 million during the fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively from the settlement of these hedges 

during fiscal year 2018 we designated a portion of the 2026 notes to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries unrealized translation adjustments from a portion of the 2026 notes were included in the foreign currency translation component of aoci which offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries the cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold as of december 29 2019  the total notional amount of the 2026 notes that was designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was €2033 million  the unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in aoci related to the net investment hedge were 49 million and 93 million during the fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively 

during fiscal year 2018 we designated the april 2021 notes to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries unrealized translation adjustments from the april 2021 notes were included in the foreign currency translation component of aoci which offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries the cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold as of december 29 2019  the total notional amount of the april 2021 notes that was designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was €2999 million  the unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in aoci related to the net investment hedge were 80 million and 275 million during the fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively 

during fiscal year 2019 we entered into a crosscurrency swap designated as a net investment hedge to hedge the euro currency exposure of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries this agreement is a contract to exchange fixedrate payments in one currency for fixedrate payments in another currency changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded in equity as a component of aoci in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments in assessing the effectiveness of this hedge we use a method based on changes in spot rates to measure the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on both our foreign subsidiary net investment and the related swap under this method changes in the fair value of 

the hedging instrument other than those due to changes in the spot rate are initially recorded in aoci as a translation adjustment and then are amortized into other income expense net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations using a systematic and rational method over the instrument’s term changes in the fair value associated with the effective portion ie those changes due to the spot rate are recorded in aoci as a translation adjustment and are released and recognized in earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the hedged net investment the crosscurrency swap has an initial notional value of €1974 million or 2200 million and matures on november 15 2021 interest on the crosscurrency swap is payable semiannually in euro on may 15th and november 15th of each year based on the euro notional value and a fixed rate of 247  we receive interest in us dollars on may 15th and november 15th of each year based on the us dollar equivalent of the euro notional value and a fixed rate of 500  on december 29 2019  the fair value of the crosscurrency swap was 03 million  which was recorded in aoci 

in connection with the early redemption of the november 2021 notes on september 11 2019 we entered into a reverse treasury rate lock agreement with a financial intermediary with a notional amount of 5000 million  we entered into the reverse treasury rate lock agreement in order to hedge the variability in the redemption payment on the entire principal amount of the november 2021 notes the reverse treasury rate lock substantively fixed the present value of the forecasted debt makewhole payment which was priced on october 10 2019 to mitigate risk associated with the changes in the 2year us treasury yield we received 10 million upon settlement of the reverse treasury rate lock 

market risk 

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 70 of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in natural hedges 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be positively but not proportionately impacted conversely when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be negatively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days as of december 29 2019  this computation estimated that there is a 5 chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 01 million  this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2019  the valueatrisk ranged between 01 million and 05 million  with an average of approximately 03 million  

  

interest rate risk as of december 29 2019  we had 3254 million in outstanding borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility as described above in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” amounts drawn under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 1919 million at december 29 2019  fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

interest rate risk—sensitivity  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  i changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows to fluctuate an increase of 10  or approximately 27 basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 09 million for fiscal year 2020  

  

ii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 29 2019  the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 29 2019  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 29 2019  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

recent developments 

as part of our strategy to grow our core businesses we have recently taken the following actions 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2018 

we completed the acquisition of four businesses for aggregate consideration of 1060 million  we reported the operations of these acquisitions within the results of our discovery  analytical solutions or diagnostics segments as applicable from the acquisition dates 

restructuring 

during fiscal year 2018  we recorded pretax restructuring charges of 66 million  in our discovery  analytical solutions segment and 15 million  in our diagnostics segment related to a workforce reduction from restructuring activities our management approved these plans to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives we also terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges to the extent applicable for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us we recorded pretax charges of 50 million  in the discovery  analytical solutions segment during fiscal year 2018  as a result of these contract terminations 

this pretax restructuring activity has been reported as restructuring and contract termination charges and is included as a component of income from continuing operations we expect no significant impact on future operating results or cash flows from the restructuring activities executed in fiscal year 2018

marketing 

all of our businesses market their products and services primarily through their own specialized sales forces as of december 30 2018  we employed approximately 4800  sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35  countries and marketing products and services in more than 180  countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials key components and supplies 

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with our suppliers for certain critical raw materials key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components see the applicable risk factor in “item 1a risk factors” for an additional description of this risk 

  

intellectual property 

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the 

competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties 

  

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required for a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

due to the range and diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors our competitors range from foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to more narrowly focused firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation operational efficiency product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market positions we expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

research and development 

we have a broad product base and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs to accelerate our growth initiatives we directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016  primarily toward our diagnostics segment and the life sciences and applied markets within our discovery  analytical solutions segment we expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2019  and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics segment and the life sciences and applied markets within our discovery  analytical solutions segment 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing uses emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 79 million  and 94 million  as of december 30 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named 

parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

as of december 30 2018  we employed approximately 12500  employees several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of december 30 2018  we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately 1700  union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding restrictions in capital expenditures general economic conditions cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

our growth is subject to global economic and political conditions and operational disruptions at our facilities 

our business is affected by global economic and political conditions as well as the state of the financial markets particularly as the united states and other countries balance concerns around debt inflation growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives there can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows results of operations financial position or our ability to access capital such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the united states and internationally our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location 

while we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities a major earthquake fire flood power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments or other measures and some of these risks are insurable but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

 many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or divestitures license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our various acquisitions during fiscal year 2018 however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons such as 

 some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition if for example we are unable to successfully commercialize products and services related to significant inprocess research and development that we have capitalized we may have to impair the value of such assets accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences loss of key personnel unforeseen regulatory requirements previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results additionally if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses related to 

completing acquisitions or licensing technologies or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies which may adversely impact our profitability 

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies the expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market or incur losses for failing to comply with our contractual obligations in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed in the short term due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs as a result small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 



 a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the united states postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals tantalum tin gold tungsten and their derivatives that may be contained in our products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as a result of these rules we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the components used in our products be certified as conflictfree and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs 

the manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product and other liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product and other liability claims if our products services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies in the united states and abroad we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil criminal or monetary penalties 

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions some of our products are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

we are also subject to a variety of laws regulations and standards that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances and our business practices in the united states and abroad such as antibribery anticorruption and competition laws this requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws regulations and standards a failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2018  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 



 if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and scientists and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or those of our customers suppliers or other third parties or cybercrime resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or assets or if we fail to implement new systems software and technologies successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to develop manufacture and provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers suppliers or other third parties it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems or cybercrime resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or assets could result in losses or misappropriation of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

we have a substantial amount of outstanding debt which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business 

  

we have a substantial amount of debt and other financial obligations our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 in addition we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility senior unsecured notes due in april 2021 april 2021 notes senior unsecured notes due in november 2021 november 2021 notes and senior unsecured notes due in 2026 2026 notes include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company these include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

 we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments 

any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility the april 2021 notes the november 2021 notes the 2026 notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances 

the united kingdoms vote in favor of withdrawing from the european union could adversely impact our results of operations 

nearly 3 of our net sales from continuing operations in fiscal year 2018  came from the united kingdom following the referendum vote in the united kingdom in june 2016 in favor of leaving the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” on march 29 2017 the country formally notified the european union of its intention to withdraw brexit has involved a process of lengthy negotiations between the united kingdom and european union member states to determine the future terms of the united kingdom’s relationship with the european union the potential effects of brexit remain uncertain brexit has caused and may continue to create volatility in global stock markets and regional and global economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom financial and banking markets weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm our business and if such conditions worsen in the united kingdom or in the rest of europe it may have a material adverse effect on our operations and sales 

any significant weakening of the great britain pound to the us dollar will have an adverse impact on our european revenues due to the importance of our sales in the united kingdom currency exchange rates in the pound sterling and the euro with respect to each other and the us dollar have already been adversely affected by brexit and that may continue to be the case in addition depending on the terms of brexit the united kingdom could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the european union on behalf of its members which may result in increased trade barriers which could make our doing business in europe more difficult 

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

as of december 30 2018  our total assets included 42 billion  of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights customer relationships core technology and technology licenses and inprocess research and development net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets 

adverse changes in our business adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units or the failure to grow our discovery  analytical solutions and diagnostics segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our share price will fluctuate 

over the last several years stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 

 dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

on october 24 2018  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2018  that was paid in february 2019  on january 24 2019  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the first  quarter of fiscal year 2019  that will be payable in may 2019  in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

overview of fiscal year 2018   

during fiscal year 2018  we continued to see good performance from acquisitions investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives our overall revenue in fiscal year 2018   increase d 5210 million  or 23  as compared to fiscal year 2017  reflecting an increase  of 1148 million  or 7  in our discovery  analytical solutions segment revenue and an increase  of 4063 million  or 60  in our diagnostics segment revenue the increase  in our discovery  analytical solutions segment during fiscal year 2018  was due to an increase  of 735 million  from our applied markets revenue and an increase  of 413 million  from our life sciences market revenue the increase  in our diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2018  was primarily due to our acquisition of euroimmun which contributed 3594 million  in revenue during fiscal year 2018 as well as continued expansion in our reproductive health genetic testing applied genomics and immunodiagnostics solutions 

in our discovery  analytical solutions segment we experienced growth during fiscal year 2018  driven by successful new product introductions and an improving macroenvironment we also experienced strong demand for industrial environmental and food offerings in the life sciences market we experienced strength in our drug discovery sales and strong performance in our informatics business 

in our diagnostics segment we experienced growth from our acquisition of euroimmun and continued expansion in our reproductive health genetic testing applied genomics and immunodiagnostics solutions particularly in the americas and emerging markets such as china and india we saw strong growth in newborn screening as an increased number of offerings helped to offset the effect of decreased birthrates during fiscal year 2018  we expanded both the extent and reach of our capabilities to enable earlier treatments and better outcomes both in terms of diseases and geographies the acquisition of euroimmun has increased our reagent mix expanded our technical capabilities and positioned us in more attractive markets 

our consolidated gross margins increase d 70  basis points in fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal year 2017  primarily due to favorable shift in product mix and continued productivity initiatives to improve our supply chain our consolidated operating margin decrease d 144  basis points in fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal year 2017  primarily due to increased amortization of intangible assets and acquired inventory revaluation increased costs related to investments in new product development partially offset by lower costs as a result of cost containment and productivity initiatives 

we continue to believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the spending trends in our end markets and to promote efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services overall we believe that our strategic focus on diagnostics and discovery and analytical solutions markets coupled with our deep portfolio of technologies and applications leading market positions global scale and financial strength will provide us with a foundation for growth

restructuring and contract termination charges net 

we have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures the alignment of our operations with our growth strategy the integration of our business units and productivity initiatives restructuring and contract termination charges for fiscal year 2018  were 111 million  as compared to 127 million  for fiscal year 2017  and 51 million  for fiscal year 2016  

we implemented a restructuring plan in each of the first third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2018 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives the q1 2018 plan q3 2018 plan and q4 2018 plan respectively we implemented a restructuring plan in each of the fourth and third quarters of fiscal year 2017 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives the q4 2017 plan and q3 2017 plan respectively we implemented a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 consisting of workforce reductions and the closure of excess facility space principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets the q1 2017 plan we implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to focus resources on higher growth product lines the q3 2016 plan we implemented a restructuring plan in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets the q2 2016 plan all other previous restructuring plans were workforce reductions or the closure of excess facility space principally intended to integrate our businesses in order to realign 

operations reduce costs achieve operational efficiencies and shift resources into geographic regions and end markets that are more consistent with our growth strategy the previous plans 

the following table summarizes the number of employees reduced the initial restructuring or contract termination charges by operating segment and the dates by which payments were substantially completed or the expected dates by which payments will be substantially completed for restructuring actions implemented during fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016  in continuing operations 



we expect to make payments under the previous plans for remaining residual lease obligations with terms varying in length through fiscal year 2022  

we also have terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges to the extent applicable for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us we recorded additional pretax charges of 50 million  36 million  and 01 million  in the discovery  analytical solutions segment during fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016  respectively and 05 million  during fiscal year 2017  in the diagnostics segment as a result of these contract terminations 

at december 30 2018  we had 62 million  recorded for accrued restructuring and contract termination charges of which 48 million  was recorded in shortterm accrued restructuring and 14 million  was recorded in longterm liabilities at december 31 2017  we had 140 million  recorded for accrued restructuring and contract termination charges of which 88 million  was recorded in shortterm accrued restructuring 23 million  was recorded in longterm liabilities and 29 million  was recorded in other reserves the following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan as well as contract termination accrual balances and related activity during fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016  in continuing operations 



 

 

interest and other expense net 

interest and other expense net consisted of the following 



2018  compared to 2017  interest and other expense net for fiscal year 2018  was an expense  of 662 million  as compared to income  of 11 million  for fiscal year 2017  an increase  of 673 million  the increase  in interest and other expense net in fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal year 2017  was largely due to an increase in other expense net of 560 million  resulting from a onetime nonrecurring net foreign exchange gain of 365 million  in fiscal year 2017 related to remeasurement and settlement of euroimmun preacquisition hedges combined with an increase in pensionrelated expenses of 207 million  in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 interest expense increased by 230 million  in fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal year 2017  primarily due to a higher outstanding total debt balance beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017  related to financing for the euroimmun acquisition gain on disposition of businesses and assets net increased 132 million  in fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal year 2017  primarily due to sale of our multispectral imaging business in fiscal year 2018 interest income decreased 14 million  in fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal year 2017  due to the deployment of the cash proceeds realized from the sale of our medical imaging business in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017  that were initially invested and subsequently utilized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017  to support the settlement of the euroimmun acquisition a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

2017  compared to 2016  interest and other expense net for fiscal year 2017  was income  of 11 million  as compared to an expense  of 505 million  for fiscal year 2016  a decrease  of 516 million  the decrease  in interest and other expense net in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  was largely due to a decrease in other expense net by 580 million  which consists primarily of net foreign exchange gain of 365 million  in fiscal year 2017 related to remeasurement and settlement of the euroimmun preacquisition hedges combined with a decrease  in pensionrelated expenses of 207 million  in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  and an increase  in interest income of 19 million  in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  interest income increased primarily due to investing the proceeds from the sale of our medical imaging business in money market mutual funds this was partially offset by a net loss on disposition of businesses and assets net of 03 million  in fiscal year 2017 as compared to a net gain of 56 million  in fiscal year 2016  and an increase  in interest expense of 24 million  in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  due to the issuance of the 2026 notes the proceeds of which were deployed to paydown our lower cost debt outstanding on our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates on continuing operations were 78  471  and 116  for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016  respectively certain of our subsidiaries have at various times been granted tax relief in their respective countries resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates a reconciliation of income tax expense at the us federal statutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended 



  

the variation in our effective tax rate for each year is primarily a result of the recognition of earnings in foreign jurisdictions predominantly singapore finland and the netherlands which are taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate resulting in a benefit from income taxes of 187 million  in fiscal year 2018  559 million  in fiscal year 2017  and 482 million  in fiscal year 2016  these amounts include 103 million  in fiscal year 2018  101 million  in fiscal year 2017  and 114 million  in fiscal year 2016  of benefits derived from tax holidays in china and singapore the effect of these benefits derived from tax holidays on basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2018  was 009  and 009  respectively for fiscal year 2017  was 009  and 009  respectively and for fiscal year 2016  was 010  and 010  respectively the tax holiday in one of our subsidiaries in china expired in 2017 and the tax holiday in one other subsidiary in china is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2019  the tax holiday in one of our subsidiaries in singapore is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2023  

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law tax reform legislation known as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which makes broad and complex changes to the us internal revenue code changes include but are not limited to 1 the lowering of the us corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 2 the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial system with a onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 3 a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income gilti 4 the creation of the base erosion antiabuse tax beat which is effectively a new minimum tax 5 the deduction for foreignderived intangible income fdii 6 a new limitation on deductible interest expense 7 the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction and 8 limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation the impacts of the tax act have been recorded in tax expense from continuing operations and the details are discussed more fully in note 8  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

disposition of businesses and assets 

as part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have discontinued certain businesses when the discontinued operations represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations any business deemed to be a discontinued operation prior to the adoption of accounting standards update 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity continues to be reported as a discontinued operation and the results of operations and related cash flows are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented any remaining assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 30 2018  and december 31 2017

during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities related to our multispectral imaging business for aggregate consideration of 373 million  recognizing a pretax gain of 130 million  the pretax gain is included in interest and other expense net in the consolidated statement of operations the multispectral imaging business was a component of our discovery  analytical solutions segment the divestiture of the multispectral imaging business has not been classified as a discontinued operation in this form 10k because the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements 

during fiscal year 2017 we sold suzhou perkinelmer medical laboratory co ltd for aggregate consideration of 23 million  recognizing a pretax loss of 11 million  the pretax loss recognized in fiscal year 2017 is included in interest and other expense net in the consolidated statement of operations suzhou perkinelmer medical laboratory co ltd was a component of our diagnostics segment the divestiture of suzhou perkinelmer medical laboratory co ltd has not been classified as a discontinued operation in this form 10k because the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements 

during fiscal year 2016 we sold perkinelmer labs inc for cash consideration of 200 million  recognizing a pretax gain of 71 million  the sale generated a capital loss for tax purposes of 73 million  which resulted in an income tax benefit of 25 million  that was recognized as a discrete benefit during the second quarter of 2016 during fiscal year 2017 we recognized an additional pretax gain of 11 million  relating to the earnout consideration received from the buyer perkinelmer labs inc was a component of our diagnostics segment the pretax gain recognized in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 is included in interest and other expense net in the consolidated statements of operations the divestiture of perkinelmer labs inc has not been classified as a discontinued operation in this form 10k because the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements 

in august 1999 we sold the assets of our technical service business we recorded a pretax gain of 18 million  in fiscal year 2016  for a contingency related to this business this was recognized as a gain on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes

business combinations 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2018 

during fiscal year 2018 we completed the acquisition of four businesses for aggregate consideration of 1060 million  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforces acquired and has been allocated to goodwill which is not tax deductible we reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our diagnostics and discovery  analytical solutions segments as applicable from the acquisition dates identifiable definitelived intangible assets such as core technology trade names and customer relationships acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of 112 years

other acquisitions in 2017 during fiscal year 2017 we also completed the acquisition of two other businesses for aggregate consideration of 1420 million  the acquired businesses were tulip diagnostics private limited “tulip” which was acquired for total consideration of 1273 million  in cash and one other business acquired for total consideration of 147 million  in cash at the time of closing we had a potential obligation to pay the former shareholders of tulip up to inr 16 billion  in additional consideration over a two year period equivalent to 252 million  and is accounted for as compensation expense in our financial statements over a two year period and is excluded from the purchase price allocation shown below the excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforces acquired and has been allocated to goodwill which is not tax deductible we reported the operations of tulip within the results of our diagnostics segment and the other acquired business within the results of our discovery  analytical solutions segment from the acquisition date identifiable definitelived intangible assets such as core technology trade names and customer relationships acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of 118 years  

during fiscal year 2018 we paid the former shareholders of tulip a portion of the additional consideration amounting to inr 7163 million  equivalent to 113 million  as of december 30 2018  we may have to pay the former shareholders of tulip additional consideration of up to inr 8036 million  currently equivalent to 114 million  in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2016 

during fiscal year 2016 we completed the acquisition of two businesses for total consideration of 723 million  in cash the acquired businesses were bioo scientific corporation which was acquired for total consideration of 635 million  in cash and one other business acquired for total consideration of 88 million  in cash the excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of each of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforces acquired as a result of the acquisitions we recorded goodwill of 431 million  which is not tax deductible and intangible assets of 221 million  we have reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our diagnostics and discovery  analytical solutions segments from the acquisition dates identifiable definitelived intangible assets such as core technology trade names and customer relationships acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of 94 years  

we do not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016  with the exception of the euroimmun acquisition to be material to our consolidated results of operations therefore we are only presenting pro forma financial information of operations for the euroimmun acquisition the aggregate revenue and the results of operations for the acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2018  for the period from their acquisition dates to december 30 2018  were no t material the aggregate revenue for the acquisitions with the exception of euroimmun completed during fiscal year 2017  for the period from their acquisition dates to december 31 2017  was 385 million  and the results of operations were no t material the aggregate revenue and results of operations for the acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2016  for the period from their respective acquisition dates to january 1 2017  were minimal we also determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of those acquisitions from the date of acquisition is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition 

as of december 30 2018  the allocations of purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2017 and 2016  were final the preliminary allocations of the purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2018  were based upon initial valuations our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete our valuations within the measurement periods which are up to one year from the respective acquisition dates the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances and residual goodwill we expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition dates during the measurement periods during the measurement periods we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of those dates these adjustments will be made in the periods in which the amounts are determined and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition dates all changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement periods are also included in current period earnings 

during fiscal year 2018  we obtained information relevant to determining the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to recent acquisitions and adjusted our purchase price allocations based on this information for the euroimmun acquisition we recognized an increase in intangible assets of 100 million  an increase in other assets of 217 million  an increase in liabilities assumed of 123 million  a decrease in property and equipment of 201 million  a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of 236 million  and a decrease in goodwill of 235 million  

allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period 

as of december 30 2018  we may have to pay contingent consideration related to acquisitions with open contingency periods of up to 765 million  as of december 30 2018  we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 697 million  of which 670 million  was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 27 million  was recorded in longterm liabilities as of december 31 2017  we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 653 million  of which 522 million  was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 131 million  was recorded in long 

term liabilities the expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed 178  years from december 30 2018  and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at december 30 2018  was 5  months if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of definitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional contingent consideration which would be recognized as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations 

in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin thereon the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services we do not include any costs associated with selling effort research and development or the related margins on these costs in most acquisitions profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition the sum of the costs and operating income approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a thirdparty to assume the obligation 

contingencies including tax matters 

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 79 million  and 94 million  as of december 30 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively in accrued expenses and other current liabilities which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

various tax years after 2010  remain open to examination by certain jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such as finland germany italy netherlands singapore the united kingdom and the united states the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 

we are subject to various claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in our opinion based on our review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these contingencies at december 30 2018  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

tax in addition during fiscal year 2018 we determined that previously undistributed earnings of certain international subsidiaries no longer met the requirements of indefinite reinvestment and therefore recognized 29 million  of income tax expense during the year our intent is to continue to reinvest the remaining undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries indefinitely no additional income tax expense has been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

on july 27 2016 our board authorized us to repurchase up to 80 million  shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program on july 23 2018 our board authorized us to immediately terminate the repurchase program and further authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to 2500 million  under a new stock repurchase program the new repurchase program the new repurchase program will expire on july 23 2020 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2018 we had no stock repurchases under the repurchase program no shares remain available for repurchase under the repurchase program due to its cancellation during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018  we repurchased 650000  shares of common stock under the new repurchase program at an aggregate cost of 522 million  as of december 30 2018  1978 million  remained available for aggregate repurchases of shares under the new repurchase program 

  in addition our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans during the fiscal year 2018  we repurchased 66506  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 52 million  during fiscal year 2017  we repurchased 78644  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 44 million  during fiscal year 2016  we repurchased 75198  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 36 million  

the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the new repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability creating increased volatility in security prices widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets with respect to plans outside of the united states we expect to contribute 83 million  in the aggregate during fiscal year 2019 during fiscal year 2018  we contributed 85 million  in the aggregate to pension plans outside of the united states and 150 million  to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states for plan year 2017 during fiscal year 2017 we made contributions of 84 million  in the aggregate to plans outside of the united states during fiscal year 2016 we contributed 96 million  in the aggregate to plans outside of the united states we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans 

effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 nature of operations and accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition warranty costs bad debts inventories accounting for business combinations and dispositions longlived assets pensions and other postretirement benefits 

restructuring income taxes contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations we recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the promised products or services when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of those products or services to customers 

taxes that are collected by us from a customer and assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenueproducing transaction are excluded from revenue 

the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings accounts are writtenoff only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted 

  

inventory valuation we value inventory at the lower of cost or market inventories are accounted for using the firstin firstout method we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest inprocess research and development “iprd” is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period 

value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using a measurement date of january 1 2018  and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment at january 1 2018  the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 200  for each reporting unit except for our informatics reporting unit the range of the longterm terminal growth rates for the reporting units was 30  to 50  for the fiscal year 2018  impairment analysis the range for the discount rates for the reporting units was 90  to 150  keeping all other variables constant a 100  change in any one of these input assumptions for the various reporting units except for our informatics reporting unit would still allow us to conclude that there was no impairment of goodwill 

we consistently employed the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce tax rates capital spending discount rates and working capital changes cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years’ cash flows and historical relationships in later years the income approach is sensitive to changes in longterm terminal growth rates and the discount rates the longterm terminal growth rates are consistent with our historical longterm terminal growth rates as the current economic trends are not expected to affect our longterm terminal growth rates we corroborate the income approach with a market approach 

our informatics reporting unit which had a goodwill balance of 2172 million  at january 1 2018  had a fair value that was less than 20 but greater than 10 more than its carrying value informatics is at increased risk of an impairment charge given its ongoing weakness due to a highly competitive industry despite the increased risk associated with this reporting unit we do not believe there will be a significant change in the key estimates or assumptions driving the fair value of this reporting unit that would lead to a material impairment charge while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future 

nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test we consistently employed the relief from royalty model to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of nonamortizing intangible asset the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the nonamortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a nonamortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of the amortizing intangible asset in addition we evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible asset at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of our nonamortizing intangible asset is no longer indefinite the asset will be tested for impairment this intangible asset will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 

we performed our annual impairment testing as of january 1 2018  and concluded that there was no impairment of nonamortizing intangible asset an assessment of the recoverability of amortizing intangible assets takes place when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment no such events occurred during fiscal year 2018  

employee compensation and benefits we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar monthend that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement 

we recognized a loss  of 119 million  in fiscal year 2018  income  of 104 million  in fiscal year 2017  and a loss  of 145 million  in fiscal year 2016  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans which includes the charge or benefit for the 

marktomarket adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans which was recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the loss or income related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans was a pretax loss  of 214 million  in fiscal year 2018  a pretax gain  of 21 million  in fiscal year 2017  and a pretax loss  of 153 million  in fiscal year 2016  we expect income of approximately 12 million  in fiscal year 2019  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans excluding the charge for or benefit from the marktomarket adjustment it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a marktomarket adjustment in fiscal year 2019  marktomarket adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control including changes in interest rates the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease markto market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2019  conversely to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected markto market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2019  pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year beginning in fiscal year 2016 the approach we use to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for certain nonus benefit plans was changed to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs prior to fiscal year 2016 we calculated these service and interest components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in fiscal year 2016 we have elected to utilize an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period 

as of december 30 2018  we estimate the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 725  and to be 530  for all plans outside the united states in addition as of december 30 2018  we estimate the discount rate for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 405  and to be 207  for all plans outside the united states during fiscal year 2016 for the plans in the united states the society of actuaries issued an updated projection scale mp2016 which reduced the life expectancy used to determine the projected benefit obligation we adopted mp2016 as of january 1 2017 the adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a 55 million  decrease to the projected benefit obligation at january 1 2017 we adopted a further updated projection scale mp2017 as of december 31 2017 the adoption of mp2017 resulted in a 26 million  decrease to the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2017 during fiscal year 2018 the society of actuaries issued mp2018 mortality improvement rates to replace mp2017 rates for use with the rp2014 mortality table which incorporates an additional year 2016 of us population we adopted mp2018 as of december 30 2018 the adoption of mp2018 resulted in a 10 million  decrease to the projected benefit obligation at december 30 2018 we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date 

if any of our assumptions were to change as of december 30 2018  our pension plan expenses would also change 



we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is 

limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and contractual agreements ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and iii impairment of assets as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled “restructuring and contract termination charges net” 

dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation which meets the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated any such changes decrease or increase current earnings during the fiscal year ended december 30 2018  we had no disposition of discontinued operations 

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine our current tax provision as well as enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled to determine our deferred tax provision any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us internal revenue code which include reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the end of the measurement period for purposes of staff accounting bulletin no 118 was december 22 2018 we have completed the analysis based on legislative updates relating to the tax act currently available and has recorded the impact in tax expense from continuing operations the details are discussed more fully in note 8 income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we will be subject to the new global intangible low tax income gilti tax rules that are part of the modified territorial tax system imposed by the tax act under us gaap we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes the “deferred method” we decided to adopt the period cost method and thus have not recorded any potential deferred tax effects related to gilti and fdii in our financial statements for the fiscal year ended december 30 2018 

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

additionally we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards state income tax credit carryforwards and certain foreign tax attributes valuation allowances 

take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision 

historically deferred income tax expense has not been provided on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries during fiscal year 2018 we determined that previously undistributed earnings of certain international subsidiaries of approximately 10 billion  no longer met the requirements of indefinite reinvestment and therefore we recognized 29 million  of income tax expense in fiscal year 2018 our intent is to continue to reinvest the remaining undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries indefinitely while federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the tax act we have not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes state income tax or foreign exchange gain or loss as of december 30 2018  the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the us indefinitely and for which no additional incremental us tax cost has been provided other than the 804 million  from the onetime transition tax on deemed repatriation was approximately 6521 million  it is not practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to such incremental tax costs on those earnings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments derivatives marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december 30 2018  

  we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments by nature all financial instruments involve market and credit risks we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments approximately 70  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can increase the costs of financing investing and operating the business 

  in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months  have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows 

principal hedged currencies include the british pound euro swedish krona chinese yuan and singapore dollar we held forward foreign exchange contracts designated as economic hedges with us dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling 2233 million  at december 30 2018  2121 million  at december 31 2017  and 1375 million  at january 1 2017  and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material the duration of these contracts was generally 30  days or less during each of fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016  

in addition in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance our acquisitions and stock repurchase program we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies we record these hedges at fair value on our 

consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on these hedges as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within our consolidated statement of cash flows 

the outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges which were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements included combined euro notional amounts of €373 million  and combined us dollar notional amounts of 57 million  as of december 30 2018  combined euro notional amounts of €572 million  and combined us dollar notional amounts of 13 billion  as of december 31 2017  and combined euro notional amounts of €586 million  combined us dollar notional amounts of 87 million  and combined swedish krona notional amounts of kr9695 million  as of january 1 2017  the net gains and losses on these derivatives combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material for each of the fiscal years 2018 and 2017  we paid 341 million  and 138 million  during the fiscal years 2018 and 2017  respectively from the settlement of these hedges 

 during fiscal year 2018 we entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of €2987 million  to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges were included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci which offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries the cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold the foreign currency forward contracts were settled during the second quarter of 2018 and we recorded a net realized foreign exchange loss in aoci of 26 million  for the fiscal year ended december 30 2018  

during fiscal year 2016 we designated the 2026 notes to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries in january 2018 we removed the hedging relationship of our 2026 notes and investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and recognized 21 million  of unrealized foreign exchange gain in aoci in april 2018 we designated a portion of the 2026 notes to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries unrealized translation adjustments from a portion of the 2026 notes were included in the foreign currency translation component of aoci which offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries the cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold as of december 30 2018  the total notional amount of the 2026 notes that was designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was €2160 million  the unrealized foreign exchange gain recorded in aoci related to the net investment hedge was 93 million  for the fiscal year ended december 30 2018  

during fiscal year 2018  we designated the april 2021 notes to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries unrealized translation adjustments from the april 2021 notes were included in the foreign currency translation component of aoci which offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries the cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold as of december 30 2018  the total notional amount of the april 2021 notes that was designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was €2987 million  the unrealized foreign exchange gain recorded in aoci related to the net investment hedge was 275 million  for the fiscal year ended december 30 2018  

market risk 

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 70  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in natural hedges 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be positively but not proportionately impacted conversely when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be negatively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95  confidence interval and a holding period of 30  days as of december 30 2018  this computation estimated that there is a 5  chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 01 million  this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2018  the valueatrisk ranged between 01 million  and 11 million  with an average of approximately 05 million  

  

interest rate risk as of december 30 2018  we had 4180 million  in outstanding borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility as described above in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” amounts drawn under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 1631 million  at december 30 2018  fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

interest rate risk—sensitivity  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

i changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows to fluctuate an increase of 10  or approximately 36  basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 15 million  for fiscal year 2019  

  

ii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 30 2018  the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 30 2018  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

during the fiscal quarter ended december 30 2018 we implemented a plan that called for modifications and additions to our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for leases as a result of the new lease accounting standard the modified and new controls have been designed to address risks associated with recognizing leases under the new standard and disclosures required before the standards effective date we have therefore augmented our internal control over financial reporting as follows 

 

• enhanced the risk assessment process to take into account risks associated with the new lease accounting standard 

there was no other change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 30 2018 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

recent developments 

as part of our strategy to grow our core businesses we have recently taken the following actions 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2017 

we completed the acquisition of three businesses in fiscal year 2017 for total consideration of 16 billion  the acquired businesses were euroimmun medizinische labordiagnostika ag “euroimmun” acquired for total consideration of €12 billion  tulip diagnostics private limited “tulip” acquired for total consideration of 1273 million  and one other business acquired for total consideration of 148 million  we have a potential obligation to pay the former shareholders of tulip up to inr 16 billion  in additional consideration over a two year period which is currently equivalent to 252 million  and is accounted for as compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements over a two year period and is excluded from the purchase price allocation we reported the operations of euroimmun and tulip within the results of our diagnostics segment and the other acquisition within the results of our discovery  analytical solutions segment from the acquisition dates 

restructuring 

during fiscal year 2017  we recorded pretax restructuring charges of 80 million  in our discovery  analytical solutions segment and 29 million  in our diagnostics segment related to a workforce reduction from restructuring activities our management approved these plans to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives we also terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges to the extent applicable for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us we recorded pretax charges of 36 million  in the discovery  analytical solutions segment and 05 million  in the diagnostics segment during fiscal year 2017  as a result of these contract terminations 

this pretax restructuring activity has been reported as restructuring and contract termination charges and is included as a component of income from continuing operations we expect no significant impact on future operating results or cash flows from the restructuring activities executed in fiscal year 2017

marketing 

all of our businesses market their products and services primarily through their own specialized sales forces as of december 31 2017  we employed approximately 4000  sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35  countries and marketing products and services in more than 150  countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials key components and supplies 

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with our suppliers for certain critical raw materials key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components see the applicable risk factor in “item 1a risk factors” for an additional description of this risk 

  

intellectual property 

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to 

significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties 

  

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required for a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

due to the range and diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors our competitors range from foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to more narrowly focused firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation operational efficiency product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market positions we expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

research and development 

research and development expenditures were 1394 million  during fiscal year 2017  1243 million  during fiscal year 2016  and 1125 million  during fiscal year 2015  

  

we have a broad product base and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs to accelerate our growth initiatives we directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015  primarily toward our diagnostics segment and the environmental food life sciences research and laboratory services markets within our discovery  analytical solutions segment we expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2018  and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics segment and the environmental food life sciences research and laboratory services markets within our discovery  analytical solutions segment 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing uses emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 94 million  and 99 million  as of december 31 2017  and january 1 2017  respectively which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding 

the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we employed approximately 11000  employees in our continuing operations several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of december 31 2017  we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately 1700  union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

financial information about business segments 

we have included the expenses for our corporate headquarters such as legal tax audit human resources information technology and other management and compliance costs as well as the activity related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans as “corporate” below we have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses these amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments 

  

the table below sets forth revenue and operating income loss from continuing operations by operating segment for the fiscal years ended 

  



 

 

discontinued operations have not been included in the preceding table 

additional information relating to our reporting segments is as follows for the fiscal years ended 

  



  



financial information about geographic areas 

both of our reporting segments conduct business in and derive substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during fiscal year 2017  we had 14200 million  in sales from our international operations representing approximately 60  of our total sales during fiscal year 2017  we derived approximately 70  of our international sales from our discovery  analytical solutions segment and approximately 30  of our international sales from our diagnostics segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future 

  

we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements additional geographic information is discussed in note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding restrictions in capital expenditures general economic conditions cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our 

consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

our growth is subject to global economic and political conditions and operational disruptions at our facilities 

our business is affected by global economic and political conditions as well as the state of the financial markets particularly as the united states and other countries balance concerns around debt inflation growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives there can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows results of operations financial position or our ability to access capital such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the united states and internationally our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location 

while we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities a major earthquake fire flood power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments or other measures and some of these risks are insurable but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

 many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or divestitures license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our acquisitions of euroimmun and tulip during fiscal year 2017 however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons such as 

 some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition if for example we are unable to successfully commercialize products and services related to significant inprocess research and development that we have capitalized we may have to impair the value of such assets accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences loss of key personnel unforeseen regulatory requirements previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results additionally if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies which may adversely impact our profitability 

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies the expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market or incur losses for 

failing to comply with our contractual obligations in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs as a result small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 



a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the united states postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals tantalum tin gold tungsten and their derivatives that may be contained in our products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as a result of these rules we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the components used in our products be certified as conflictfree and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs 

the manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product and other liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product and other liability claims if our products services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies in the united states and abroad we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil criminal or monetary penalties 

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions some of our products are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

we are also subject to a variety of laws regulations and standards that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances and our business practices in the united states and abroad such as antibribery anticorruption and competition laws this requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws regulations and standards a failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2017  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and scientists and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the 

turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or those of our customers suppliers or other third parties allowing inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or if we fail to implement new systems software and technologies successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to develop manufacture and provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers suppliers or other third parties it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems allowing inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

we have a substantial amount of outstanding debt which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business 

  

we have a substantial amount of debt and other financial obligations our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 in addition we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility senior unsecured term loan credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility senior unsecured term loan credit facility senior unsecured notes due in 2021 2021 notes and senior unsecured notes due in 2026 2026 notes include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company these include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

 we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments 

any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility senior unsecured term loan credit facility the 2021 notes the 2026 notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances 

the united kingdoms vote in favor of withdrawing from the european union could adversely impact our results of operations 

nearly 3 of our net sales from continuing operations in fiscal year 2017  came from the united kingdom following the referendum vote in the united kingdom in june 2016 in favor of leaving the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” on march 29 2017 the country formally notified the european union of its intention to withdraw it appears likely that this withdrawal will involve a process of lengthy negotiations between the united kingdom and european union member states to determine the future terms of the united kingdom’s relationship with the european union this could lead to a period of considerable uncertainty and volatility particularly in relation to united kingdom financial and banking markets weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm our business and if such conditions emerge in the united kingdom or in the rest of europe it may have a material adverse effect on our operations and sales 

any significant weakening of the british pound sterling to the us dollar will have an adverse impact on our european revenues due to the importance of our sales in the united kingdom currency exchange rates in the pound sterling and the euro with respect to each other and the us dollar have already been adversely affected by brexit and that may continue to be the case in addition depending on the terms of brexit the united kingdom could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the european union on behalf of its members which may result in increased trade barriers which could make our doing business in europe more difficult 

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

as of december 31 2017  our total assets included 43 billion  of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights customer relationships core technology and technology licenses and inprocess research and development net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets 

adverse changes in our business adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units or the failure to grow our discovery  analytical solutions and diagnostics segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our share price will fluctuate 

over the last several years stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 

 dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

on october 27 2017  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2017  that was paid in february 2018  on january 25 2018  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the first  quarter of fiscal year 2018  that will be payable in may 2018  in the future our 

board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

overview of fiscal year 2017   

during fiscal year 2017  we continued to see good performance from acquisitions investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives our overall revenue in fiscal year 2017   increase d 1415 million  or 7  as compared to fiscal year 2016  reflecting an increase  of 655 million  or 4  in our discovery  analytical solutions segment revenue and an increase  of 760 million  or 13  in our diagnostics segment revenue the increase  in our discovery  analytical solutions segment during fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to an increase  of 481 million  from our laboratory services market revenue and an increase  of 211 million  from our environmental food and industrial markets revenue partially offset by a decrease  of 38 million  from our life sciences research market revenue the increase  in our diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2017  was primarily driven by continued expansion in our newborn maternal fetal health and infectious diseases screening solutions and applied genomics solutions 

in our discovery  analytical solutions segment we experienced growth during fiscal year 2017 driven by successful new product introductions and an improving macroenvironment we also experienced strong demand for our laboratory service offerings as well as our environmental and food offerings in the life sciences research market we experienced continued decline in sales of radioactive reagents in our radionucleotide business 

in our diagnostics segment we experienced growth from continued expansion in our newborn and infectious disease screening businesses particularly in the emerging markets we also experienced strong growth in our advanced genomics frontend sample preparation business in the americas as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers we anticipate that the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease which can result in a reduction of longterm health care costs as well as create better outcomes for patients are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets during fiscal year 2017  we expanded both the extent and reach of our capabilities to enable earlier treatments and better outcomes both in terms of diseases and geographies the acquisition of euroimmun has increased our reagent mix expanded our technical capabilities and positioned us in more attractive markets 

our consolidated gross margins decrease d 36  basis points in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  primarily due to an unfavorable shift in product mix partially offset by benefits from our initiatives to improve our supply chain our consolidated operating margin increase d 12  basis points in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  primarily due to lower costs as a result of cost containment and productivity initiatives which were partially offset by increased costs related to investments in new product development 

we continue to believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the spending trends in our end markets and to promote efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services overall we believe that our strategic focus on diagnostics and discovery and analytical solutions markets coupled with our deep portfolio of technologies and applications leading market positions global scale and financial strength will provide us with a foundation for growth

restructuring and contract termination charges net 

we have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures the alignment of our operations with our growth strategy the integration of our business units and productivity initiatives restructuring and contract termination charges for fiscal year 2017  were 127 million  as compared to 51 million  for fiscal year 2016  and 135 million  for fiscal year 2015  

we implemented a restructuring plan in each of the fourth and third quarters of fiscal year 2017 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives the q4 2017 plan and q3 2017 plan respectively we implemented a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 consisting of workforce reductions and the closure of excess facility space principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets the q1 2017 plan we implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to focus resources on higher growth product lines the q3 2016 plan we implemented a restructuring plan in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets the q2 2016 plan we implemented a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 consisting of workforce reductions and the closure of excess facility space principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets the q4 2015 plan we implemented a restructuring plan in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives the q2 2015 plan all other previous restructuring plans were workforce reductions or closure of excess facility space principally intended to integrate our businesses in order to realign operations reduce costs achieve operational efficiencies and shift resources into geographic regions and end markets that are more consistent with our growth strategy the previous plans 

the following table summarizes the number of employees reduced the initial restructuring or contract termination charges by operating segment and the dates by which payments were substantially completed or the expected dates by which payments will be substantially completed for restructuring actions implemented during fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015  in continuing operations 



we expect to make payments under the previous plans for remaining residual lease obligations with terms varying in length through fiscal year 2022  

we also have terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges to the extent applicable for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us we recorded additional pretax charges of 36 million  01 million  and 01 million  in the discovery  analytical solutions segment during fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015  respectively and 05 million  during fiscal year 2017  in the diagnostics segment as a result of these contract terminations

interest and other expense net 

interest and other expense net consisted of the following 



2017  compared to 2016  interest and other expense net for fiscal year 2017  was an expense  of 81 million  as compared to an expense  of 390 million  for fiscal year 2016  a decrease  of 309 million  the decrease  in interest and other expense net in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  was largely due to a decrease in other expense net by 373 million  which consisted primarily of net foreign exchange gain related to remeasurement and settlement of the acquisitionrelated hedges of 365 million  and an increase in interest income of 19 million  in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  interest income increased primarily due to interest income derived from investing the proceeds from the sale of our medical imaging business in money market mutual funds until these proceeds were redeemed by end of fiscal year 2017  to partially fund the euroimmun purchase price consideration this was partially offset by a net loss on disposition of businesses and assets of 03 million  in fiscal year 2017  as compared to a net gain of 56 million  in fiscal year 2016  and an increase in interest expense of 24 million  in fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  due to the impact of four quarters of interest expense on our 2026 notes in fiscal year 2017  as compared to two quarters of interest expense in fiscal year 2016  as the 2026 notes were issued in july 2016 a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

2016  compared to 2015  interest and other expense net for fiscal year 2016  was an expense  of 390 million  as compared to an expense  of 421 million  for fiscal year 2015  a decrease  of 31 million  the decrease  in interest and other expense net in fiscal year 2016  as compared to fiscal year 2015  was primarily due to a gain on disposition of businesses and assets net recognized in fiscal year 2016 which was partially offset by an increase  in interest expense of 35 million  for fiscal year 2016  as compared to fiscal year 2015  due to the issuance of the new higher interest rate 2026 notes which replaced our lower cost debt outstanding on our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility other expenses for fiscal year 2016   decrease d by 11 million  as compared to fiscal year 2015  primarily due to expenses related to foreign currency transactions and translation of nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates on continuing operations were 471  116  and 96  for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015  respectively certain of our subsidiaries have at various times been granted tax relief in their respective countries resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates a reconciliation of income tax expense at the us federal statutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended 

  



  

the variation in our effective tax rate for each year is primarily a result of the recognition of earnings in foreign jurisdictions predominantly singapore finland netherlands and china which are taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate resulting in a benefit from income taxes of 559 million  in fiscal year 2017  482 million  in fiscal year 2016  and 361 million  in fiscal year 2015  these amounts include 101 million  in fiscal year 2017  114 million  in fiscal year 2016  and 83 million  in fiscal year 2015  of benefits derived from tax holidays in china and singapore the effect of these benefits derived from tax holidays on basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2017  was 009  and 009  respectively for fiscal year 2016  was 010  and 010  respectively and for fiscal year 2015  was 007  and 007  respectively the tax holiday in one of our subsidiaries in china expired in 2017 and the tax holiday in one other subsidiary in china is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2019  the tax holiday in one of our subsidiaries in singapore is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2018  

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed into law tax reform legislation known as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us internal revenue code which includes reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 

we have performed a preliminary analysis of the impacts of the tax act based on currently available information and recorded a discrete tax expense of 1065 million  during fiscal year 2017 which was comprised of 215 million  from the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower enacted corporate income tax rate and 850 million  from the onetime deemed repatriation tax on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries the impact of the tax act may differ from our estimates due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made internal revenue service and treasury department guidance that may be issued and actions we may take the effects of the tax act provisions are still being evaluated by management and there could be additional effects of the tax act which could have material positive or negative impacts on our current or future tax position 

disposition of businesses and assets 

as part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have discontinued certain businesses when the discontinued operations represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations any business deemed to be a discontinued operation prior to the adoption of accounting standards update 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity asu 201408  continues to be reported as a discontinued operation and the results of operations and related cash flows are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented any remaining assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2017  and january 1 2017

during fiscal year 2016 we sold perkinelmer labs inc for cash consideration of 200 million  recognizing a pretax gain of 71 million  the sale generated a capital loss for tax purposes of 73 million  which resulted in an income tax benefit of 25 million  that was recognized as a discrete benefit during the second quarter of 2016 during fiscal year 2017  we recognized an additional pretax gain of 11 million  relating to the earnout consideration received from the buyer perkinelmer labs inc was a component of our diagnostics segment the pretax gain recognized in fiscal years 2017 and 2016  is included in interest and other expense net in the consolidated statement of operations the divestiture of perkinelmer labs inc has not been classified as a discontinued operation in this form 10k because the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements

following the closing we are providing certain customary transitional services during a period of up to 12 months  commercial transactions between the parties following the closing of the transaction are not expected to be significant 

we presented our medical imaging business as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years 2016 and 2015 the results of discontinued operations during fiscal year 2017 include the results of the medical imaging business through april 30 2017

during fiscal year 2016  we completed the acquisition of two businesses for total consideration of 723 million  in cash the acquired businesses were bioo scientific corporation which was acquired for total consideration of 635 million  in cash and one other business acquired for total consideration of 88 million  in cash the excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of each of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforces acquired as a result of the acquisitions we recorded goodwill of 431 million  which is not tax deductible and intangible assets of 221 million  we have reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our diagnostics and discovery  analytical solutions segments from the acquisition dates identifiable definitelived intangible assets such as core technology trade names and customer relationships acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of 94 years

we do not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015  with the exception of the euroimmun acquisition to be material to our consolidated results of operations therefore we are only presenting pro forma financial information of operations for the euroimmun acquisition the aggregate revenue for the acquisitions with the exception of euroimmun completed during fiscal year 2017  for the period from their acquisition dates to december 31 2017  was 385 million  and the results of operations were not material the aggregate revenue and results of operations for the acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2016 and 2015  for the period from their respective acquisition dates to december 31 2017  and january 1 2017  were minimal we have also determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of those acquisitions from the date of acquisition is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition 

as of december 31 2017  the allocations of purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2016 and 2015  were final the preliminary allocations of the purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2017  were based upon initial valuations our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete our valuations within the measurement periods which are up to one year from the respective acquisition dates the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances and residual goodwill we expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition dates during the measurement periods during the measurement periods we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of those dates with our adoption of accounting standards update no 201516 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments asu no 201516 during 2015 these adjustments will be made in the periods in which the amounts are determined and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition dates all changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement periods are also included in current period earnings 

during fiscal year 2017  we obtained information relevant to determining the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to recent acquisitions and adjusted our purchase price allocations based on this information for the bioo acquisition we recognized an increase in intangible assets of 22 million  a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of 05 million  a decrease in current assets of 01 million  and a decrease in goodwill of 26 million  and for the tulip acquisition we recognized an increase in property and equipment of 17 million  with a corresponding decrease in goodwill 

allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period 

as of december 31 2017  we may have to pay contingent consideration related to acquisitions with open contingency periods of up to 830 million  as of december 31 2017  we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 653 million  of which 522 million  was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 131 million  was recorded in longterm liabilities as of january 1 2017  we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 632 million  of which 154 million  was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 478 million  was recorded in longterm liabilities the expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed 175  years from the respective acquisition dates and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at december 31 2017  was 11  months if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of definitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional contingent consideration which would be recognized as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations 

in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin thereon the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on 

the historical direct costs related to providing the services we do not include any costs associated with selling effort research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs in most acquisitions profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition the sum of the costs and operating income approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a thirdparty to assume the obligation 

contingencies including tax matters 

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 94 million  and 99 million  as of december 31 2017  and january 1 2017  respectively in accrued expenses and other current liabilities which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

various tax years after 2010  remain open to examination by certain jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such as finland germany italy netherlands singapore the united kingdom and the united states the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 

we are subject to various claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in our opinion based on our review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these contingencies at december 31 2017  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

 prior to april 19 2026 three months prior to their maturity date we may redeem the 2026 notes in whole at any time or in part from time to time at our option at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the 2026 notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2026 notes being redeemed discounted on an annual basis at the applicable comparable government bond rate as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 notes plus 35 basis points plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest in addition at any time on or after april 19 2026 three months prior to their maturity date we may redeem the 2026 notes at our option at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2026 notes due to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 

upon a change of control as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 notes and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2026 notes below investment grade we will in certain circumstances make an offer to purchase the 2026 notes at a price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest 

other debt facilities  we assumed other debt facilities pursuant to the euroimmun acquisition which includes eurodenominated bank loans with an aggregate carrying value of €476 million  equivalent to 572 million  as of december 31 2017  these bank loans are primarily utilized for financing fixed assets and are repaid in monthly or quarterly installments with maturity dates extending to 2031 the bank loans in the aggregate amount of 448 million  bear fixed interest rates between 11  and 79  and bank loans in the aggregate amount of 124 million  bear variable interest rates based on the euribor rate plus a margin between 13  and 15  an aggregate amount of 150 million  of the bank loans are secured by mortgages on the financed land and buildings and the remaining 422 million  are unsecured certain credit agreements for the unsecured bank loans include financial covenants which are based on an equity ratio or an equity ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december 31 2017  

in addition we have other unsecured revolving credit facilities and a secured bank loan in the amount of 27 million  and 03 million  respectively as of december 31 2017  the unsecured revolving debt facilities bear fixed interest rates between 005 and 195 and will mature in 2018 the secured bank loan of 03 million bears a fixed annual interest rate of 195 and is repaid in monthly installments until 2027 

financing lease obligations in fiscal year 2012 we entered into agreements with the lessors of certain buildings that we are currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings we provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings and as a result we were considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period at the end of the construction period we were not reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs we are therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases qualify as financing leases under saleleaseback accounting guidance representing debt obligations for us and noncash investing and financing activities as a result we capitalized 293 million  in property plant and equipment net representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt we have also capitalized 115 million  in additional construction costs necessary to complete the renovations to the buildings which were funded by the lessors with a corresponding increase to debt at december 31 2017  we had 359 million  recorded for these financing lease obligations of which 14 million  was recorded as shortterm debt and 345 million  was recorded as longterm debt at january 1 2017  we had 371 million  recorded for these financing lease obligations of which 12 million  was recorded as shortterm debt and 359 million  was recorded as longterm debt the buildings are being depreciated on a straightline basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values which will equal the remaining financing obligation at the end of the lease term at the end of the lease term the remaining balances in property plant and equipment net and debt will be reversed against each other 

dividends 

our board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 007  per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2017 and 2016  resulting in an annual dividend rate of 028  per share at december 31 2017  we had accrued 77 million for a dividend declared on october 27 2017 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017  that was paid in february 2018  on january 25 2018  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the first  quarter of fiscal year 2018  that will be payable in may 2018  in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2017  for continuing and discontinued operations purchase commitments are minimal and have been excluded from this table 

  

 

   

as of december 31 2017  we may have to pay the shareholders of our acquisition contingent consideration of up to 830 million  the table above does not reflect any of these obligations as the timing and amounts are uncertain for further information related to our contingent consideration obligations see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

capital expenditures 

during fiscal year 2018  we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2017  primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

at december 31 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of 2021 million  of which 1875 million  was held by our nonus subsidiaries and we had 3636 million  of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility we had no other liquid investments at december 31 2017  

  we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed as a result of the sale of our medical imaging business we sold assets and liabilities of certain foreign operations liquidated a related foreign entity and repatriated approximately 636 million  of previously unremitted earnings we provided for the estimated taxes on the repatriation of these earnings and recorded a tax expense of 42 million  in discontinued operations and dispositions for fiscal year 2017  we expect to utilize tax attributes to minimize the cash taxes paid on the repatriation 

the tax act among other items requires us to pay a onetime tax on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017  the amount of foreign earnings that we have invested outside the us was approximately 14 billion  based on available information we estimated the tax on the deemed repatriation of our foreign earnings and have recorded a tax expense of 850 million  in continuing operations this estimated discrete tax provision incorporates assumptions made based upon our current interpretation of the tax act and may change as additional clarification and implementation guidance becomes available during 2018 

  on july 27 2016 our board authorized us to repurchase up to 80 million  shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program the repurchase program will expire on july 26 2018 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2017  we had no  stock repurchases under the repurchase program as of december 31 2017  80 million  shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program 

  in addition our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans during fiscal year 2017  we repurchased 78644  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 44 million  during fiscal year 2016  we repurchased 75198  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 36 million  during fiscal year 2015  we repurchased 95129  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 44 million  

the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability creating increased volatility in security prices widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets with respect to plans outside of the united states we expect to contribute 88 million  in the aggregate during fiscal year 2018 in january 2018 we made a voluntary contribution of 150 million  to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states for plan year 2017 during fiscal year 2017  we contributed 84 million  in the aggregate to pension plans outside of the united states during fiscal year 2016 we made contributions of 96 million  in the aggregate to plans outside of the united states during fiscal year 2015 we contributed 149 million  in the aggregate to plans outside of the united states and 200 million  to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans 

effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 

see note 1  nature of operations and accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition warranty costs bad debts inventories accounting for business combinations and dispositions longlived assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making 

judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for products that include installation and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete for revenue that includes customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue after the acceptance criteria have been met certain of our products require specialized installation revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as services are rendered 

in limited circumstances we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component including cord blood processing and storage for these arrangements the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a sellingprice hierarchy a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis a delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting the selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe if such evidence is available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and managements best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available tpe is the price of our or any competitors largely interchangeable products or services in standalone sales to similarlysituated customers besp is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis considering market conditions and entityspecific factors 

  

revenue from software licenses and services was 4  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2017  and 5  for each of fiscal years 2016 and 2015  we sell our software licenses with maintenance services and in some cases also with consulting services for the undelivered elements we determine vsoe of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately we determine vsoe for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the stated renewal rate method we determine vsoe for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements on a standalone basis 

  

we recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance andor consulting services upon shipment using the residual method provided that the above criteria have been met if vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered or if the only undelivered element is maintenance then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period 

  

the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings accounts are writtenoff only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted 

  

inventory valuation we value inventory at the lower of cost or market inventories are accounted for using the firstin firstout method we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic 

levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest inprocess research and development “iprd” is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period 

value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using measurement dates of january 2 2017  and january 4 2016  and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment at january 2 2017  the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 200  for each reporting unit except for our informatics reporting unit at january 2 2017  and january 1 2018 our informatics reporting unit which had a goodwill balance of 2172 million  at december 31 2017  had a fair value that was less than 20 but greater than 10 more than its carrying value informatics is at increased risk of an impairment charge given its ongoing weakness due to a highly competitive industry despite the increased risk associated with this reporting unit we do not believe there will be a significant change in the key estimates or assumptions driving the fair value of this reporting unit that would lead to a material impairment charge while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future 

nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the nonamortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a nonamortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible asset at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of our nonamortizing intangible asset is no longer indefinite the asset will be tested for impairment this intangible asset will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 

employee compensation and benefits we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue research and development and selling general and 

administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar monthend that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement 

we recognized a gain  of 104 million  in fiscal year 2017  a loss  of 145 million  in fiscal year 2016  and a loss  of 94 million  in fiscal year 2015  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans which includes the charge or benefit for the marktomarket adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans which was recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the loss or income related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans was a pretax gain  of 21 million  in fiscal year 2017  a pretax loss  of 153 million  in fiscal year 2016  and pretax loss  of 124 million  in fiscal year 2015  we expect income of approximately 57 million  in fiscal year 2018  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans excluding the charge for or benefit from the marktomarket adjustment it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a marktomarket adjustment in fiscal year 2018  marktomarket adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control including changes in interest rates the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease markto market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2018  conversely to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected markto market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2018  pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year beginning in fiscal year 2016 the approach we use to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for certain nonus benefit plans was changed to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs prior to fiscal year 2016 we calculated these service and interest components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in fiscal year 2016 we have elected to utilize an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period 

as of december 31 2017  we estimate the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 725  and to be 600  for all plans outside the united states in addition as of december 31 2017  we estimate the discount rate for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 356  and to be 199  for all plans outside the united states for the plans in the united states we adopted the updated projection scale mp2015 that was published by the society of actuaries in 2015 as of january 3 2016 the adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a 68 million  decrease to the projected benefit obligation as of january 3 2016 during fiscal year 2016 the society of actuaries issued an updated projection scale mp2016 which reduced the life expectancy used to determine the projected benefit obligation we adopted mp2016 as of january 1 2017 the adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a 55 million  decrease to the projected benefit obligation at january 1 2017 during fiscal year 2017 the society of actuaries issued an updated projection scale mp2017 which reduced the life expectancy used to determine the projected benefit obligations we adopted mp2017 as of december 31 2017 the adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a 26 million  decrease to the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2017 we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date 

if any of our assumptions were to change as of december 31 2017  our pension plan expenses would also change 



we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and contractual agreements ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and iii impairment of assets as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled “restructuring and contract termination charges net” 

dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation which meets the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated any such changes decrease or increase current earnings during the fiscal year ended december 31 2017  net pretax gain s from the disposition of discontinued operations was 1796 million  

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine our current tax provision as well as enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled to determine our deferred tax provision any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us internal revenue code which includes reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries we have performed a preliminary analysis of the impacts of the tax act using information available at this time and recorded the discrete tax expense in continuing operations the impact of the tax act may differ from our estimates due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made internal revenue service and treasury department guidance that may be issued and actions we may take the 

effects of tax act provisions are still being evaluated by management and there could be additional effects of the tax act which could have material positive or negative impacts on our current or future tax position 

we will be subject to the new global intangible low tax income gilti tax rules that are part of the modified territorial tax system imposed by the tax act because of the complexity of the new rules we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the tax act and the application of asc 740 under us gaap we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes the “deferred method” our selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new gilti tax rules will depend in part on analyzing our global income to determine whether we expect to have future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti and if so what the impact is expected to be because whether we expect to have future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti depends not only on our current structure and estimated future results of global operations but also on our intent and ability to modify our structure andor our business we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of the tax act therefore we have not made any adjustments related to potential gilti tax in our financial statements and have not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes on gilti 

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

additionally we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards state income tax credit carryforwards and certain foreign tax attributes valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision 

we plan to keep our unremitted foreign earnings indefinitely reinvested overseas except for instances where we can remit such earnings to the us without an associated net tax cost such as withholding or state and local taxes our indefinite reinvestment determination is based on the future operational and capital requirements of our us and nonus operations as of december 31 2017  the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the us indefinitely and for which no incremental us tax cost has been provided other than the 850 million  from the onetime transition tax on deemed repatriation was approximately 14 billion  it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to such incremental tax costs on those earnings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments derivatives marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december 31 2017  

  

we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments by nature all financial instruments involve market and credit risks we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use 

leveraged financial instruments approximately 60  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can increase the costs of financing investing and operating the business 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months  have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statement of cash flows 

  

principal hedged currencies include the british pound euro swedish krona japanese yen and singapore dollar we held forward foreign exchange contracts designated as economic hedges with us dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling 2121 million  at december 31 2017  1375 million  at january 1 2017  and 1273 million  at january 3 2016  and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material the duration of these contracts was generally 30  days or less during each of fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015  

in addition in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance our acquisitions and stock repurchase program we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies we record these hedges at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on these hedges as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within our consolidated statement of cash flows 

the outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges which were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements included combined euro notional amounts of €572 million  and combined us dollar notional amounts of 13 billion  as of december 31 2017  combined euro notional amounts of €586 million  combined us dollar notional amounts of 87 million  and combined swedish krona notional amounts of kr9695 million  as of january 1 2017  and combined euro notional amounts of €1074 million  as of january 3 2016  the net gains and losses on these derivatives combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material for each of the fiscal years 2017 and 2016  we paid 138 million  and 19 million  during the fiscal years 2017 and 2016  respectively from the settlement of these hedges 

during fiscal year 2016 we designated the 2026 notes to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges were included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci which offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries the cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold as of december 31 2017  the total notional amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was €4961 million  the unrealized foreign exchange loss gain recorded in aoci related to the net investment hedge was 730 million  and 238 million  for the fiscal years 2017 and 2016  respectively in january 2018 we removed the hedging relationship of our 2026 notes and our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and recognized 21 million  of unrealized foreign exchange gain in aoci the translation adjustment of the 2026 notes will be recognized in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operations prospectively 

during fiscal year 2017  we entered into several foreign currency forward contracts to purchase euros to partly mitigate the currency exchange risk associated with the payment of the eurodenominated purchase price for euroimmun these currency forward contracts were not designated as hedging instruments and therefore the change in the derivative fair value was marked to market through the consolidated statement of operations the foreign currency forward contracts were settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017  we received 365 million  from the settlement of these foreign currency forward contracts and recorded a net foreign exchange gain  included in other income expense net amounting to 365 million  for the fiscal year 2017  the cash flows related to the settlement of these foreign currency forward contracts are included in cash flows from investing activities within our consolidated statement of cash flows 

market risk 

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 60  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in natural hedges 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be positively but not proportionately impacted conversely when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be negatively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95  confidence interval and a holding period of 30  days as of december 31 2017  this computation estimated that there is a 5  chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 04 million  this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2017  the valueatrisk ranged between 01 million  and 07 million  with an average of approximately 04 million  

  

interest rate risk as of december 31 2017  we had 6250 million  outstanding borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and 2000 million  of outstanding borrowings under our senior unsecured term loan credit facility as described above in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” amounts drawn under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our senior unsecured term loan credit facility bear interest at variable rates our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 2021 million  at december 31 2017  fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

interest rate risk—sensitivity  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

i changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows to fluctuate an increase of 10  or approximately 26  basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 22 million  for fiscal year 2018  

  

ii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2017  the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2017  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2017 we implemented a plan that called for modifications and additions to our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for revenue as a result of the new revenue recognition standard the modified and new controls have been designed to address risks associated with recognizing revenue under the new standard and disclosures required before the standards effective date we have therefore augmented our internal control over financial reporting as follows 

 

• enhanced the risk assessment process to take into account risks associated with the new revenue standard 

 

there was no other change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2017 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in the 2013 internal controlintegrated framework our assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal controls of euroimmun acquired on december 18 2017  which is included in our 2017 consolidated financial statements and represented approximately 307  of our total assets as of december 31 2017  and 06  of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017  

based on this assessment our management concluded that as of december 31 2017  our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria

marketing 

all of our businesses market their products and services primarily through their own specialized sales forces as of january 1 2017  we employed approximately 3700  sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35  countries and marketing products and services in more than 150  countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials key components and supplies 

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with our suppliers for certain critical raw materials key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components see the applicable risk factor in “item 1a risk factors” for an additional description of this risk 

  

intellectual property 

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names 

and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties 

  

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required for a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

due to the range and diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors our competitors range from foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to more narrowly focused firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation operational efficiency product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market positions we expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

research and development 

research and development expenditures were 1243 million  during fiscal year 2016  1125 million  during fiscal year 2015  and 1081 million  during fiscal year 2014  

  

we have a broad product base and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs to accelerate our growth initiatives we directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014  primarily toward our diagnostics segment and the environmental food life sciences research and laboratory services markets within our discovery  analytical solutions segment we expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2017  and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics segment and the environmental food life sciences research and laboratory services markets within our discovery  analytical solutions segment 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing uses emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 99 million  and 118 million  as of january 1 2017  and january 3 2016  respectively which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not 

include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims during fiscal year 2014 we recorded a benefit of 23 million  for cost reimbursements related to a particular site of which 12 million  was for future monitoring and mitigation activities our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

as of january 1 2017  we employed approximately 8000  employees in our continuing operations several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of january 1 2017  we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately 1700  union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 

financial information about business segments 

the results reported for fiscal year 2016 reflect the new alignment of our operating segments and the placement of our medical imaging business into discontinued operations due to its pending sale financial information in the table below relating to fiscal years 2015 and 2014 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect both our new segment structure and the exclusion of our medical imaging business from continuing operations 

we have included the expenses for our corporate headquarters such as legal tax audit human resources information technology and other management and compliance costs as well as the activity related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans as “corporate” below we have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses these amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments 

  

the table below sets forth revenue and operating income loss from continuing operations by operating segment for the fiscal years ended 

  



 

 

discontinued operations have not been included in the preceding table 

additional information relating to our reporting segments is as follows for the fiscal years ended 

  



  



financial information about geographic areas 

both of our reporting segments conduct business in and derive substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during fiscal year 2016  we had 12732 million  in sales from our international operations representing approximately 60  of our total sales during fiscal year 2016  we derived approximately 75  of our international sales from our discovery  analytical solutions segment and approximately 25  of our international sales from our diagnostics segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future 

  

we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements additional geographic information is discussed in note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding restrictions in capital expenditures general economic conditions cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

our growth is subject to global economic and political conditions and operational disruptions at our facilities 

our business is affected by global economic and political conditions as well as the state of the financial markets particularly as the united states and other countries balance concerns around debt inflation growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives there can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows results of operations financial position or our ability to access capital such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the united states and internationally our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location 

while we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities a major earthquake fire flood power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments or other measures and some of these risks are insurable but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

 many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or divestitures license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our acquisition of bioo scientific in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons such as 

 some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition if for example we are unable to successfully commercialize products and services related to significant inprocess research and development that we have capitalized we may have to impair the value of such assets accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences loss of key personnel unforeseen 

regulatory requirements previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results additionally if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies which may adversely impact our profitability 

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies the expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs as a result small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 



 a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the united states postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals tantalum tin gold tungsten and their derivatives which may be contained in our products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as a result of these rules we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the 

components used in our products be certified as conflictfree and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs 

the manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies in the united states and abroad we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil criminal or monetary penalties 

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions some of our products are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

we are also subject to a variety of laws regulations and standards that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances and our business practices in the united states and abroad such as antibribery anticorruption and competition laws this requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws regulations and standards a failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2016  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 



 if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and scientists and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or inadvertent transfer of information or if we fail to implement new systems software and technologies successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to develop manufacture and provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems or inadvertent transfer of information could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

we have a substantial amount of outstanding debt which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business 

  

we have a substantial amount of debt and other financial obligations our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 



in addition we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility senior unsecured notes due in 2021 2021 notes and senior unsecured notes due in 2026 2026 notes include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company these include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

 we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments 

any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility the 2021 notes the 2026 notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances 

the approval of the brexit referendum in the uk may have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

in a referendum vote held on june 23 2016 the united kingdom voted to leave the european union nearly 3 of our net sales from continuing operations in 2016 came from the uk at this time we are not able to predict the impact that this vote will have on the economy in europe including in the uk or on the great britain pound the “gbp” or other european exchange rates weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm our business and if such conditions emerge in the uk or in the rest of europe it may have a material adverse effect on our sales in addition any significant weakening of the gbp to the us dollar will have an adverse impact on our european revenues due to the importance of uk sales 

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

as of january 1 2017  our total assets included 27 billion  of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights customer relationships core technology and technology licenses and inprocess research and development net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets 

adverse changes in our business adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units or the failure to grow our discovery  analytical solutions and diagnostics segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our share price will fluctuate 

over the last several years stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 

 dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

on october 26 2016  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2016  that was paid in february 2017  on january 27 2017  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the first  quarter of fiscal year 2017  that will be payable in may 2017  in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

overview of fiscal year 2016   

we realigned our businesses at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to better organize around customer requirements positioning us to grow in attractive end markets and expand share with our core product offerings we created two new reporting segments discovery  analytical solutions and diagnostics which will enable us to deliver improved customer focus more valueadd collaboration and breakthrough innovations microfluidics and automation products within our former research business were moved to a new applied genomics group within the diagnostics segment in addition we also moved our medical imaging business into discontinued operations due to its pending sale the results reported for fiscal year 2016  reflect our new segment structure and the exclusion of our medical imaging business from continuing operations financial information in this report relating to fiscal years 2015 and 2014  has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect these changes 

during fiscal year 2016  we continued to see good performance from acquisitions investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives our overall revenue in fiscal year 2016   increase d 107 million  or 1  as compared to fiscal year 2015  reflecting an increase  of 261 million  or 5  in our diagnostics segment revenue which was partially offset by a decrease  of 154 million  or 1  in our discovery  analytical solutions segment revenue the decrease  in our discovery  analytical solutions segment was primarily driven by decreases in revenue in our academic and government product offerings within our life sciences research market and a decrease in our environmental and food businesses due to weak harvest conditions which were partially offset by increased demand in our laboratory services business the increase  in our diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to strong performance of our newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in emerging markets such as china as well as in europe 

in our discovery  analytical solutions segment excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange we experienced flat growth during fiscal year 2016  in several of our products within our life science research end market as compared to fiscal year 2015  during fiscal year 2016 we experienced increased demand for our onesource laboratory service and informatics businesses our onesource laboratory service business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time while reducing maintenance costs all of which continue to be critical for them this was offset by decreases in revenue in our environmental and food business due to weak harvest conditions as well as in our academic and government product offerings due to reduced government funding we anticipate that the continued development of contaminant regulations and corresponding testing protocols will result in increased demand for efficient analytically sensitive and information rich testing solutions 

in our diagnostics segment we experienced growth from continued expansion in our newborn screening blood banking and screening businesses birth rates in the united states continue to stabilize and demand for greater access to newborn screening in rural areas outside the united states is also increasing as evidenced by prenatal trends we saw during fiscal year 2016  the growth in our diagnostics segment was partially offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency as the us dollar strengthened as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers we anticipate that the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease which can result in a reduction of longterm health care costs as well as create better outcomes for patients are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets 

our consolidated gross margins increase d 209  basis points in fiscal year 2016  as compared to fiscal year 2015  primarily due to favorable changes in product mix with an increase in sales of higher gross margin product offerings and benefits from our initiatives to improve our supply chain our consolidated operating margin increase d 146  basis points in fiscal year 2016  as compared to fiscal year 2015  primarily due to higher gross margins and lower costs as a result of cost containment and productivity initiatives which were partially offset by increased costs related to investments in new product development 

we continue to believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the spending trends in our end markets and to promote efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services overall we believe that our strategic focus on diagnostics and discovery and analytical solutions markets coupled with our deep portfolio of technologies and applications leading market positions global scale and financial strength will provide us with a foundation for growth

the variation in our effective tax rate for each year is primarily a result of the recognition of earnings in foreign jurisdictions predominantly singapore finland and china which are taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate resulting in a benefit from income taxes of 458 million  in fiscal year 2016  342 million  in fiscal year 2015  and 291 million  in fiscal year 2014  these amounts include 114 million  in fiscal year 2016  83 million  in fiscal year 2015  and 71 million  in fiscal year 2014  of benefits derived from tax holidays in china and singapore the effect of these benefits derived from tax holidays on basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2016  was 010  and 010  respectively for fiscal year 2015  was 007  and 007  respectively and for fiscal year 2014  was 006  and 006  respectively the tax holiday in china is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2017  and the tax holiday in singapore is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2018  

discontinued operations 

as part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have discontinued certain businesses when the discontinued operations represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations any business deemed to be a discontinued operation prior to the adoption of accounting standards update 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity asu 201408  continues to be reported as a discontinued operation and the results of operations and related cash flows are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented any remaining assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of january 1 2017  and january 3 2016  

in may 2014 our management approved the shutdown of our microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states which had been reported within our diagnostics segment we determined that with the lack of adequate reimbursement from health care payers the microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states would need significant investment in its operations to reduce costs in order to effectively compete in the market the shutdown of the microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states resulted in a 01 million  net pretax gain  primarily related to the disposal of fixed assets which was partially offset by the sale of a building in fiscal year 2014 

in august 1999 we sold the assets of our technical service business we recorded pretax losses of 18 million  in fiscal year 2016  003 million  in fiscal year 2015  and 02 million  in fiscal year 2014  for a contingency related to this business these losses were recognized as a loss on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes 

during fiscal year 2016  we settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations and recognized a pretax loss  of 11 million  this loss was recognized as a loss on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes 

during fiscal year 2016  we sold perkinelmer labs inc for cash consideration of 200 million  recognizing a pretax gain of 71 million  the sale generated a capital loss for tax purposes of 73 million  which resulted in an income tax benefit of 25 million  that was recognized as a discrete benefit during the second quarter of 2016 perkinelmer labs inc was a component of our diagnostics segment the pretax gain recognized in fiscal year 2016  is included in interest and other expense net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations the divestiture of perkinelmer labs inc has not been classified as a discontinued operation in this form 10k because the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements 

during fiscal year 2016  we entered into a letter of intent to contribute certain assets to an academic institution in the united kingdom we recognized a pretax loss of 16 million  related to the writeoff of assets in the second quarter of 2016 which is included in interest and other expense net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations 

in december 2016 we entered into a master purchase and sale agreement the “agreement” with varian medical systems inc the “purchaser” under which we agreed to sell to the purchaser all of the outstanding equity interests in our wholly owned indirect subsidiaries perkinelmer medical holdings inc and dexela limited together with certain assets relating to the business of designing manufacturing and marketing flat panel xray detectors and related software accessories and ancillary products to xray system manufacturers the “medical imaging business” for cash consideration of approximately 2760 million  and the purchaser’s assumption of specified liabilities relating to the medical imaging business collectively the “transaction” the medical imaging business has been reported in the diagnostics segment the agreement contemplates that the purchaser will finance the transaction through a debt financing and that except as determined otherwise by the purchaser the closing will occur no earlier than april 2017 however the closing of the transaction is not conditioned upon the receipt of any such financing the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including the expiration of specified antitrust waiting periods the agreement contains certain termination rights and provides that under specified circumstances upon termination of the agreement the purchaser will be required to pay us a termination fee of up to 221 million  the sale of the medical imaging business represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements accordingly we classified the assets and liabilities related to the medical imaging business as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheets and its results of operations are classified as income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 

the summary pretax operating results of the discontinued operations which include the periods prior to disposition and a 10 million  pretax restructuring charge related to workforce reductions in the microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states during fiscal year 2014 were as follows during the three fiscal years ended 



we recorded a tax provision  of 43 million  115 million  and 129 million  on discontinued operations and dispositions in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014  

business combinations 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2016 

during the fiscal year 2016  we completed the acquisition of two businesses for a total consideration of 722 million  in cash the acquired businesses were bioo scientific corporation which was acquired for total consideration of 635 million  in cash and one other business acquired for a total consideration of 88 million  in cash the excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of each of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforce acquired as a result of the acquisitions we recorded goodwill of 456 million  which is not tax deductible and intangible assets of 199 million  we reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our diagnostics and discovery  analytical solutions segments from the acquisition dates identifiable definitelived intangible assets such as core technology trade names and customer relationships acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of 95  years 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2015 

during fiscal year 2015 we completed the acquisition of five businesses for a total consideration of 771 million  in cash the acquired businesses included vanadis diagnostics ab vanadis which was acquired for total consideration of 351 million  in cash as further described in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and other acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of 420 million  in cash we have a potential obligation to pay the shareholders of vanadis additional contingent consideration of up to 930 million  which at closing had an estimated fair value of 569 million  the excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of each of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforce acquired and has been allocated to goodwill of which 92 million  is tax deductible we reported the operations for all of these acquisitions within the results of our diagnostics and discovery  analytical solutions segments from the acquisition dates 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2014 

acquisition of perten instruments group ab in december 2014 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of perten instruments group ab perten perten is a provider of analytical instruments and services for quality control of food grain flour and feed we expect this acquisition to enhance our industrial environmental and safety business by expanding our product offerings to the academic and industrial end markets we paid the shareholders of perten 2699 million  in cash for the stock of perten the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforce acquired and has been allocated to goodwill none of which is tax deductible we have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our discovery  analytical solutions segment from the acquisition date 

other acquisitions in fiscal year 2014 in addition to the perten acquisition we completed the acquisition of two businesses in fiscal year 2014 for total consideration of 176 million  in cash and 43 million  of assumed debt the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of each of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforce acquired and has been allocated to goodwill none  of which is tax deductible we reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our diagnostics and discovery  analytical solutions segments from the acquisition dates 

we do not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014  to be material to our consolidated results of operations therefore we are not presenting pro forma financial information of operations during fiscal years 2016 and 2015  we recognized 807 million  and 657 million  respectively of revenue for perten we have determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of the other acquisitions from the date of acquisition is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition 

as of january 1 2017  the allocations of purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2015 and 2014  were final the preliminary allocations of the purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016  were based upon initial valuations our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete our valuations within the measurement periods which are up to one year from the respective acquisition dates the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances and residual goodwill we expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition dates during the measurement periods during the measurement periods we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates 

that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of those dates with our adoption of accounting standards update no 201516 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments asu no 201516 during 2015 these adjustments will be made in the periods in which the amounts are determined and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition dates all changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement periods are also included in current period earnings 

during fiscal year 2016  we obtained information to assist in determining the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of our acquisitions and adjusted our purchase price allocations based on this information for acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2015 we recognized an increase in deferred taxes of 18 million  with a corresponding increase in goodwill 

allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period 

as of january 1 2017  we may have to pay contingent consideration related to acquisitions with open contingency periods of up to 846 million  as of january 1 2017  we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 632 million  of which 154 million  was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 478 million  was recorded in longterm liabilities as of january 3 2016  we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 574 million  of which 94 million  was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 480 million  was recorded in longterm liabilities the expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed 3  years from the respective acquisition dates and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at january 1 2017  was 175  years if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of definitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional contingent consideration which would be recognized as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations 

in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin thereon the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services we do not include any costs associated with selling effort research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs in most acquisitions profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition the sum of the costs and operating income approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a thirdparty to assume the obligation 

contingencies including tax matters 

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 99 million  and 118 million  as of january 1 2017  and january 3 2016  respectively in accrued expenses and other current liabilities which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims during fiscal year 2014 we recorded a benefit of 23 million  for cost reimbursements related to a particular site of which 12 million  was for future monitoring and mitigation activities our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation 

may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

various tax years after 2010  remain open to examination by certain jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such as finland germany italy netherlands singapore the united kingdom and the united states the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 

we are subject to various claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in our opinion based on our review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these contingencies at january 1 2017  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us 

reporting segment results of continuing operations 

beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we realigned our businesses to better position us to grow in attractive end markets and expand share with our core product offerings diagnostics became a standalone operating segment and we formed a new operating segment discovery  analytical solutions in addition we moved our medical imaging business into discontinued operations due to its pending sale the results reported for fiscal year 2016  reflect our new segment structure and the exclusion of our medical imaging business from continuing operations financial information in this report relating to fiscal years 2015 and 2014  has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect these changes

financing lease obligations in fiscal year 2012 we entered into agreements with the lessors of certain buildings that we are currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings we provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings and as a result we were considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period at the end of the construction period we were not reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs we are therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases qualify as financing leases under saleleaseback accounting guidance representing debt obligations for us and noncash investing and financing activities as a result we capitalized 293 million  in property plant and equipment net representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt we have also capitalized 115 million  in additional construction costs necessary to complete the renovations to the buildings which were funded by the lessors with a corresponding increase to debt at january 1 2017  we had 371 million  recorded for these financing lease obligations of which 12 million  was recorded as shortterm debt and 359 million  was recorded as longterm debt at january 3 2016  we had 382 million  recorded for these financing lease obligations of which 11 million  was recorded as shortterm debt and 371 million  was recorded as longterm debt the buildings are being depreciated on a straightline basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values which will equal the remaining financing obligation at the end of the lease term at the end of the lease term the remaining balances in property plant and equipment net and debt will be reversed against each other

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january 1 2017  for continuing and discontinued operations purchase commitments are minimal and have been excluded from this table 

  



 

   

as of january 1 2017  we may have to pay the shareholders of our acquisitions contingent consideration of up to 846 million  the table above does not reflect any of these obligations as the timing and amounts are uncertain for further information related to our contingent consideration obligations see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

capital expenditures 

during fiscal year 2017  we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2016  primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

at january 1 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of 3593 million  of which 3485 million  was held by our nonus subsidiaries and we had 9886 million  of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility we had no other liquid investments at january 1 2017  

  

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed of the 3485 million  of cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries at january 1 2017  we would incur us taxes on approximately 3225 million  if transferred to the us without proper planning we expect the accumulated nonus cash balances which may not be transferred to the us without incurring us taxes will remain outside of the us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows use of us cash balances external borrowings or some combination of these sources 

  

on october 23 2014 our board authorized us to repurchase up to 80 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program on july 27 2016 the board authorized us to immediately terminate the repurchase program and further authorized us to repurchase up to 80 million  shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program the new repurchase program the new repurchase program will expire on july 26 2018 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during the fiscal year 2016  we 

repurchased 32 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 1482 million  including commissions under the repurchase program no shares remain available for repurchase under the repurchase program due to its cancellation as of january 1 2017  80 million  shares remained available for repurchase under the new repurchase program 

in addition our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans during fiscal year 2016  we repurchased 75198  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 36 million  

the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the new repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability creating increased volatility in security prices widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets with respect to plans outside of the united states we expect to contribute 76 million  in the aggregate during fiscal year 2017 during fiscal year 2016  we contributed 96 million  in the aggregate to pension plans outside of the united states we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans during fiscal year 2015 we made contributions of 149 million  in the aggregate to plans outside of the united states and 200 million  to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states during fiscal year 2014 we contributed 112 million  in the aggregate to plans outside of the united states we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asu 201409 under this new guidance an entity should use a fivestep process to recognize revenue depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard also requires new disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers subsequent to the issuance of the standard the fasb decided to defer the effective date for one year to annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 in may 2016 the fasb also issued accounting standards update no 201612  revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 narrowscope improvements and practical expedients asu 201612  which amended its revenue recognition guidance in asu 201409 on transition collectibility noncash consideration contract modifications and completed contracts at transition and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes collected from customers in april 2016 the fasb also issued accounting standards update no 201610  revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 identifying performance obligations and 

licensing asu 201610  which amended its revenue recognition guidance in asu 201409 on identifying performance obligations to allow entities to disregard items that are immaterial in the context of the contract clarify when a promised good or service is separately identifiable ie distinct within the context of the contract and allow an entity to elect to account for the cost of shipping and handling performed after control of a good has been transferred to the customer as a fulfillment cost ie an expense asu 201610 also clarifies how an entity should evaluate the nature of its promise in granting a license of intellectual property ip and requires entities to classify ip in one of two categories functional ip or symbolic ip which will determine whether it recognizes revenue over time or at a point in time asu 201610 also address how entities should consider license renewals and restrictions and apply the exception for sales and usagebased royalties received in exchange for licenses of ip in march 2016 the fasb also issued accounting standards update no 201608 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net asu 201608 which amended the principalversusagent implementation guidance and illustrations in asu 201409 asu 201608 clarifies that an entity should evaluate when it is the principal or agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer asu 201612 asu 201610 asu 201608 and asu 201409 may be adopted either using a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach we are evaluating the requirements of the foregoing standards and have not yet determined the impact of their adoption on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows we intend to adopt these standards using the modified retrospective approach and we do not intend to early adopt these standards while we are currently evaluating the impact of the new revenue standard we believe the key changes in the standard that impact revenue recognition relate to the accounting for certain transactions with multiple elements or “bundled” arrangements for example sales of software subscriptions for which we do not have vsoe for maintenance andor support because the requirement to have vsoe for undelivered elements under current accounting standards is eliminated under the new standard accordingly we may be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software as compared to the current requirement of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over the maintenance period 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition warranty costs bad debts inventories accounting for business combinations and dispositions longlived assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for products that include installation and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete for revenue that includes customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue after the acceptance criteria have been met certain of our products require specialized installation revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as services are rendered 

in limited circumstances we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component including cord blood processing and storage for these arrangements the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a sellingprice hierarchy a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis a delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting the selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe if such evidence is available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and managements best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available tpe is the price of our or any competitors largely interchangeable products or services in standalone sales to similarlysituated customers besp is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis considering market conditions and entityspecific factors 

  

revenue from software licenses and services was 5  of our total revenue for each of fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014  we sell our software licenses with maintenance services and in some cases also with consulting services for the undelivered elements we determine vsoe of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately we determine vsoe for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the stated renewal rate method we determine vsoe for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements on a standalone basis 

  

we recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance andor consulting services upon shipment using the residual method provided that the above criteria have been met if vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered or if the only undelivered element is maintenance then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period 

  

the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings accounts are writtenoff only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted 

  

inventory valuation we value inventory at the lower of cost or market inventories are accounted for using the firstin firstout method we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest inprocess research and development “iprd” is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period 

value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest 

that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using measurement dates of january 4 2016  and january 1 2015  and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment at january 4 2016  the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 200  for each reporting unit at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we realigned our organization into two new operating segments in conjunction with the realignment of our operating segments we also redefined our reporting units based on our operating segments we determined that the reporting units that should be used to test goodwill for impairment are environmental health excluding food food life sciences and technology informatics onesource diagnostics excluding cord blood cord blood and medical imaging as a result of the realignment we reallocated goodwill from our life sciences and technology reporting unit to our diagnostics excluding cord blood reporting unit based on the relative fair value determined using the income approach of the applied genomics business which resulted in 1258 million  of goodwill being reallocated from our life sciences and technology reporting unit to our diagnostics excluding food reporting unit as of october 3 2016 as of january 2 2017 our informatics reporting unit which had a goodwill balance of 2110 million  had a fair value that was less than 20 but greater than 10 more than its carrying value informatics is at increased risk of an impairment charge given its ongoing weakness due to a highly competitive industry despite the increased risk associated with this reporting unit we do not believe there will be a significant change in the key estimates or assumptions driving the fair value of this reporting unit that would lead to a material impairment charge while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future 

nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the nonamortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a nonamortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible asset at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of our nonamortizing intangible asset is no longer indefinite the asset will be tested for impairment this intangible asset will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 

employee compensation and benefits we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar monthend that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement 

we recognized a loss  of 145 million  in fiscal year 2016  a loss  of 94 million  in fiscal year 2015  and a loss  of 772 million  in fiscal year 2014  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans which includes the charge for the marktomarket adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans which was recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the loss or income related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans was a pretax loss  of 153 million  in fiscal year 2016  a pretax loss  of 124 million  in fiscal year 2015  and pretax loss  of 754 million  in fiscal year 2014  we expect income of approximately 45 million  in fiscal year 2017  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans excluding the charge for or benefit from the marktomarket adjustment it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a marktomarket adjustment in fiscal year 2017  marktomarket adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control including changes in interest rates the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease markto market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2017  conversely to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected markto market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2017  pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year beginning in 

fiscal year 2016 the approach we use to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for certain nonus benefit plans was changed to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs prior to fiscal year 2016 we calculated these service and interest components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in fiscal year 2016 we have elected to utilize an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period 

as of january 1 2017  we estimate the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 725  and to be 600  for all plans outside the united states in addition as of january 1 2017  we estimate the discount rate for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 405  and to be 206  for all plans outside the united states for the plans in the united states we adopted the updated projection scale mp2015 that was published by the society of actuaries in 2015 as of january 3 2016 the adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a 68 million  decrease to the projected benefit obligation as of january 3 2016 during fiscal year 2016 the society of actuaries issued an updated projection scale mp2016 which reduced the life expectancy used to determine the projected benefit obligation we adopted mp2016 as of january 1 2017 the adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a 55 million  decrease to the projected benefit obligation at january 1 2017 we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date 

if any of our assumptions were to change as of january 1 2017  our pension plan expenses would also change 



we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and contractual agreements ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and iii impairment of assets as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled “restructuring and contract termination charges net” 

dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation which meets the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the fiscal year ended january 1 2017  pretax gain s from the disposition of discontinued operations was not material any such changes decrease or increase current earnings 

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine our current tax provision as well as enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled to determine our deferred tax provision any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

additionally we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards state income tax credit carryforwards and certain foreign tax attributes valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision 

taxes have not been provided on unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries that we consider indefinitely reinvested because we plan to keep these amounts indefinitely reinvested overseas except for instances where we can remit such earnings to the us without an associated net tax cost our indefinite reinvestment determination is based on the future operational and capital requirements of our us and nonus operations as of january 1 2017  the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the us indefinitely and for which no us tax cost has been provided was approximately 11 billion  it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments derivatives marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january 1 2017  

  

we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments by nature all financial instruments involve market and credit risks we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use 

leveraged financial instruments approximately 60  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can increase the costs of financing investing and operating the business 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12  months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 

  

principal hedged currencies include the british pound euro japanese yen and singapore dollar we held forward foreign exchange contracts designated as economic hedges with us dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling 1375 million  at january 1 2017  1273 million  at january 3 2016  and 950 million  at december 28 2014  and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material the duration of these contracts was generally 30  days or less during each of fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014  

in addition in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance our acquisitions and stock repurchase program we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies we record these hedges at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on these hedges as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 

as of january 1 2017  the outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges that were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements included combined euro notional amounts of €586 million  combined us dollar notional amounts of 87 million  and combined swedish krona notional amounts of kr9695 million  the combined euro notional amounts of these outstanding hedges was €1074 million  and €2382 million  as of january 3 2016  and december 28 2014  respectively the net gains and losses on these derivatives combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material for the fiscal years ended january 1 2017  and january 3 2016  we paid 19 million  and received 187 million  during the fiscal years ended january 1 2017  and january 3 2016  respectively from the settlement of these hedges 

during fiscal year 2016  we entered into a series of foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of €4923 million to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges were included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci which offsets the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries the cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold the foreign currency forward contracts were settled during fiscal year 2016  and we recorded a net realized foreign exchange gain in aoci amounting to 18 million during the fiscal year 2016  

during fiscal year 2016 in connection with the issuance of the 2026 notes we designated the 2026 notes to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges will be included in the foreign currency translation component of aoci which will offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries the cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold as of january 1 2017  the total notional amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was €4958 million  the unrealized foreign exchange loss recorded in aoci related to the net investment hedge was 238 million  during the fiscal year 2016  

market risk 

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 60  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in natural hedges 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be positively but not proportionately impacted conversely when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be negatively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95  confidence interval and a holding period of 30  days as of january 1 2017  this computation estimated that there is a 5  chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 03 million  this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2016  the valueatrisk ranged between 01 million  and 06 million  with an average of approximately 03 million  

  

interest rate risk as of january 1 2017  we had no outstanding borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility however as described above in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” amounts drawn under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility would bear interest at variable rates our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 3593 million  at january 1 2017  fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

interest rate risk—sensitivity  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

i changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows to fluctuate an increase of 10  or approximately 17  basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 01 million  for fiscal year 2017  

  

ii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of january 1 2017  the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of january 1 2017  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

recent developments 

as part of our strategy to grow our core businesses we have recently taken the following actions 

strategic business realignment 

we realigned our organization at the beginning of fiscal year 2015 to enable us to both deliver complete solutions targeted towards certain end markets and develop valueadded applications and solutions to foster further expansion of those markets onesource our multivendor laboratory service business that serves the life sciences end market was moved from our environmental health segment into our human health segment the results reported for fiscal year 2015  reflect this new alignment of our operating segments financial information in this report relating to fiscal years 2014 and 2013  has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change to our operating segments 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2015 

we completed the acquisition of five businesses in fiscal year 2015  for a total consideration of 771 million  in cash the acquired businesses included vanadis diagnostics ab “vanadis” which was acquired for total consideration of 351 million  in cash as further described in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and other acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of 420 million  in cash we have a potential obligation to pay the shareholders of vanadis additional contingent consideration of up to 930 million  which at closing had an estimated fair value of 569 million  we reported the operations for all of these acquisitions within the results of our human health and environmental health segments from the acquisition dates 

restructuring 

during fiscal year 2015  we recorded pretax restructuring charges of 44 million  in our human health segment and 132 million  in our environmental health segment related to a workforce reduction from restructuring activities our 

management approved these plans principally to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives and to focus resources on higher growth end markets we also recorded pretax restructuring reversals of 23 million  in our human health segment and 39 million  in our environmental health segment related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in fiscal year 2015  we also recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 20 million  in our human health segment relating to the closure of excess facility space and a pretax restructuring charge of 01 million  in our environmental health segment primarily as a result of terminating various contractual commitments this pretax restructuring activity has been reported as restructuring and contract termination charges and is included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect no  significant impact on future operating results or cash flows from the restructuring activities executed in fiscal year 2015  

as part of our ongoing business strategy we also took the following actions 

share repurchase program   

on october 23 2014 our board of directors our board authorized us to repurchase up to 80 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program the repurchase program will expire on october 23 2016 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2015  we repurchased 15 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 720 million  including commissions under the repurchase program as of january 3 2016  59 million  shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program from january 4 2016 through february 25 2016  we repurchased 24 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 1097 million  including commissions under the repurchase program 

business segments and products 

we report our business in two segments human health and environmental health we performed our annual impairment testing on january 1 2015  the annual impairment date for our reporting units and based on the first step of the impairment process the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment 

we realigned our organization at the beginning of fiscal year 2015 to enable us to both deliver complete solutions targeted towards certain end markets and develop valueadded applications and solutions to foster further expansion of those markets onesource our multivendor laboratory service business that serves the life sciences end market was moved from our environmental health segment into our human health segment the results reported for fiscal year 2015  reflect this new alignment of our operating segments financial information in this report relating to fiscal years 2014 and 2013  has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change to our operating segments

marketing 

all of our businesses market their products and services primarily through their own specialized sales forces as of january 3 2016  we employed approximately 3700  sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35  countries and marketing products and services in more than 150  countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials key components and supplies 

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with our suppliers for certain critical raw materials key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components see the applicable risk factor in “item 1a risk factors” for an additional description of this risk 

  

intellectual property 

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties 

  

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required for a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

due to the range and diversity of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors our competitors range from foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to more narrowly focused firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation operational efficiency product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market positions we expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

research and development 

research and development expenditures were 1259 million  during fiscal year 2015  1211 million  during fiscal year 2014  and 1324 million  during fiscal year 2013  

  

we have a broad product base and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs we directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013  primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental industrial and laboratory service markets within our environmental health segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives we expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2016  and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental industrial and laboratory services markets within our environmental health segment 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing uses emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 118 million  and 123 million  as of january 3 2016  and december 28 2014  respectively which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims during fiscal year 2014 we recorded a benefit of 23 million  for cost reimbursements related to a particular site of which 12 million  was for future monitoring and mitigation activities during fiscal year 2013 we accrued an additional 57 million  related to a particular site for increased monitoring and mitigation activities of which 46 million  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

as of january 3 2016  we employed approximately 8000  employees in our continuing operations several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of january 3 2016  we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately 1600  union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 

financial information about business segments 

we realigned our organization at the beginning of fiscal year 2015 to enable us to both deliver complete solutions targeted towards certain end markets and develop valueadded applications and solutions to foster further expansion of those markets onesource our multivendor laboratory service business that serves the life sciences end market was moved from our environmental health segment into our human health segment the results reported for fiscal year 2015  reflect this new alignment of our operating segments financial information in this report relating to fiscal years 2014 and 2013  has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change to our operating segments 

we have included the expenses for our corporate headquarters such as legal tax audit human resources information technology and other management and compliance costs as well as the activity related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans as “corporate” below we have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses these amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments

financial information about geographic areas 

both of our reporting segments conduct business in and derive substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during fiscal year 2015  we had 13460 million  in sales from our international operations representing approximately 60  of our total sales during fiscal year 2015  we derived approximately 50  of our international sales from our human health segment and approximately 50  of our international sales from our environmental health segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future 

  

we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements additional geographic information is discussed in note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding restrictions in capital expenditures general economic conditions cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

our growth is subject to global economic and political conditions and operational disruptions at our facilities 

our business is affected by global economic conditions and the state of the financial markets particularly as the united states and other countries balance concerns around debt inflation growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives there can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows results of operations financial position or our ability to access capital such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the united states and internationally our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location 

while we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities a major earthquake fire flood power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations 

could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments or other measures and some of these risks are insurable but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

 many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable or successfully divest businesses 

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our acquisition of perten instruments group ab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons such as 

 some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition if for example we are unable to successfully commercialize products and services related to significant iprd that we have capitalized we may have to impair the value of such assets accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences loss of key personnel unforeseen regulatory requirements previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results additionally if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the 

expected benefits of such divestitures as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies which may adversely impact our profitability 

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies the expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs as a result small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

 14 

 a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the united states postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals tantalum tin gold tungsten and their derivatives which may be contained in our products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as a result of these rules we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the components used in our products be certified as conflictfree and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs 

the manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies in the united states and abroad we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil criminal or monetary penalties 

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions some of the products produced by our human health segment are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

we are also subject to a variety of laws regulations and standards that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances and our business practices in the united states and abroad such as antibribery anticorruption and competition laws this requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws regulations and standards a failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2015  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 16 

 if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and scientists and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or inadvertent transfer of information or if we fail to implement new systems software and technologies successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to develop manufacture and provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems or inadvertent transfer of information could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

we have a substantial amount of outstanding debt which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business 

our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 in addition we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 5 senior unsecured notes due in 2021 the 2021 notes include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company these include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

 we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments 

any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility our 2021 notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances 

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

as of january 3 2016  our total assets included 28 billion  of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights customer relationships core technology and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets 

adverse changes in our business adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units or the failure to grow our human health and environmental health segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our share price will fluctuate 

over the last several years stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 

 dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

on october 29 2015  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2015  that was paid in february 2016  on january 28 2016  we announced that our board had declared a 

quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the first  quarter of fiscal year 2016  that will be payable in may 2016  in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

overview of fiscal year 2015   

we realigned our organization at the beginning of fiscal year 2015 to enable us to both deliver complete solutions targeted towards certain end markets and develop valueadded applications and solutions to foster further expansion of those markets onesource our multivendor laboratory service business that serves the life sciences end market was moved from our environmental health segment into our human health segment the results reported for fiscal year 2015  reflect this new alignment of our operating segments financial information in this report relating to fiscal years 2014 and 2013  has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change to our operating segments 

as a result of the realignment we reallocated goodwill from our environmental health segment to our human health segment based on the relative fair value determined using the income approach of the onesource business within the historical environmental health segment the realignment resulted in 412 million  of goodwill being reallocated from our environmental health segment to our human health segment as of december 28 2014 

during fiscal year 2015  we continued to see good performance from acquisitions investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives our overall revenue in fiscal year 2015   increase d 251 million  or 1  as compared to fiscal year 2014  reflecting an increase  of 327 million  or 4  in our environmental health segment revenue which was partially offset by a decrease  of 76 million  or 1  in our human health segment revenue the increase  in our environmental health segment revenue during fiscal year 2015  was primarily due to revenue from our acquisition of perten instruments group ab perten in december 2014 as well as increased demand in our laboratory services business which was partially offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency during fiscal year 2015  our human health segment revenue decreased due to unfavorable impacts from foreign currency however we experienced increased demand for our onesource laboratory service and informatics businesses within our research market as well as increased demand in our newborn and infectious disease screening business within our diagnostics market in addition new product introductions within our research market such as the opera phenix increased revenue in our human health segment 

in our human health segment excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange we experienced growth during fiscal year 2015  in several of our products within both our research and diagnostics end markets as compared to fiscal year 2014  in our research market we experienced increased demand for our onesource laboratory service and informatics businesses as well as an increase in revenue from new product introductions such as the opera phenix our onesource laboratory service business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time while reducing maintenance costs all of which continue to be critical for them in our diagnostics market we continued to expand our newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in emerging markets such as china birth rates in the united states continue to stabilize and demand for greater access to newborn screening in rural areas outside the united states is also increasing as evidenced by prenatal trends we saw during fiscal year 2015  our medical imaging business experienced slight growth due to increased demand for our cmos and cassette panels which was partially offset by a decrease in demand in our radiography and radiation oncology end markets the growth in our human health segment was more than offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency as the us dollar strengthened particularly versus the euro as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers we anticipate that the benefits of providing earlier 

detection of disease which can result in a reduction of longterm health care costs as well as create better outcomes for patients are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets 

in our environmental health segment we had an increase in revenue in fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  despite unfavorable impacts from foreign currency the increase in revenue was primarily due to revenue from our acquisition of perten in december 2014 as well as growth in our materials characterization product family within our environmental and industrial markets which was partially offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency in addition we had an increased demand in our laboratory services business despite unfavorable impacts from foreign currency we anticipate that the continued development of contaminant regulations and corresponding testing protocols will result in increased demand for efficient analytically sensitive and information rich testing solutions 

our consolidated gross margins increase d 38  basis points in fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  due to increased sales volume benefits from initiatives to improve our supply chain as well as a lower marktomarket loss  for our postretirement benefit plans in fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  these items were partially offset by unfavorable changes in product mix with an increase in sales of lower gross margin product offerings and negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rates our consolidated operating margin increase d 323  basis points in fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  primarily due to a pretax loss  of 124 million  in fiscal year 2015  as compared to a pretax loss  of 759 million  in fiscal year 2014  for the marktomarket adjustments for our postretirement plans higher gross margins and lower costs as a result of cost containment and productivity initiatives which were partially offset by increased costs related to investments in new product development 

we believe we continue to be well positioned to take advantage of the spending trends in our end markets and to promote efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services overall we believe that our strategic focus on human health and environmental health coupled with our deep portfolio of technologies and applications leading market positions global scale and financial strength will provide us with a solid foundation for growth

2014  compared to 2013  cost of revenue for fiscal year 2014  was 12326 million  as compared to 11814 million  for fiscal year 2013  an increase  of approximately 512 million  or 4  as a percentage of revenue cost of revenue increase d to 551  in fiscal year 2014  from 548  in fiscal year 2013  resulting in a decrease  in gross margin of approximately 34  basis points to 449  in fiscal year 2014  from 452  in fiscal year 2013  amortization of intangible assets decrease d and was 497 million  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to 520 million  for fiscal year 2013  the marktomarket adjustment for postretirement benefit plans was a loss  of 84 million  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to a loss  of 08 million  for fiscal year 2013  stockbased compensation expense was 15 million  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to 13 million  for fiscal year 2013  the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions was 24 million  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to 02 million  for fiscal year 2013  acquisition related costs for integration contingent consideration and other costs added an incremental expense of 01 million  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to 02 million  for fiscal year 2013  in addition to the factors noted above the decrease  in gross margin was primarily the result of unfavorable changes in product mix with an increase in sales of lower gross margin product offerings pricing pressure and negative impacts from foreign exchange rates these items were partially offset by increased sales volume and lower costs as a result of cost containment and productivity initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses 

2015  compared to 2014  selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2015  were 5988 million  as compared to 6593 million  for fiscal year 2014  a decrease  of approximately 605 million  or 9  as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses decrease d and were 265  in fiscal year 2015  compared to 295  in fiscal year 2014  amortization of intangible assets increase d and was 346 million  for fiscal year 2015  as compared to 331 million  for fiscal year 2014  the marktomarket adjustment for postretirement benefit plans was a loss  of 111 million  for fiscal year 2015  as compared to a loss  of 671 million  for fiscal year 2014  stockbased compensation expense increase d and was 158 million  for fiscal year 2015  as compared to 125 million  for fiscal year 2014  during fiscal year 2015  we recorded 08 million  in legal costs for a particular case during fiscal year 2014  we recorded a benefit of 23 million  for cost reimbursements related to a particular site of which 12 million  was for future monitoring and mitigation activities acquisition related costs for integration contingent consideration and other costs added an incremental expense of 08 million  for fiscal year 2015  and 04 million  for fiscal year 2014  in addition to the above items the decrease  in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of lower costs as a result of cost containment and productivity initiatives which was partially offset by the impact from foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of an additional week during fiscal year 2015 the effect of foreign currency changes from prior year period on selling general and administrative expense is approximately 316 million in fiscal year 2015 

2014  compared to 2013  selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2014  were 6593 million  as compared to 5819 million  for fiscal year 2013  an increase  of approximately 774 million  or 13  as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses increase d and were 295  in fiscal year 2014  compared to 270  in fiscal year 2013  amortization of intangible assets decrease d and was 331 million  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to 369 million  for fiscal year 2013  the marktomarket adjustment for postretirement benefit plans was a loss  of 671 million  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to income  of 181 million  for fiscal year 2013  stockbased compensation expense increase d and was 125 million  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to 119 million  for fiscal year 2013  during fiscal year 2014  we recorded a benefit of 23 million  for cost reimbursements related to a particular site of which 12 million  was for future monitoring and mitigation activities as compared to expense of 46 million  for environmental costs for fiscal year 2013  acquisition related costs for integration contingent consideration and other costs added an incremental expense of 04 million  for fiscal year 2014  and 11 million  for fiscal year 2013  in addition to the above items the increase  in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of costs related to growth investments particularly in emerging territories partially offset by lower costs as a result of cost containment and productivity initiatives 

  

research and development expenses 

2015  compared to 2014  research and development expenses for fiscal year 2015  were 1259 million  as compared to 1211 million  for fiscal year 2014  an increase  of 48 million  or 4  as a percentage of revenue research and development expenses increase d to 56  in fiscal year 2015  as compared to 54  in fiscal year 2014  amortization of intangible assets decrease d and was 05 million  for fiscal year 2015  as compared to 06 million  for fiscal year 2014  the marktomarket adjustment for postretirement benefit plans was a loss  of 01 million  for fiscal year 2015  as compared to a loss  of 04 million  for fiscal year 2014  stockbased compensation expense increase d and was 06 million  for fiscal year 2015  as compared to 05 million  for fiscal year 2014  in addition to the above items the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to investments in new product development the impact from foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of an additional week in fiscal year 2015 we directed research and development efforts similarly during fiscal years 2015 and 2014  primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental industrial and laboratory services markets within our environmental health segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives the effect of foreign currency changes from prior year period on research and development expenses is approximately 86 million in fiscal year 2015 we have a broad product base and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs 

2014  compared to 2013  research and development expenses for fiscal year 2014  were 1211 million  as compared to 1324 million  for fiscal year 2013  a decrease  of 113 million  or 9  as a percentage of revenue research and development expenses decrease d to 54  in fiscal year 2014  as compared to 61  in fiscal year 2013  amortization of intangible assets increase d and was 06 million  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to 03 million  for fiscal year 2013  the marktomarket adjustment for postretirement benefit plans was a loss  of 04 million  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to income  of 03 million  for fiscal year 2013  stockbased compensation expense decrease d and was 05 million  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to 09 million  for fiscal year 2013  acquisition related costs added an incremental expense of 02 million  for fiscal year 2013  in addition to the above items the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily the result of the consolidation of research and development activities into our newly opened center for innovation we directed research and development efforts similarly during fiscal years 2014 and 2013  primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental industrial and laboratory services markets within our environmental health segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives 

restructuring and contract termination charges net 

we have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures the alignment of our operations with our growth strategy the integration of our business units and productivity initiatives restructuring and contract termination charges for fiscal year 2015  were 136 million  as compared to 134 million  for fiscal year 2014  and 339 million  for fiscal year 2013  

we implemented restructuring plans in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 the second and first quarters of fiscal year 2014 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 consisting of workforce reductions and the closure of excess facility space principally intended to focus resources on higher growth end markets the q4 2015 plan q2 2014 plan q1 2014 plan and q1 2013 plan respectively we implemented restructuring plans in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives the q2 2015 plan and q3 2014 plan respectively we implemented restructuring plans in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal year 2013 consisting of workforce reductions and the closure of excess facility space principally intended to shift certain of our research and development resources into our newly opened center for innovation the q4 2013 plan and q3 2013 plan respectively we implemented a restructuring plan in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 consisting of workforce reductions and the closure of excess facility space principally intended to shift certain of our operations into a newly established shared service center as well as realign operations research and development resources and production resources as a result of previous acquisitions the q2 2013 plan all other previous restructuring plans were workforce reductions or the closure of excess facility space principally intended to integrate our businesses in order to realign operations reduce costs achieve operational efficiencies and shift resources into geographic regions and end markets that are more consistent with our growth strategy the previous plans we expect no  significant impact on future operating results or cash flows from the restructuring activities executed in fiscal year 2015  

the following table summarizes the number of employees reduced the initial restructuring or contract termination charges by operating segment and the dates by which payments were substantially completed or the expected dates by which payments will be substantially completed for restructuring actions implemented during fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013  



 

 

we expect to make payments under the previous plans for remaining residual lease obligations with terms varying in length through fiscal year 2022  

we also have terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges to the extent applicable for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us we recorded additional pretax charges of 01 million  15 million  and 07 million  in our environmental health segment during fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013  respectively as a result of these contract terminations 

at january 3 2016  we had 222 million  recorded for accrued restructuring and contract termination charges of which 171 million  was recorded in shortterm accrued restructuring and 51 million  was recorded in longterm liabilities at december 28 2014  we had 238 million  recorded for accrued restructuring and contract termination charges of which 171 million  was recorded in shortterm accrued restructuring and 67 million  was recorded in longterm liabilities the following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan as well as contract termination accrual balances and related activity during fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013  



 

 

impairment of assets

2014  compared to 2013  impairment of assets was zero  in fiscal year 2014  as compared to 02 million  in fiscal year 2013  the fiscal year 2013 pretax impairment charge was 02 million  for the impairment of certain longlived assets within our human health segment as the carrying amounts of the longlived assets were not recoverable and exceeded their fair value additional information regarding impairment of assets is discussed in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

interest and other expense net 

interest and other expense net consisted of the following 



2015  compared to 2014  interest and other expense net for fiscal year 2015  was an expense  of 421 million  as compared to an expense  of 411 million  for fiscal year 2014  an increase  of 10 million  the increase  in interest and other expense net in fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  was primarily due to an increase in interest expense interest expense increase d by 17 million  in fiscal year 2015  as compared to fiscal year 2014  primarily due to increased debt outstanding on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and higher variable interest rates as well as an additional week during fiscal year 2015  other expenses for fiscal year 2015   decrease d by 07 million  as compared to fiscal year 2014  primarily due to expenses related to foreign currency transactions and translation of nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

2014  compared to 2013  interest and other expense net for fiscal year 2014  was an expense  of 411 million  as compared to an expense  of 641 million  for fiscal year 2013  a decrease  of 230 million  the decrease  in interest and other expense net in fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense interest expense decrease d by 137 million  in fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  primarily due to the redemption of our fixed rate 2015 notes in fiscal year 2013 resulting in lower debt outstanding and an increased mix of variable rate debt with lower interest rates during fiscal year 2014 in addition during fiscal year 2013 we wroteoff 28 million  for the remaining unamortized derivative losses for previously settled cash flow hedges and wroteoff 02 million  for the remaining deferred debt issuance costs related to the prepayment of our 2015 notes other expenses for fiscal year 2014   decrease d by 93 million  as compared to fiscal year 2013  primarily due to a prepayment premium of 111 million  for the redemption of our 2015 notes in fiscal year 2013 which was partially offset by expenses related to foreign currency transactions and translation of nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 

provision for benefit from income taxes 

2015  compared to 2014  the fiscal year 2015  provision for income taxes on continuing operations was 313 million  as compared to 84 million  for fiscal year 2014  the effective tax rate on continuing operations was 128  for fiscal year 2015  as compared to 50  for fiscal year 2014  the higher  provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2015  was primarily due to higher income in higher tax rate jurisdictions as compared to fiscal year 2014  

2014  compared to 2013  the fiscal year 2014  provision for income taxes on continuing operations was 84 million  as compared to a benefit of 106 million  for fiscal year 2013  the effective tax rate on continuing operations was a provision of 50  for fiscal year 2014  as compared to a benefit of 65  for fiscal year 2013  the provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2014  was primarily due to income in lower tax rate jurisdictions partially offset by losses in higher rate jurisdictions and a tax benefit of 70 million  related to discrete items the benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2013  was primarily due to a tax benefit of 240 million  related to discrete items and losses in higher tax rate jurisdictions partially offset by a provision from income taxes related to profits in lower tax rate jurisdictions the 240 million  of discrete items includes 94 million  for lapses in statutes of limitations during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 and 92 million  primarily for lapses in statutes of limitations and audit settlements in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 

discontinued operations 

as part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have discontinued certain businesses we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented any remaining assets and liabilities of these businesses 

have been presented separately and are reflected within assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of january 3 2016  and december 28 2014  

in may 2014 our management approved the shutdown of our microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states which had been reported within our human health segment we determined that with the lack of adequate reimbursement from health care payers the microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states would need significant investment in its operations to reduce costs in order to effectively compete in the market the shutdown of the microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states resulted in a 01 million  net pretax loss  primarily related to the disposal of fixed assets which was partially offset by the sale of a building in fiscal year 2014 

in august 1999 we sold the assets of our technical service business we recorded pretax losses of 003 million  in fiscal year 2015  02 million  in fiscal year 2014  and 21 million  in fiscal year 2013  for a contingency related to this business these losses were recognized as a loss on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes 

during fiscal year 2013 we settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations and recognized a pretax gain  of 03 million  this gain was recognized as a gain on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes 

summary pretax operating results of the discontinued operations which include the periods prior to disposition and a 10 million  pretax restructuring charge related to workforce reductions in the microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states during fiscal year 2014 were as follows during the three fiscal years ended 



we recorded a tax provision  of 02 million  on discontinued operations and dispositions in fiscal year 2015  a tax benefit  of 18 million  on discontinued operations and dispositions in fiscal year 2014  and a tax benefit  of 51 million  on discontinued operations and dispositions in fiscal year 2013  

business combinations 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2015 

during fiscal year 2015 we completed the acquisition of five businesses for a total consideration of 771 million  in cash the acquired businesses included vanadis which was acquired for total consideration of 351 million  in cash as further described in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and other acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of 420 million  in cash we have a potential obligation to pay the shareholders of vanadis additional contingent consideration of up to 930 million  which at closing had an estimated fair value of 569 million  the excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of each of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforce acquired and has been allocated to goodwill of which 92 million  is tax deductible we reported the operations for all of these acquisitions within the results of our human health and environmental health segments from the acquisition dates 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2014 

acquisition of perten instruments group ab in december 2014 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of perten perten is a provider of analytical instruments and services for quality control of food grain flour and feed we expect this acquisition to enhance our industrial environmental and safety business by expanding our product offerings to the academic and industrial end markets we paid the shareholders of perten 2699 million  in cash for the stock of perten the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforce acquired and has been allocated to goodwill none of which is tax deductible we have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our environmental health segment from the acquisition date 

other acquisitions in fiscal year 2014 in addition to the perten acquisition we completed the acquisition of two businesses in fiscal year 2014 for total consideration of 176 million  in cash and 43 million  of assumed debt the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of each of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforce acquired and has been allocated 

to goodwill none  of which is tax deductible we reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our human health and environmental health segments from the acquisition dates 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2013 

during fiscal year 2013 we completed the acquisition of four businesses for total consideration of 114 million  in cash as of the closing dates we potentially had to pay additional contingent consideration for the four acquired businesses of up to 22 million  which at closing had an estimated fair value of 11 million  during fiscal year 2014 we paid 04 million  in additional deferred consideration for one of these acquisitions the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of each of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforce acquired and has been allocated to goodwill none of which is tax deductible we reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our human health and environmental health segments from the acquisition dates 

we do not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013  to be material to our consolidated results of operations therefore we are not presenting pro forma financial information of operations during fiscal year 2015  we recognized 657 million  of revenue for perten we have determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of the other acquisitions from the date of acquisition is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition 

as of january 3 2016  the allocations of purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2014 and 2013  were final the preliminary allocations of the purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2015  were based upon initial valuations our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete our valuations within the measurement periods which are up to one year from the respective acquisition dates the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances and residual goodwill we expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition dates during the measurement periods during the measurement periods we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of those dates with our adoption of accounting standards update no 201516 simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments asu no 201516 during 2015 these adjustments will be made in the periods in which the amounts are determined and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition dates the portion of the adjustment which relates to a prior period should either be presented separately on the consolidated statement of operations or disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements all changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement periods are also included in current period earnings 

during fiscal year 2015  we obtained information to assist in determining the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of our acquisitions and adjusted our purchase price allocations based on this information for acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2015 we recognized a decrease in deferred taxes of 05 million  with a corresponding decrease in goodwill for the perten acquisition we recognized increases in intangible assets of 20 million  and liabilities assumed of 12 million  which were offset by a decrease in goodwill of 34 million  deferred taxes of 28 million  and other current assets of 02 million  for other acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2014 we recognized a decrease in working capital and other adjustments of 05 million  with a corresponding decrease in goodwill in addition during the third quarter of fiscal year 2015  in connection with updating the provisional purchase accounting for the perten acquisition we adjusted goodwill and intangible assets which had been preliminarily recorded in us dollars to swedish krona this resulted in a decrease in intangible assets and goodwill of 214 million  and a corresponding increase in other comprehensive loss through increased foreign currency translation adjustments as a result of the change in the exchange rate between the acquisition date and june 28 2015 of the 214 million  decrease 82 million  related to changes in the exchange rate from the acquisition date through december 28 2014 during fiscal year 2015  there was an immaterial impact on the current period net income as a result of the change to the provisional amounts for items that would have been recognized in previous periods if the adjustments to provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date 

allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition 

date based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period 

as of january 3 2016  we may have to pay contingent consideration related to acquisitions with open contingency periods of up to 954 million  as of january 3 2016  we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 574 million  of which 94 million  was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and 480 million  was recorded in longterm liabilities as of december 28 2014  we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of 01 million  which was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities the expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed 6  years from the respective acquisition dates and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at january 3 2016  was 2  years if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of definitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional contingent consideration which would be recognized as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations 

in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin thereon the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services we do not include any costs associated with selling effort research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs in most acquisitions profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition the sum of the costs and operating income approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a thirdparty to assume the obligation 

contingencies including tax matters 

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 118 million  and 123 million  as of january 3 2016  and december 28 2014  respectively which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims during fiscal year 2014 we recorded a benefit of 23 million  for cost reimbursements related to a particular site of which 12 million  was for future monitoring and mitigation activities during fiscal year 2013 we accrued an additional 57 million  related to a particular site for increased monitoring and mitigation activities of which 46 million  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

various tax years after 2009  remain open to examination by certain jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such as finland germany italy netherlands singapore the united kingdom and the united states the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 

we are subject to various claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in our opinion based on our review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these contingencies at january 3 2016  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in emerging markets such as china and brazil as well as from increased demand for our medical imaging business new wireless cassette detector used in diagnostic imaging and veterinary applications in the research market we experienced growth related to our onesource laboratory service informatics radiometric detection and highcontent screening offerings as well as our microfluidics technology licensing program this growth in the research market was partially offset by declines in some products in our research market due to weakness in the global academic end market specifically in europe as well as the expiration of certain patents in our licensing portfolio

during fiscal year 2016  we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2015  primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

at january 3 2016  we had cash and cash equivalents of 2379 million  of which 2340 million  was held by our nonus subsidiaries and we had 2065 million  of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility we had no other liquid investments at january 3 2016  

  

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed of the 2340 million  of cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries at january 3 2016  we would incur us taxes on approximately 1564 million  if transferred to the us without proper planning we expect the accumulated nonus cash balances which may not be transferred to the us without incurring us taxes will remain outside of the us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows use of us cash balances external borrowings or some combination of these sources 

  

on october 23 2014 our board authorized us to repurchase up to 80 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program the repurchase program will expire on october 23 2016 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2015  we repurchased 15 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 720 million  including commissions under the repurchase program as of january 3 2016  59 million  shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program from january 4 2016 through february 25 2016  we repurchased 24 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 1097 million  including commissions under the repurchase program 

  

in addition our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans during fiscal year 2015  we repurchased 95129  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 44 million  

the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability creating increased volatility in security prices widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

  

our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets with respect to plans outside of the united states we expect to contribute 93 million  in the aggregate during fiscal year 2016  during fiscal year 2015  we contributed 149 million  in the aggregate to pension plans outside of the united states and 200 million  to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans during fiscal year 2014  we contributed 112 million  in the aggregate to plans outside of the united states during fiscal year 2013  we made contributions of 370 million  for the 2012 plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states during fiscal year 2013  we contributed 202 million  in the aggregate to plans outside of the united states which includes an additional contribution of 100 million  to our defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans 

effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board the fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates unless otherwise discussed such pronouncements did not have or will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 

in february 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201602 leases  the provisions of this guidance are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted we are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in november 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu no 201517 under this new guidance companies are required to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and any related valuation allowances as noncurrent on our consolidated balance sheet the provisions of this guidance can be applied prospectively or retrospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 with early adoption permitted during fiscal year 2015 we early adopted the new guidance on a prospective basis and have presented all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet at january 3 2016 if we elected to adopt the standard on a retrospective basis current deferred tax assets of 620 million  would have been classified as noncurrent at december 28 2014  

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201516 under this new guidance an acquirer should recognize adjustments to provisional amounts for items in a business combination that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined the acquirer should record in the same period’s financial statements the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects if any as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date the provisions of this guidance are to be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 with early adoption permitted during the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 we early adopted the new guidance and adjusted the provisional amounts recorded for acquisitions in which the purchase accounting allocations were preliminary during fiscal year 2015 there was an immaterial impact on the current period net income as a result of the change to the provisional amounts for items that would have been recognized in previous periods if the adjustments to provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date 

in july 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201511 simplifying the measurement of inventory  under this new guidance companies that use inventory measurement methods other than lastin firstout or the retail inventory method should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value the provisions of this guidance are to be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 with early adoption permitted we are evaluating the requirements of this guidance the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in april 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201504 practical expedient for the measurement date of an employer’s defined benefit obligation and plan assets  under this new guidance an entity with a fiscal yearend that does not coincide with a calendar monthend for example an entity that has a 5253 week fiscal year has the ability as a practical expedient to measure its defined benefit retirement obligations and related plan assets as of the monthend that is closest to its fiscal year end the provisions of this guidance should be applied prospectively during fiscal year 2015 we early adopted the new guidance the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in april 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201503 interest  imputation of interest  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  under this new guidance debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability should be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the provisions of this guidance are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 with early adoption permitted we early adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 the consolidated balance sheet as of december 28 2014 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k reflects a restatement to reclassify unamortized debt issuance costs of 65 million  from other longterm assets to longterm debt for debt issuance costs paid to secure revolving credit facilities we made a policy election to present such costs as a direct deduction from the debt liability in the consolidated balance sheet 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  under this new guidance an entity should use a fivestep process to recognize revenue depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in 

exchange for those goods or services the standard also requires new disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers subsequent to the issuance of the standard the fasb decided to defer the effective date for one year to annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption permitted for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 the standard may be adopted either using a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach we are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the transition method to use or the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows we do not intend to early adopt this standard 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition warranty costs bad debts inventories accounting for business combinations and dispositions longlived assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for products that include installation and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete for revenue that includes customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue after the acceptance criteria have been met certain of our products require specialized installation revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as services are rendered 

in limited circumstances we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component including cord blood processing and storage for these arrangements the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a sellingprice hierarchy a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis a delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting the selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe if such evidence is available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and managements best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available tpe is the price of our or any competitors largely interchangeable products or services in standalone sales to similarlysituated customers besp is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis considering market conditions and entityspecific factors 

  

revenue from software licenses and services was 5  of our total revenue for each of fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013  we sell our software licenses with maintenance services and in some cases also with consulting services for the undelivered elements we determine vsoe of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately we determine vsoe for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the amount that was separately charged for the maintenance renewal period we determine vsoe for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements when a software license sale is not involved 

  

we recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance andor consulting services upon shipment using the residual method provided that the above criteria have been met if vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered or if the only undelivered element is maintenance then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period 

  

the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings accounts are writtenoff only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted 

  

inventory valuation we value inventory at the lower of cost or market inventories are accounted for using the firstin firstout method we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest inprocess research and development “iprd” is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period 

value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered through fiscal year 2015  we conducted annual goodwill impairment assessments for our reporting units we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using measurement dates of january 1 2015  and january 1 2014  and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment at january 1 2015  the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 200  for each reporting unit with the exception of the perten reporting unit in which its fair value approximated carrying value as expected based on the recent acquisition date at the beginning of fiscal year 2015 we realigned our organization which resulted in a change in the composition of our reporting units within our human health and environmental health segments onesource our multivendor laboratory service business that serves the life sciences end market was moved from our environmental health segment into our human health segment as of december 28 2014 as a result of the new alignment we reallocated 412 million  of goodwill from our environmental health segment to our 

human health segment based on the relative fair value determined using the income approach of the onesource laboratory service business within our historical environmental health segment while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future 

nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the nonamortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a nonamortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite the assets will be tested for impairment these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization during fiscal year 2013 we recorded a charge of 02 million  for the impairment of certain longlived assets within our human health segment as the carrying amounts of the longlived assets were not recoverable and exceeded their fair value the noncash impairment of longlived assets has been recorded as a separate component of operating expenses 

employee compensation and benefits we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar monthend that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement 

we recognized a loss  of 94 million  in fiscal year 2015  a loss  of 777 million  in fiscal year 2014  and income  of 182 million  in fiscal year 2013  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans which includes the charge for the marktomarket adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans which was recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the loss or income related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans was a pretax loss  of 124 million  in fiscal year 2015  a pretax loss  of 759 million  in fiscal year 2014  and pretax income  of 176 million  in fiscal year 2013  we expect income of approximately 13 million  in fiscal year 2016  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans excluding the charge for or benefit from the marktomarket adjustment it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a marktomarket adjustment in fiscal year 2016  marktomarket adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control including changes in interest rates the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease markto market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2016  conversely to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected markto market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2016  pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year beginning in fiscal year 2016 the approach we use to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for certain benefit plans will be changed to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs prior to fiscal year 2016 we calculated these service and interest components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period beginning in fiscal year 2016 we have elected to utilize an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period based on current economic conditions we estimate that the service cost and interest cost for these certain plans will be reduced in fiscal year 2016 we will account for this as a change in accounting estimate 

as of january 3 2016  we estimate the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 725  and to be 530  for all plans outside the united states in addition as of january 3 2016  we estimate the discount rate for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 424  and to be 288  for all plans outside the united states for the plans in the united states as of december 28 2014 we adopted a new mortality base table rp2014 with projection scale mp2014 that was published by the society of actuaries in 2014 the adoption of the new mortality base table resulted in a 321 million  increase to our projected benefit obligation as of december 28 2014 during fiscal year 2015 the society of actuaries issued an updated mortality improvement scale that reflects smaller improvements in longevity than predicted by its mp2014 scale we adopted 

the updated projection scale mp2015 as of january 3 2016 the adoption of the updated projection scale resulted in a 68 million  decrease to the projected benefit obligation at january 3 2016 we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date 

if any of our assumptions were to change as of january 3 2016  our pension plan expenses would also change 



we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and contractual agreements ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and iii impairment of assets as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled “restructuring and contract termination charges net” 

dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation which meets the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the fiscal year ended january 3 2016  pretax loss es from the disposition of discontinued operations was not material any such changes decrease or increase current earnings 

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

additionally we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards state income tax credit carryforwards and certain foreign tax attributes valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision 

taxes have not been provided on unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries that we consider indefinitely reinvested because we plan to keep these amounts indefinitely reinvested overseas except for instances where we can remit such earnings to the us without an associated net tax cost our indefinite reinvestment determination is based on the future operational and capital requirements of our us and nonus operations as of january 3 2016  the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the us indefinitely and for which no us tax cost has been provided was approximately 8590 million  it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments derivatives marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january 3 2016  

  

we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments by nature all financial instruments involve market and credit risks we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments approximately 60  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can increase the costs of financing investing and operating the business 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12  months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statement of cash flows 

  

principal hedged currencies include the british pound euro japanese yen and singapore dollar we held forward foreign exchange contracts designated as economic hedges with us dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling 1273 million  at january 3 2016  950 million  at december 28 2014  and 1384 million  at december 29 2013  and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative 

contracts are not material the duration of these contracts was generally 30  days or less during each of fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013  

in addition in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance our acquisitions we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies we record these hedges at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets the unrealized gains and losses on these hedges as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans are recognized immediately in interest and other expense net the cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within our consolidated statement of cash flows 

during fiscal year 2014 we entered into five  forward foreign exchange contracts designated as economic hedges with settlement dates in fiscal year 2015 and combined euro denominated notional amounts of €2382 million  outstanding as of december 28 2014  designated as economic hedges that were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements during fiscal year 2015 we settled several of these forward exchange contracts during fiscal year 2015 we also entered into new forward foreign exchange contracts that settled in fiscal year 2015 or will settle in fiscal year 2016 the combined euro denominated notional amounts of these outstanding hedges was €1074 million  and €2382 million  as of january 3 2016  and december 28 2014  respectively the net gains and losses on these derivatives combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material for fiscal years 2015 and 2014  during fiscal year 2015  we received 187 million  as a result of the settlement of these hedges 

in may 2008 we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million  upon the issuance of our 2015 notes and recognized 84 million  net of taxes of 54 million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive loss income during fiscal year 2013 we amortized a pretax loss of 20 million  into interest and other expense net in addition during fiscal year 2013 we redeemed all of our 2015 notes and recognized a pretax loss of 28 million  for the remaining unamortized derivative losses into interest and other expense net 

market risk 

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 60  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in natural hedges 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be positively but not proportionately impacted conversely when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be negatively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95  confidence interval and a holding period of 30  days as of january 3 2016  this computation estimated that there is a 5  chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 05 million  this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2015  the valueatrisk ranged between 03 million  and 09 million  with an average of approximately 05 million  

  

interest rate risk as described above in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

in may 2008  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million  upon the issuance of our 2015 notes and recognized 84 million  net of taxes of 54 million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive loss income during fiscal year 2013 we amortized a pretax loss of 20 million  into interest and other expense net in addition during fiscal year 2013 we redeemed all of our 2015 notes and recognized a pretax loss of 28 million  for the remaining unamortized derivative losses into interest and other expense net 

interest rate risk—sensitivity  as of january 3 2016  our debt portfolio consisted of 4820 million  of variable rate debt in addition our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 2379 million  at january 3 2016  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

i changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt consisting of 4820 million  of revolving debt facilities to fluctuate an increase of 10  or approximately 14  basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pretax charge to our earnings of 07 million  for fiscal year 2016  

  

ii changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate as described above an increase of 10  or approximately 14  basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 07 million  for fiscal year 2016  

  

iii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 3 2016  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in the 2013 internal controlintegrated framework 

based on this assessment our management concluded that as of january 3 2016  our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

our registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting this report appears below

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 3 2016  based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

recent developments 

as part of our strategy to grow our core businesses we have recently taken the following actions 

strategic business realignment 

in january 2015 we approved and announced a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year 2015 that is designed to enable us to both deliver complete solutions targeted towards certain end markets and to develop valueadded applications and solutions to foster further expansion of those markets as part of this realignment our onesource multivendor service offering business that serves the life sciences end market will be moved from our environmental health segment into our human health segment beginning in fiscal year 2015 we will report financial results under our human health and environmental health segments using this new alignment 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2014 

acquisition of perten instruments group ab in december 2014 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of perten instruments group ab perten perten is a provider of analytical instruments and services for quality control of food grain flour and feed we expect this acquisition to enhance our industrial environmental and safety business by expanding our product offerings to the academic and industrial end markets we paid the shareholders of perten 2699 million  in cash for the stock of perten we have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our environmental health segment from the acquisition date

restructuring 

during fiscal year 2014  we recorded pretax restructuring charges of 77 million  in our human health segment and 67 million  in our environmental health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities our management approved these plans principally to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives and to focus resources on higher growth end markets we also recorded net pretax restructuring reversals of 08 million  in our human health segment and 17 million  in our environmental health segment related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions which were partially offset by higher than expected costs for the closure of excess facility space in addition during fiscal year 2014  we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 15 million  in our environmental health segment primarily as a result of terminating various contractual commitments this pretax restructuring activity has been reported as restructuring and contract termination charges and is included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect no  significant impact on future operating results or cash flows from the restructuring activities executed in fiscal year 2014 

  

as part of our ongoing business strategy we also took the following actions 

share repurchase program   

on october 24 2012 our board of directors our board authorized us to repurchase up to 60 million  shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program the repurchase program expired on october 24 2014 on october 23 2014 our board authorized us to repurchase up to 80 million shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program the new repurchase program the new repurchase program will expire on october 23 2016 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2014  we repurchased 14 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 613 million  including commissions under these repurchase programs as of december 28 2014  approximately 74 million  shares authorized by our board under the new repurchase program remained available for repurchase 

discontinued operations   

in may 2014 our management approved the shutdown of our microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states which had been reported within our human health segment we determined that with the lack of adequate reimbursement from health care payers the microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states would need significant investment in its operations to reduce costs in order to effectively compete in the market the shutdown of the microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states resulted in a 01 million  net pretax loss  primarily related to the disposal of fixed assets which was partially offset by the sale of a building in fiscal year 2014  

  

business segments and products 

we report our business in two segments human health and environmental health we performed our annual impairment testing on january 1 2014  the annual impairment date for our reporting units and based on the first step of the impairment process the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment

marketing 

all of our businesses market their products and services primarily through their own specialized sales forces as of december 28 2014  we employed approximately 3600  sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35  countries and marketing products and services in more than 150  countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials key components and supplies 

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with certain of our suppliers for certain critical raw materials key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify 

alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components see the applicable risk factor in “item 1a risk factors” for an additional description of this risk 

  

intellectual property 

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties 

  

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

due to the wide range of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors this affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation operational efficiency product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market niches we expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

we believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition 

  

research and development 

research and development expenditures were 1211 million  during fiscal year 2014  1324 million  during fiscal year 2013  and 1318 million  during fiscal year 2012  

  

we have a broad product base and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs we directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012  primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental industrial and laboratory service and support markets within our environmental health segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives we expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2015  and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental industrial and laboratory services markets within our environmental health segment 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing uses emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in 

connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 123 million  and 135 million  as of december 28 2014  and december 29 2013  respectively which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims these amounts are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities during fiscal year 2014 we recorded a benefit of 23 million  for cost reimbursements related to a particular site of which 12 million  was for future monitoring and mitigation activities during fiscal year 2013 we accrued an additional 57 million  related to a particular site for increased monitoring and mitigation activities of which 46 million  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

as of december 28 2014  we employed approximately 7700  employees in our continuing operations several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of december 28 2014  we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately 1500  union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding restrictions in capital expenditures general economic conditions cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

our growth is subject to global economic and political conditions and operational disruptions at our facilities 

our business is affected by global economic conditions and the state of the financial markets particularly as the united states and other countries balance concerns around debt inflation growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives there can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows results of operations financial position or our ability to access capital such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the united states and internationally our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location 

while we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities a major earthquake fire flood power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations 

could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments or other measures and some of these risks are insurable but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

 many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable or successfully divest businesses 

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our acquisition of perten in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons such as 

 some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences loss of key personnel unforeseen regulatory requirements previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results additionally if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies which may adversely impact our profitability 

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies the expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs as a result small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

 15 

 a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the united states postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals tantalum tin gold tungsten and their derivatives which may be contained in our products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as a result of these rules we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the components used in our products be certified as conflictfree and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs 

the manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies in the united states and abroad we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil criminal or monetary penalties 

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions some of the products produced by our human health segment are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

we are also subject to a variety of laws regulations and standards that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances and our business practices in the united states and abroad such as antibribery anticorruption and competition laws this requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws regulations and standards a failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2014  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 17 

 if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and scientists and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems software and technologies successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to develop manufacture and provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

we have a substantial amount of outstanding debt which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business 

our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 in addition we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 5 senior unsecured notes due in 2021 the 2021 notes include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company these include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

 we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments 

any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility our 2021 notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances 

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

as of december 28 2014  our total assets included 28 billion  of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights customer relationships core technology and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets 

adverse changes in our business adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units or the failure to grow our human health and environmental health segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our share price will fluctuate 

over the last several years stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 

 dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

on october 23 2014  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2014  that will be payable in february 2015  on january 23 2015  we announced that our board had 

declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the first  quarter of fiscal year 2015  that will be payable in may 2015  in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

overview of fiscal year 2014   

during fiscal year 2014  we continued to see good performance from acquisitions investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives our overall revenue in fiscal year 2014   increase d 796 million  or 4  as compared to fiscal year 2013  reflecting an increase  of 423 million  or 4  in our human health segment revenue and an increase  of 373 million  or 4  in our environmental health segment revenue the increase  in our human health segment revenue during fiscal year 2014  was primarily due to growth in our diagnostics market from our newborn and prenatal screening and infectious disease testing solutions as well as from our medical imaging business new wireless cassette detector the increase  in our environmental health segment revenue during fiscal year 2014  was primarily due to an increase in our services revenue which included our onesource multivendor service offerings within our laboratory service market 

in our human health segment during fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  we experienced growth in our diagnostics business as birth rates increased and from continued expansion of our prenatal newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in emerging markets such as china and brazil as well as from increased demand for our medical imaging business new wireless cassette detector used in diagnostic imaging and veterinary applications in the research market we experienced growth related to our informatics radiometric detection and highcontent screening offerings as well as our microfluidics technology licensing program this growth in the research market was partially offset by declines in some products in our research market due to weakness in the global academic end market specifically in europe as well as the expiration of certain patents in our licensing portfolio as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers we anticipate that the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease which can result in savings of longterm health care costs as well as create better outcomes for patients are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets 

in our environmental health segment our laboratory services business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time while reducing maintenance costs all of which continue to be critical for our customers during fiscal year 2014  we continued to experience growth in our laboratory services business which included the addition of new customers to our onesource multivendor service offering these increases were partially offset by decreased demand across some of our products in the environmental and industrial markets primarily in the asian industrial end markets we anticipate that the continued development of contaminant regulations and corresponding testing protocols will result in increased demand for efficient analytically sensitive and information rich testing solutions 

our consolidated gross margins decrease d 34  basis points in fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  due to unfavorable changes in product mix with an increase in sales of lower gross margin product offerings pricing pressure a higher marktomarket loss  for our postretirement benefit plans in fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  and negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rates these items were partially offset by increased sales volume and cost containment and productivity initiatives our consolidated operating margin decrease d 114  basis points in fiscal year 2014  as compared to fiscal year 2013  primarily due to a pretax loss  of 759 million  in fiscal year 2014  as compared to pretax income  of 176 million  in fiscal year 2013  for the marktomarket adjustments for our postretirement plans and lower gross margins these items were partially offset by increased sales volume cost containment and productivity initiatives and lower restructuring charges 

we believe we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the spending trends in our end markets and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services overall we believe that our strategic focus on human health and environmental health coupled with our breadth of end markets deep portfolio of technologies and applications leading market positions global scale and financial strength will provide us with a foundation for growth

in may 2014 our management approved the shutdown of our microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states which had been reported within our human health segment we determined that with the lack of adequate reimbursement from health care payers the microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states would need significant investment in its operations to reduce costs in order to effectively compete in the market the shutdown of the microarraybased diagnostic testing laboratory in the united states resulted in a 01 million  net pretax loss  primarily related to the disposal of fixed assets which was partially offset by the sale of a building in fiscal year 2014  

in june 2010 we sold our photoflash business which was included in our environmental health segment we recognized a pretax loss  of 001 million  in fiscal year 2014  a pretax gain  of 05 million  in fiscal year 2013  and a pretax gain  of 25 million  in fiscal year 2012  for contingent consideration related to this sale these gains and losses were recognized as a loss gain on disposition of discontinued operations

allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period 

we may have to pay contingent consideration related to all acquisitions with open contingency periods of up to 314 million  as of december 28 2014  as of december 28 2014  we had recorded contingent consideration obligations relating to our acquisition of tetra teknolojik sistemler limited sirketi with an estimated fair value of 01 million  the earnout period for each of these acquisitions does not exceed three  years from the respective acquisition date if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of definitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed 

in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin thereon the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services we do not include any costs associated with selling effort research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs in most acquisitions profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition the sum of the costs and operating income approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a thirdparty to assume the obligation 

contingencies including tax matters 

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 123 million  and 135 million  as of december 28 2014  and december 29 2013  respectively which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims these amounts are recorded in 

accrued expenses and other current liabilities during fiscal year 2014 we recorded a benefit of 23 million  for cost reimbursements related to a particular site of which 12 million  was for future monitoring and mitigation activities during fiscal year 2013 we accrued an additional 57 million  related to a particular site for increased monitoring and mitigation activities of which 46 million  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements the cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

various tax years after 2007  remain open to examination by certain tax jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such as china finland germany italy netherlands singapore the united kingdom and the united states the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 

we are subject to various claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these contingencies at december 28 2014  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

5  senior unsecured notes due in 2021 on october 25 2011 we issued 5000 million  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in 2021 in a registered public offering and received 4969 million  of net proceeds from the issuance the 2021 notes were issued at 99372  of the principal amount which resulted in a discount of 31 million  as of december 28 2014  the 2021 notes had an aggregate carrying value of 4977 million  net of 23 million  of unamortized original issue discount as of december 29 2013  the 2021 notes had an aggregate carrying value of 4974 million  net of 26 million  of unamortized original issue discount the 2021 notes mature in november 2021  and bear interest at an annual rate of 5  interest on the 2021 notes is payable semiannually on may 15th and november 15th each year prior to august 15 2021 three months prior to their maturity date we may redeem the 2021 notes in whole or in part at our option at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the 2021 notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2021 notes being redeemed discounted on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate plus 45 basis points plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after august 15 2021 three months prior to their maturity date we may redeem the 2021 notes at our option at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2021 notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest upon a change of control as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 notes  and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2021 notes below investment grade each holder of 2021 notes will have the right to require us to repurchase such holders 2021 notes for 101  of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december 28 2014  

financing lease obligations in fiscal year 2012 we entered into agreements with the lessors of certain buildings that we are currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings we provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings and as a result we are considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period at the end of the construction period we were not reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs we are therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases qualify as financing leases under saleleaseback accounting guidance representing debt obligations for us and noncash investing and financing activities as a result we capitalized 293 million  in property and equipment net representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt we have also capitalized 115 million  in additional construction costs necessary to complete the renovations to the buildings which were funded by the lessors with a corresponding increase to debt at december 28 2014  we had 393 million  recorded for these financing lease obligations of which 11 million  was recorded as shortterm debt and 382 million  was recorded as longterm debt at december 29 2013  we had 403 million  recorded for these financing lease obligations of which 26 million  was recorded as shortterm debt and 377 million  was recorded as longterm debt the buildings are being depreciated on a straightline basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values which will equal the remaining financing obligation at the end of the lease term at the end of the lease term the remaining balances in property plant and equipment net and debt will be reversed against each other 

  

dividends 

our board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 007  per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2014 and 2013  resulting in an annual dividend rate of 028  per share at december 28 2014  we had accrued 79 million for dividends declared on october 23 2014 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014  payable in february 2015  on january 23 2015  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the first  quarter of fiscal year 2015  that will be payable in may 2015  in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 28 2014  for continuing and discontinued operations purchase commitments are minimal and have been excluded from this table 

  



 

   

capital expenditures 

during fiscal year 2015  we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2014  primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

at december 28 2014  we had cash and cash equivalents of 1748 million  of which 1703 million  was held by our nonus subsidiaries and we had 1718 million  of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility we had no other liquid investments at december 28 2014  

  

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed of the 1703 million  of cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries at december 28 2014  we would incur us taxes on approximately 1571 million  if transferred to the us without proper planning we expect the accumulated nonus cash balances which may not be transferred to the us without incurring us taxes will remain outside of the us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows use of us cash balances external borrowings or some combination of these sources 

  

on october 24 2012 our board authorized us to repurchase up to 60 million  shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program the repurchase program expired on october 24 2014 on october 23 2014 our board authorized us to repurchase up to 80 million shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program the new repurchase program the new repurchase program will expire on october 23 2016 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2014  we repurchased 14 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 613 million  including commissions under these repurchase programs as of december 28 2014  approximately 74 million  shares authorized by our board under the new repurchase program remained available for repurchase 

  

our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive 

plans during fiscal year 2014  we repurchased 98269  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 43 million  

the repurchased shares have been reflected as a reduction in shares outstanding but remain available to be reissued with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the new repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability creating increased volatility in security prices widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

  

our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets we expect to contribute 200 million  in the aggregate during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015  for the 2014 plan year to one of our plans within the united states with respect to plans outside of the united states we expect to contribute 102 million  in the aggregate during fiscal year 2015  we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans during fiscal year 2014  we contributed 112 million  in the aggregate to plans outside of the united states during fiscal year 2013  we made contributions of 370 million  for the 2012 plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states during fiscal year 2013  we contributed 202 million  in the aggregate to plans outside of the united states which includes an additional contribution of 100 million  to our defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 we notified employees of our intention to terminate their employment as part of the q3 2014 restructuring plan the removal of these participants may decrease the expected future service lives in excess of the curtailment limit for one of our pension plans which would result in a curtailment gain if the curtailment occurs the curtailment will be measured and recorded when the notified employees are separated from us as part of a curtailment we are required to remeasure the pension plans assets and liabilities based upon current discount rates and the fair value of the pension plans assets as of the curtailment date which may result in an additional gain or loss in addition to the curtailment gain employee separation is expected to be completed during the first half of fiscal year 2015 

effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates unless otherwise discussed such pronouncements did not have or will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 

in april 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity  under this new guidance only disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results will be presented as discontinued operations the standard also requires new disclosures related to individually significant disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation the provisions of this guidance are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2014 we will utilize this new guidance when reporting new discontinued operations or disclosing new disposals in our future filings 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  under this new guidance an entity uses a fivestep process to recognize revenue which depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard also requires new disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers the provisions of this guidance are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 we are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition warranty costs bad debts inventories accounting for business combinations and dispositions longlived assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for products that include installation and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete for revenue that includes customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue after the acceptance criteria have been met certain of our products require specialized installation revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as services are rendered 

  

in limited circumstances we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component including cord blood processing and storage for these arrangements the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a sellingprice hierarchy a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis a delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting the selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe if such evidence is available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and managements best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available tpe is the price of our or any competitors largely interchangeable products or services in standalone sales to similarlysituated customers besp is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis considering market conditions and entityspecific factors 

  

revenue from software licenses and services was 5  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2014  5  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2013  and 3  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2012  we sell our software licenses with maintenance services and in some cases also with consulting services for the undelivered elements we determine vsoe of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately we determine vsoe for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the amount that was separately charged for the maintenance renewal period we determine vsoe for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements when a software license sale is not involved 

  

we recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance andor consulting services upon shipment using the residual method provided that the above criteria have been met if vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered or if the only undelivered element is maintenance then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period 

  

the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings accounts are writtenoff only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted 

  

inventory valuation we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase andor manufacture we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

  

business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest inprocess research and development “iprd” is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed 

value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered through fiscal year 2014  we conducted annual goodwill impairment assessments for our reporting units we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using measurement dates of january 1 2014  and january 1 2013  and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment at january 1 2014  the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 900  for each reporting unit with the exception of the life sciences and technology reporting unit where the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 110  the carrying value of the goodwill for the life sciences and technology reporting unit was 7963 million  at the annual impairment date for fiscal year 2014  during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 we realigned our organization which resulted in a change in the composition of our reporting units within the human health segment our informatics business was moved from the life sciences and technology reporting unit to its own reporting unit and we reallocated 2203 million  of goodwill to the informatics reporting unit based on the relative fair value of each of these businesses we concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment for either the life sciences and technology reporting unit or the informatics reporting unit as the fair value exceeded the carrying value for each of these reporting units as of the date of the realignment while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future 

nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the nonamortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a nonamortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite the assets will be tested for impairment these intangible assets will 

then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization in fiscal year 2012 as part of integrating our recent acquisitions we decided that prospectively we would primarily focus on the perkinelmer trade name accordingly we undertook a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy which resulted in pretax impairment charges of 742 million  in fiscal year 2012 we concluded that the impairment for trade names was not a triggering event for goodwill because the impairment occurred as a result of our decision to phase out certain trade names we do not believe that our future cash flows will be significantly impacted by these changes during fiscal year 2013 we recorded a charge of 02 million  for the impairment of certain longlived assets within our human health segment as the carrying amounts of the longlived assets were not recoverable and exceeded their fair value these noncash impairments of longlived assets including intangible assets have been recorded as a separate component of operating expenses 

  

employee compensation and benefits we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement 

  

we recognized a loss  of 777 million  in fiscal year 2014  income  of 182 million  in fiscal year 2013  and a loss  of 353 million  in fiscal year 2012  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans which includes the charge for the marktomarket adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans which was recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the gain or expense related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans was a pretax loss  of 759 million  in fiscal year 2014  pretax income  of 176 million  in fiscal year 2013  and a pretax loss  of 318 million  in fiscal year 2012  we expect income of approximately 02 million  in fiscal year 2015  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans excluding the charge for or benefit from the marktomarket adjustment or the potential additional curtailment gain it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a marktomarket adjustment in fiscal year 2015  marktomarket adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control including changes in interest rates the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease markto market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2015  conversely to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected markto market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2015  pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year 

as of december 28 2014  we estimate the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 725  and to be 460  for all plans outside the united states in addition as of december 28 2014  we estimate the discount rate for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the united states to be 407  and to be 275  for all plans outside the united states for our plans in the united states as of december 28 2014  we adopted the new mortality base table rp2014 with projection scale mp2014 that was published by the society of actuaries in 2014 the adoption of the new mortality base table resulted in a 321 million  increase to the projected benefit obligation at december 28 2014  we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date 

if any of our assumptions were to change as of december 28 2014  our pension plan expenses would also change 

  



  

we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

  

restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and contractual agreements ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and iii impairment of assets as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled “restructuring and contract termination charges net” 

  

dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the fiscal year ended december 28 2014  we recorded 03 million  in pretax loss es from the disposition of discontinued operations any such changes decrease or increase current earnings 

  

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

  

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount andor iii the 

statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

  

additionally we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards state income tax credit carryforwards and certain foreign tax attributes valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision 

  

taxes have not been provided on unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries that we consider indefinitely reinvested because we plan to keep these amounts indefinitely reinvested overseas except for instances where we can remit such earnings to the us without an associated net tax cost our indefinite reinvestment determination is based on the future operational and capital requirements of our us and nonus operations as of december 28 2014  the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the us indefinitely and for which no us tax cost has been provided was approximately 6750 million  it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments derivatives marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december 28 2014  

  

we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments by nature all financial instruments involve market and credit risks we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments approximately 60  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies therefore the fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing investing and operating the business 

  

in the ordinary course of business we may enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily denominated in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12  months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings 

  

principal hedged currencies include the british pound euro japanese yen and singapore dollar we held forward foreign exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges with us dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling 950 million  at december 28 2014  1384 million  at december 29 2013  and 643 million  at december 30 2012  and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material the duration of these contracts was generally 30  days or less during fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012  

  

during fiscal year 2014  we entered into five  forward foreign exchange contracts with settlement dates in fiscal year 2015 and combined euro denominated notional amounts of €2382 million  designated as cash flow hedges that were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements the fair value of these currency derivative contracts at december 28 2014  was not material the unrealized gain which was recorded in other 

comprehensive income will be recognized in interest and other expense net in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction occurs and impacts earnings such amounts were not material for fiscal year 2014 during december 2012 we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts with settlement dates in fiscal year 2013 and combined euro denominated notional amounts of €500 million  designated as cash flow hedges during fiscal year 2013 we settled these euro denominated forward foreign exchange contracts the derivative gains were recognized in the period in which the underlying hedged exposures occurred and impacted earnings and were recorded in interest and other expense net such amounts were not material for fiscal year 2013 

  

in may 2008 we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million  upon the issuance of our 2015 notes and recognized 84 million  net of taxes of 54 million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income during each of fiscal years 2013 and 2012  we amortized a pretax loss of 20 million  into interest and other expense net in addition during fiscal year 2013 we redeemed all of our 2015 notes and recognized a pretax loss of 28 million  for the remaining unamortized derivative losses into interest and other expense net 

market risk 

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 60  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in natural hedges 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be positively but not proportionately impacted conversely when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business sales and net income will in general be negatively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95  confidence interval and a holding period of 30  days as of december 28 2014  this computation estimated that there is a 5  chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 05 million  this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2014  the valueatrisk ranged between 02 million  and 09 million  with an average of approximately 05 million  

  

interest rate risk as described above in “item 7 liquidity and capital resources” our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

  

in may 2008  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million  upon the issuance of our 2015 notes and recognized 84 million  net of taxes of 54 million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income during each of fiscal years 2013 and 2012  we amortized a pretax loss of 20 million  into interest and other expense net in addition during fiscal year 2013 we redeemed all of our 2015 notes and recognized a pretax loss of 28 million  for the remaining unamortized derivative losses into interest and other expense net 

interest rate risk—sensitivity  as of december 28 2014  our debt portfolio consisted of 5160 million  of variable rate debt in addition our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 1748 million  at december 28 2014  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

i changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt consisting of 5160 million  of revolving debt facilities to fluctuate an increase of 10  or approximately 13  basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pretax charge to our earnings of 07 million  for fiscal year 2015  

  

ii changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate as described above an increase of 10  or approximately 13  basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 07 million  for fiscal year 2015  

  

iii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 28 2014  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in the 2013  internal controlintegrated framework our assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal controls of perten acquired on december 5 2014 which is included in our 2014 consolidated financial statements and represented approximately 78  of our total assets as of december 28 2014 and 03  of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended december 28 2014 

based on this assessment our management concluded that as of december 28 2014  our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

our registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting this report appears below

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 28 2014  based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 28 2014  of the company and our report dated february 24 2015  expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

recent developments 

as part of our strategy to grow our core businesses we have recently taken the following actions 

strategic business realignment 

we realigned our organization at the beginning of fiscal year 2013 to allow us to implement our strategy and propel our vision to improve global health by innovating technologies that help make healthcare more effective affordable and accessible around the world our informatics business as well as our field service on products previously sold by our former biodiscovery business were moved from our environmental health segment into our human health segment the results reported for fiscal year 2013 reflect this new alignment of our operating segments financial information relating to fiscal years 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes to the operating segments 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2013 

we completed the acquisition of four businesses for total consideration of 114 million  in cash as of the closing dates we potentially had to pay additional contingent consideration for the four acquired businesses of up to 22 million  which at closing had an estimated fair value of 11 million  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of each of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforce acquired and has been allocated to goodwill none of which is tax deductible we reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our operations from the acquisition dates 

restructuring 

during fiscal year 2013  we recorded a 237 million  pretax restructuring charge in our human health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space and recognized a 120 million   

pretax restructuring charge in our environmental health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space our management approved these plans principally to shift certain of our research and development resources into a newly opened center for innovation to shift certain of our operations into a newly established shared service center to realign operations research and development resources and production resources as a result of previous acquisitions and to focus resources on higher growth end markets we also recorded a pretax restructuring reversal of 15 million  primarily related to lower than expected costs primarily related to workforce reductions within our human health segment as well as a reversal of 10 million  primarily related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions within our environmental health segment during fiscal year 2013  we recorded a pretax charge of 07 million  primarily as a result of terminating various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities in our environmental health segment the pretax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring and contract termination charges and is included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect the impact of future cost savings on operating results and cash flows from restructuring activities executed in fiscal year 2013  will exceed 90 million  annually beginning in fiscal year 2015 primarily as decreases to cost of revenue selling general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 

  

as part of our ongoing business strategy we also took the following actions 

redemption of 6 senior unsecured notes due in 2015 

in december 2013 we redeemed all of our 6 senior unsecured notes due in 2015 the “2015 notes” for a redemption price that included the outstanding principal amount of 1500 million  and a prepayment premium of 111 million  which is included in other expense net the transaction also resulted in the writeoff of 28 million  for the remaining unamortized derivative losses for previously settled cash flow hedges and the writeoff of 02 million  for the remaining deferred debt issuance costs both of these amounts are included in interest expense 

share repurchase program   

on october 24 2012 our board of directors our board authorized us to repurchase up to 60 million  shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program the repurchase program will expire on october 24 2014 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2013  we repurchased approximately 36 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 1230 million  including commissions under the repurchase program as of december 29 2013  approximately 24 million  shares authorized by our board under the repurchase program remained available for repurchase

we report our business in two segments human health and environmental health we performed our annual impairment testing on january 1 2013  the annual impairment date for our reporting units and based on the first step of the impairment process the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment

marketing 

all of our businesses market their products and services primarily through their own specialized sales forces as of december 29 2013  we employed approximately 3600  sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35  countries and marketing products and services in more than 150  countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials key components and supplies 

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with certain of our suppliers for certain critical raw materials key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components see the applicable risk factor in “item 1a risk factors” for an additional description of this risk 

  

intellectual property 

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to 

significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties we are currently involved in a lawsuit involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights see “item 3 legal proceedings” for a discussion of this matter 

  

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

due to the wide range of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors this affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation operational efficiency product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market niches we expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

we believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition 

  

research and development 

research and development expenditures were 1330 million  during fiscal year 2013  1326 million  during fiscal year 2012  and 1158 million  during fiscal year 2011  

  

we have a broad product base and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs we directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011  primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental and laboratory service and support markets within our environmental health segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives we expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2014  and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental industrial and laboratory services markets within our environmental health segment 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing uses emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated during fiscal year 2013 we accrued an additional 57 million  related to a particular site for increased monitoring and mitigation activities of which 46 million  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 we have accrued 135 million  as of december 29 2013  which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site 

these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

as of december 29 2013  we employed approximately 7600  employees in our continuing operations several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of december 29 2013  we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately 1400  union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 

financial information about reporting segments 

we realigned our organization at the beginning of fiscal year 2013 to allow us to implement our strategy and propel our vision to improve global health by innovating technologies that help make healthcare more effective affordable and accessible around the world our informatics business as well as our field service on products previously sold by our former biodiscovery business were moved from our environmental health segment into our human health segment the results reported for fiscal year 2013 reflect this new alignment of our operating segments financial information relating to fiscal years 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes to the operating segments 

we have included the expenses for our corporate headquarters such as legal tax audit human resources information technology and other management and compliance costs as well as the activity related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans as “corporate” below we have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses these amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our reporting segments 

  

the table below sets forth revenue and operating income loss excluding discontinued operations by reporting segment for the fiscal years ended 

  



 

   

 

additional information relating to our reporting segments is as follows for the fiscal years ended 

  



  



financial information about geographic areas 

both of our reporting segments conduct business in and derive substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during fiscal year 2013  we had 13306 million  in sales from our international operations representing approximately 60  of our total sales during fiscal year 2013  we derived approximately 48  of our international sales from our human health segment and approximately 52  of our international sales from our environmental health segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future 

  

we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements additional geographic information is discussed in note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding restrictions in capital expenditures general economic conditions cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

our growth is subject to global economic and political conditions and operational disruptions at our facilities 

our business is affected by global economic conditions and the state of the financial markets particularly as the united states and other countries balance concerns around debt inflation growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives there can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows results of operations financial position or our ability to access capital such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the united states and internationally our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location 

while we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities a major earthquake fire flood power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations 

could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments or other measures and some of these risks are insurable but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

 many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable or successfully divest businesses 

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our acquisition of shanghai haoyuan biotech co ltd haoyuan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons such as 

 some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences loss of key personnel unforeseen regulatory requirements previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results additionally if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies which may adversely impact our profitability 

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies the expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs as a result small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

 15 

 a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the united states postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

we are subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals tantalum tin gold and tungsten which may be contained in our products are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries as a result of these rules we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the components used in our products be certified as conflictfree and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs 

the manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies in the united states and abroad we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil criminal or monetary penalties 

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions some of the products produced by our human health segment are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

we are also subject to a variety of laws regulations and standards that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances and our business practices in the united states and abroad such as antibribery anticorruption and competition laws this requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws regulations and standards a failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2013  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 17 

 if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and scientists and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems software and technologies successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

we have a substantial amount of outstanding debt which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business 

our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 in addition we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 5 senior unsecured notes due in 2021 the 2021 notes include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company these include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

 18 

 we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments 

any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility our 2021 notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances 

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

as of december 29 2013  our total assets included 26 billion  of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights core technology and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets 

adverse changes in our business adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units or the failure to grow our human health and environmental health segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our share price will fluctuate 

over the last several quarters stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 

 dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

on october 24 2013  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2013  that will be payable in february 2014  on january 24 2014  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the first  quarter of fiscal year 2014  that will be payable in may 2014  in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

we believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above and we are contesting the action vigorously while this matter is subject to uncertainty in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at december 29 2013  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

overview of fiscal year 2013   

we realigned our organization at the beginning of fiscal year 2013 to allow us to implement our strategy and propel our vision to improve global health by innovating technologies that help make healthcare more effective affordable and accessible around the world our informatics business as well as our field service on products previously sold by our former biodiscovery business were moved from our environmental health segment into our human health segment the results reported for fiscal year 2013 reflect this new alignment of our operating segments financial information relating to fiscal years 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes to the operating segments the principal products and services of our two operating segments are 

 as a result of the realignment we reallocated goodwill from the environmental health segment to the human health segment based on the relative fair value determined using the income approach of the businesses within the historical environmental health segment the change resulted in 2157 million  of goodwill being allocated from the environmental health segment to the human health segment 

during fiscal year 2013  we continued to see good performance from acquisitions investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives our overall revenue in fiscal year 2013   increase d 510 million  or 2  as compared to fiscal year 2012  reflecting an increase  of 351 million  or 3  in our human health segment revenue and an increase  of 159 million  or 2  in our environmental health segment revenue the increase  in our human health segment revenue during fiscal year 2013  was due to growth in our diagnostics business from continued expansion of our prenatal newborn and infectious disease screening solutions as well as increased demand for our informatics offerings and invivo imaging systems in the research market the increase  in our environmental health segment revenue during fiscal year 2013  was due to growth in our laboratory services business partially offset by decreased demand for some of our products in the environmental and industrial markets 

in our human health segment during fiscal year 2013  as compared to fiscal year 2012  we experienced growth in the diagnostics market as birth rates in the united states increased and from continued expansion of our prenatal newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the united states particularly in emerging markets such as china the middle east and africa and korea as well as increased demand for our informatics offerings and invivo imaging systems in the research market this growth was partially offset by slight declines in our medical imaging business despite continued growth in our complementary metaloxidesemiconductor imaging technology as well as declines in our radiometric detection businesses within the research market as a result of sequestration concerns in the united states european austerity and weakening research markets in asia particularly in japan as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers we anticipate that the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease which can result in savings of longterm health care costs as well as create better outcomes for patients are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets 

in our environmental health segment our laboratory services business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time while reducing maintenance costs all of which continue to be critical for our customers during fiscal year 2013  we continued to experience growth in our laboratory services business by the addition of new customers to our onesource multivendor service offering partially offset by decreased demand across some of our products in the environmental and industrial markets we anticipate that the continued development of contaminant regulations and corresponding testing protocols will result in increased demand for efficient analytically sensitive and information rich testing solutions 

our consolidated gross margins decrease d 44  basis points in fiscal year 2013  as compared to fiscal year 2012  due to pricing pressure and unfavorable changes in product mix with an increase in sales of lower gross margin product offerings partially offset by the fiscal year 2013  marktomarket income  for our postretirement benefit plans as compared to the marktomarket loss  in fiscal year 2012  and productivity improvements our consolidated operating margin increase d 538  basis points in fiscal year 2013  as compared to fiscal year 2012  primarily due to lower pretax impairment charges of 67 million  in fiscal year 2013 as compared to 742 million  in fiscal year 2012 a pretax gain of 176 million  in fiscal year 2013 as compared to a pretax loss of 318 million  in fiscal year 2012 for the marktomarket adjustments for our postretirement plans and cost containment and productivity initiatives which were partially offset by higher restructuring costs and lower gross margins 

we believe we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the spending trends in our end markets and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services overall we believe that our strategic focus on human health and environmental health coupled with our breadth of end markets deep portfolio of technologies and applications leading market positions global scale and financial strength will provide us with a foundation for growth

during the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 our management approved a plan to realign operations and production resources as a result of previous acquisitions the “q1 2012 plan” as a result of the q1 2012 plan and during fiscal year 2012 we recognized a 54 million  pretax restructuring charge in our human health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space and recognized a 10 million  pretax restructuring charge in our environmental health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities during fiscal year 2013  we recorded a pretax restructuring reversal of 04 million  in our human health segment and a pretax restructuring reversal of 01 million  in our environmental health segment due to lower than expected costs associated with remaining severance payments 

  

as part of the q1 2012 plan we reduced headcount by 112  employees all employees were notified of termination and actions related to the closure of excess facility space were completed by april 1 2012 and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of 01 million  for workforce reductions will be substantially completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 the closure of the excess facility space will not require any additional payments

previous restructuring and integration plans 

the principal actions of the restructuring and integration plans from fiscal years 2001 through 2011  were workforce reductions related to the integration of our businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both our human health and environmental health segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and end markets that are more consistent with our growth strategy during fiscal year 2013  we paid 24 million  related to these plans and recorded a reversal of 11 million  primarily related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions within each of our human health and environmental health segments as of december 29 2013  we had 75 million  of remaining liabilities associated with these restructuring and integration plans primarily for residual lease obligations related to closed facilities and remaining severance payments for workforce reductions in both our human health and environmental health segments we expect to make payments for these leases the terms of which vary in length through fiscal year 2022 

contract termination charges 

we have terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges to the extent applicable for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us we recorded an additional pretax charge of 07 million  in fiscal year 2013  a pretax charge of 15 million  in fiscal year 2012  and a pretax charge of 20 million  in fiscal year 2011  primarily as a result of terminating various contractual commitments in our environmental health segment we made payments for these obligations of 10 million  during fiscal year 2013  29 million  during fiscal year 2012  and 04 million  during fiscal year 2011  the remaining balance of these accruals as of december 29 2013  was 03 million

discontinued operations 

as part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have discontinued certain businesses we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly have presented the results of operations and 

related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented any remaining liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 29 2013  and december 30 2012  

  

we recorded the following pretax gains and losses which have been reported as a gain or loss on disposition of discontinued operations during the three fiscal years ended 

  



  

in june 2010 we sold our photoflash business which was included in our environmental health segment for 135 million  including an adjustment for net working capital plus potential additional contingent consideration we recognized a pretax gain of 05 million  in fiscal year 2013  and a pretax gain of 25 million  in fiscal year 2012  for contingent consideration related to this sale 

  

in august 1999 we sold the assets of our technical service business for approximately 2500 million  in cash and the assumption by us of certain liabilities of our technical services business during fiscal year 2013 we recorded a pretax loss of 21 million  for a contingency related to this business

business combinations 

acquisitions in fiscal year 2013 

we completed the acquisition of four businesses for total consideration of 114 million  in cash as of the closing dates we potentially had to pay additional contingent consideration for the four acquired businesses of up to 22 million  which at closing had an estimated fair value of 11 million  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of each of the acquired businesses net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforce acquired and has been allocated to goodwill none of which is tax deductible we reported the operations for these acquisitions within the results of our operations from the acquisition dates as of december 29 2013 the purchase accounting allocations related to these acquisitions were preliminary 

  

acquisitions in fiscal year 2012 

acquisition of haoyuan biotech co ltd in november 2012 we acquired all outstanding stock of haoyuan haoyuan is a provider of nucleic acidbased blood screening solutions for the blood banking and clinical diagnostics markets we expect this acquisition to extend our capabilities into nucleic acid blood screening as well as deepen our position in the growing molecular clinical diagnostics market in china we paid the shareholders of haoyuan 380 million  in cash for the stock of haoyuan we recorded a receivable of 27 million  from the shareholders of haoyuan as a reduction of purchase price for the settlement of certain contingencies as of the closing date we potentially had to pay the shareholders additional contingent consideration of up to 300 million  which at closing had an estimated fair value of 19 million  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforce acquired and has been allocated to goodwill none of which is 

tax deductible we reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our human health segment from the acquisition date 

  

we do not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2013 and 2012  to be material to our consolidated results of operations therefore we are not presenting pro forma financial information of operations the aggregate revenue and results of operations for the acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 for the period from their respective acquisition dates to december 29 2013 and december 30 2012 were minimal we have also determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of those acquisitions from the date of acquisition is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition 

  

as of december 29 2013  the purchase price allocation for the haoyuan acquisition was final the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2013 were based upon an initial valuation our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuation are subject to change within the measurement period which is up to one year from the acquisition date the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances and residual goodwill we expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date during the measurement period during the measurement period we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date adjustments to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price during the measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements the effect of adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price made during the measurement period would be as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date the effects of any such adjustments if material may cause changes in depreciation amortization or other income or expense recognized in prior periods all changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement period are included in current period earnings 

  

allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period we may have to pay contingent consideration related to all acquisitions with open contingency periods of up to 313 million  as of december 29 2013  as of december 29 2013  we had recorded contingent consideration obligations relating to our acquisitions of dexela limited haoyuan and tetra teknolojik sistemler limited sirketi with an estimated fair value of 49 million  the earnout periods for each of these acquisitions do not exceed three  years from the acquisition date if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of definitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed 

  

in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin thereon the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services we do not include any costs associated with selling effort research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs in most acquisitions profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition the sum of the costs and operating income approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a thirdparty to assume the obligation 

  

contingencies including tax matters 

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated during fiscal year 2013 we accrued an additional 57 million  related to a particular site for increased monitoring and mitigation activities of which 46 million  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 we have accrued 135 million  as of december 29 2013  which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc collectively “enzo” filed a complaint dated october 23 2002 in the united states district court for the southern district of new york civil action no 028448 seeking injunctive and monetary relief against amersham plc amersham biosciences perkinelmer inc perkinelmer life sciences inc sigmaaldrich corporation sigma chemical company inc molecular probes inc and orchid biosciences inc the complaint alleges that we breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo infringed enzo’s patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against enzo by among other things engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo’s patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants we filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo’s patents are invalid in 2007 after the court issued a decision in 2006 regarding the construction of the claims in enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and we believe excluded certain of our products from the coverage of enzo’s patents summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants the case was assigned to a new district court judge in january 2009 and in march 2009 the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decided enzo’s appeal of the judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut in enzo biochem vs applera corp and tropix inc the “connecticut case” which involved a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of enzo’s case against us in march 2010 the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmedinpart and reversedinpart the judgment in the connecticut case the district court permitted us and the other defendants to jointly file a motion for summary judgment on certain patent and other issues common to all of the defendants on september 12 2012 the court granted in part and denied in part our motion for summary judgment of noninfringement on december 21 2012 we filed a second motion for summary judgment on claims that were not addressed in the first motion which the court also granted in part and denied in part the case is expected to go to trial in march 2014 

  

we believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above and we are contesting the action vigorously while this matter is subject to uncertainty in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

various tax years after 2006  remain open to examination by certain tax jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such as china finland germany italy netherlands singapore the united kingdom and the united states the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at december 29 2013  should not have a material adverse effect 

on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

financing lease obligations in september 2012 we entered into agreements with the lessors of buildings that we are currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings we provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings which resulted in us being considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period at the end of the construction period we will not be reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs we are therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases will qualify as financing leases under saleleaseback accounting guidance representing debt obligations for us and noncash investing and financing activities as a result we capitalized 293 million  in property and equipment net representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt we have also capitalized 115 million  in additional construction costs necessary to complete the renovations to the buildings which were funded by the lessors with a corresponding increase to debt at december 29 2013  we had 403 million  recorded for these financing lease obligations of which 26 million  was recorded as shortterm debt and 377 million  was recorded as longterm debt at december 30 2012  we had 346 million  recorded for these financing lease obligations of which 17 million  was recorded as shortterm debt and 329 million  was recorded as longterm debt the buildings are being depreciated on a straightline basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values which will equal the remaining financing obligation at the end of the lease term at the end of the lease term the remaining balances in property plant and equipment net and debt will be reversed against each other

capital expenditures 

during fiscal year 2014  we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2013  primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

at december 29 2013  we had cash and cash equivalents of 1732 million  of which 1686 million  was held by our nonus subsidiaries and we had 2910 million  of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility we had no other liquid investments at december 29 2013  

  

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed of the 1686 million  of cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries at december 29 2013  we would incur us taxes on approximately 1450 million  if transferred to the us without proper planning we expect the remaining accumulated nonus cash balances that may not be transferred to the us without incurring us taxes will remain outside of the us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows use of us cash balances external borrowings or some combination of these sources 

  

on october 24 2012 our board authorized us to repurchase up to 60 million  shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program the repurchase program will expire on october 24 2014 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2013  we repurchased approximately 36 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 1230 million  including commissions under the repurchase program as of december 29 2013  approximately 24 million  shares authorized by our board under the repurchase program remained available for repurchase

the repurchased shares have been reflected as a reduction in shares outstanding but remain available to be reissued with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in 

connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability creating increased volatility in security prices widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

  

our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets with respect to plans outside of the united states we expect to contribute 111 million  in the aggregate during fiscal year 2014  we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans during fiscal year 2013  we made contributions of 370 million  for the 2012 plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states during fiscal year 2013  we contributed 202 million  in the aggregate to plans outside of the united states which includes an additional contribution of 100 million  to our defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom during fiscal year 2012  we made a contribution of 170 million  for the 2011 plan year to our defined benefit pension plans in the united states and 109 million  in the aggregate to our defined benefit pension plans outside of the united states we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans

effects of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

  

during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 we adopted new guidance on additional disclosure requirements of other comprehensive income this new guidance requires the presentation of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements or as a separate disclosure in the notes to the financial statements the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into net income were not material for fiscal years 2013 2012 or 2011 see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional details 

  

effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates we believe that the impact of recently issued pronouncements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition warranty costs bad debts inventories accounting for business combinations and dispositions longlived assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other 

postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for products that include installation and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete for revenue that includes customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue after the acceptance criteria have been met certain of our products require specialized installation revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as services are rendered 

  

in limited circumstances we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component such as cord blood processing and storage for these arrangements the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a sellingprice hierarchy a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis a delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting the selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe if such evidence is available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and managements best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available tpe is the price of our or any competitors largely interchangeable products or services in standalone sales to similarlysituated customers besp is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis considering market conditions and entityspecific factors 

  

revenue from software licenses and services was 5  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2013  3  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2012  and 2  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2011  we sell our software licenses with maintenance services and in some cases also with consulting services for the undelivered elements we determine vsoe of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately we determine vsoe for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the amount that was separately charged for the maintenance renewal period we determine vsoe for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements when a software license sale is not involved 

  

we recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance andor consulting services upon shipment using the residual method provided that the above criteria have been met if vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered or if the only undelivered element is maintenance then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period 

  

the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings accounts are writtenoff only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted 

  

inventory valuation we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase andor manufacture we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for 

excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

  

business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest inprocess research and development “iprd” is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed 

value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the nonamortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a nonamortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized   in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite the assets will be tested for impairment these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 

through fiscal year 2013  we conducted annual goodwill impairment assessments for our reporting units analytical sciences and laboratory services diagnostics life sciences technology and medical imaging we completed the annual goodwill impairment test using measurement dates of january 1 2013  and january 2 2012 and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment at january 1 2013 the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 300  for each reporting unit while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future as part of integrating our recent acquisitions in fiscal year 2012 we decided that prospectively we would primarily focus on the perkinelmer trade name accordingly we undertook a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy which resulted in pretax impairment charges of 742 million  in fiscal year 2012 we concluded that the impairment for trade names was not a triggering event for goodwill because the impairment occurred as a result of our decision to phase out certain trade names we do not believe that our future cash flows will be significantly impacted by these changes during fiscal year 2013 we recorded a charge of 67 million  for the impairment of certain longlived assets within our human health segment as the carrying amounts of the longlived assets were not recoverable and exceeded their fair value we recorded a charge of 30 million  for the impairment of intangible assets during fiscal year 2011 within our human health segment for the full impairment of license agreements that we no longer intend to use these noncash impairments of longlived assets including intangible assets have been recorded as a separate component of operating expenses 

  

employee compensation and benefits we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement 

  

we recognized income  of 182 million  in fiscal year 2013  a loss  of 353 million  in fiscal year 2012  and a loss  of 750 million  in fiscal year 2011  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans which includes the charge for the marktomarket adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans which generally is recorded in the fourth quarter the gain or expense related to the marktomarket adjustment on postretirement benefit plans was a pretax income  of 176 million  in fiscal year 2013  a pretax loss  of 318 million  in fiscal year 2012  and a pretax loss  of 679 million  in fiscal year 2011  we expect expenses of approximately 17 million  in fiscal year 2014  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans excluding the charge for or benefit from the marktomarket adjustment it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a marktomarket adjustment in fiscal year 2014  marktomarket adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control including changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease markto market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2014  conversely to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected markto market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2014  pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year 

as of december 29 2013  we estimate the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our pension portfolios in the united states to be 725  and to be 530  for all plans outside the united states in addition as of december 29 2013  we estimate the discount rate for our pension portfolios in the united states to be 477  and to be 377  for all plans outside the united states we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date 

if any of our assumptions were to change as of december 29 2013  our pension plan expenses would also change 

  



  

we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

  

restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and iii impairment of assets as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled “restructuring and contract termination charges net” 

  

dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the fiscal year ended december 29 2013  we recorded 18 million  in pretax loss es from the disposition of discontinued operations any such changes decrease or increase current earnings 

  

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

  

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

  

additionally we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards state income tax credit carryforwards and certain foreign tax attributes valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision 

  

taxes have not been provided on unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries that we consider indefinitely reinvested because we plan to keep these amounts indefinitely reinvested overseas except for instances where we can remit such earnings to the us without an associated net tax cost our indefinite reinvestment determination is based on the future operational and capital requirements as of december 29 2013  the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the us indefinitely and for which no us tax cost has been provided was approximately 6070 million  it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments derivatives marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december 29 2013  

  

we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments by nature all financial instruments involve market and credit risks we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments approximately 60  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies therefore the fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing investing and operating the business 

  

in the ordinary course of business we may enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily denominated in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12  months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings 

  

principal hedged currencies include the british pound euro japanese yen and singapore dollar we held forward foreign exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges with us equivalent notional amounts totaling 1384 million  at december 29 2013  and 643 million  at december 30 2012  and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material the duration of these contracts was generally 30  days or less during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011  

  

as of december 29 2013  we had no  cash flow hedges outstanding and as of december 30 2012  we had two  outstanding cash flow hedges during fiscal year 2012 we entered into two forward foreign exchange contracts with settlement dates in fiscal year 2013 and combined euro denominated notional amounts of €500 million  designated as cash flow hedges during fiscal year 2013 we settled these euro denominated forward foreign exchange contracts the derivative gains were amortized into interest and other expense net when the hedged exposures affected interest and other expense net such amounts were not material for fiscal year 2013 

in may 2008 we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million  upon the issuance of our 2015 notes and recognized 84 million  net of taxes of 54 million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income during each of fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011  we amortized a pretax loss of 20 million  into interest and other expense net in addition during fiscal year 2013 we redeemed all of our 2015 notes and recognized a pretax loss of 28 million  for the remaining unamortized derivative losses into interest and other expense net 

  

market risk 

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 60  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in natural hedges 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95  confidence interval and a holding period of 30  days as of december 29 2013  this computation estimated that there is a 5  chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 06 million  this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2013  the valueatrisk ranged between 04 million  and 10 million  with an average of approximately 06 million  

  

interest rate risk as described above in “item 7 liquidity and capital resources” our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

  

in may 2008  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million  upon the issuance of our 2015 notes and recognized 84 million  net of taxes of 54 million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income during each of fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011  we amortized a pretax loss of 20 million  into interest and other expense net in addition during fiscal year 2013 we redeemed all of our 2015 notes and recognized a pretax loss of 28 million  for the remaining unamortized derivative losses into interest and other expense net 

interest rate risk—sensitivity  as of december 29 2013  our debt portfolio consisted of 3970 million  of variable rate debt in addition our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 1732 million  at december 29 2013  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

i changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt consisting of 3970 million  of revolving debt facilities to fluctuate an increase of 10  or approximately 15  basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pretax charge to our earnings of 06 million  for fiscal year 2014  

  

ii changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate as described above an increase of 10  or approximately 15  basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 06 million  for fiscal year 2014  

  

iii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2013  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in the 1992  internal controlintegrated framework 

based on this assessment our management concluded that as of december 29 2013  our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

our registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting this report appears below 

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of perkinelmer inc 

waltham massachusetts 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of perkinelmer inc and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 29 2013  based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2013  based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework 1992  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 29 2013  of the company and our report dated february 25 2014  expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

recent developments 

as part of our strategy to grow our core businesses we have recently taken the following actions 

strategic business realignment 

we announced a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year 2013 that will allow us to implement our strategy and propel our vision to improve global health by innovating technologies that help make healthcare more effective affordable and accessible around the world our field service for products previously sold by our former biodiscovery business as well as our informatics business will be moved from our environmental health segment into our human health segment we will report our financial results beginning in fiscal year 2013 using this new alignment under our human health and environmental health segments 

business combination 

acquisition of haoyuan biotech co ltd in november 2012 we acquired all outstanding stock of shanghai haoyuan biotech co ltd haoyuan haoyuan is a provider of nucleic acidbased blood screening solutions for the blood banking and clinical diagnostics markets we expect this acquisition to extend our capabilities into nucleic acid blood screening as well as deepen our position in the growing molecular clinical diagnostics market in china we paid the shareholders of haoyuan 380 million  in cash for the stock of haoyuan we recorded a receivable of 27 million  from the shareholders of haoyuan as a reduction of purchase price for the settlement of certain contingencies as of the closing date we potentially had to pay the shareholders additional contingent consideration of up to 300 million  which at closing had an estimated fair value of 19 million  we reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our human health segment from the acquisition date 

restructuring 

during fiscal year 2012  we recorded a 168 million  pretax restructuring charge in our human health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities the closure of excess facility space and contract termination costs we also recognized a 74 million  pretax restructuring charge in our environmental health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and contract termination costs our management approved these plans principally to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets to realign operations and production resources as a result of recent acquisitions and to shift resources to a newly established shared service center we also recorded an additional pretax restructuring charge  of 03 million  primarily related to higher than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in europe within the human health segment as well as an additional reversal  of 09 million  primarily related to a reduction in the estimated sublease rental payments reasonably expected to be obtained for an excess facility in europe within the environmental health segment we also recorded a pretax charge of 15 million  during fiscal year 2012  primarily as a result of terminating various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities in our environmental health segment the pretax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring expenses and is included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect the impact of immediate cost savings from these restructuring plans on operating results and cash flows to approximately offset the increased spending required to realign operations we expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows will exceed 110 million  on an annual basis beginning in fiscal year 2014 primarily as decreases to cost of revenue and selling general and administrative expenses 

  

as part of our ongoing business strategy we also took the following action 

share repurchase program   

on october 23 2008 we announced that our board of directors our board authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million  shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the “repurchase program” on august 31 2010 we announced that our board had authorized us to repurchase an additional 50 million  shares of common stock under the repurchase program the repurchase program expired on october 22 2012 on october 24 2012 our board authorized us to repurchase up to 60 million  shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program the new repurchase program the new repurchase program will expire on october 24 2014 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2012  we did not repurchase any shares of common stock under either of the stock repurchase programs during fiscal year 2011  we repurchased approximately 40 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 1078 million  including commissions under the repurchase program during fiscal year 2010  we repurchased approximately 30 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 715 million  including commissions under the repurchase program as of december 30 2012  all 60 million  shares authorized by our board under the new repurchase program remained available for repurchase from december 31 2012 through february 22 2013  we repurchased approximately 26 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 890 million  including commissions under the new repurchase program 

  

business segments and products 

we report our business in two segments human health and environmental health we performed our annual impairment testing on january 2 2012  the annual impairment date for our reporting units and based on the first step of the impairment process the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment 

  

we announced a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year 2013 that will allow us to implement our strategy and propel our vision to improve global health by innovating technologies that help make healthcare more effective affordable and accessible around the world our field service for products previously sold by our former biodiscovery business as well as our informatics business will be moved from our environmental health segment into our human health segment we will report our financial results beginning in fiscal year 2013 using this new alignment under our human health and environmental health segments

marketing 

all of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces as of december 30 2012  we employed approximately 3500  sales and service representatives operating in approximately 33  countries and marketing products and services in more than 150  countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials key components and supplies 

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with certain of our suppliers for certain critical raw materials key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components see the applicable risk factor in “item 1a risk factors” for an additional description of this risk 

  

intellectual property 

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties we are currently involved in a lawsuit involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights see “item 3 legal proceedings” for a discussion of this matter 

  

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

due to the wide range of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors this affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation operational efficiency product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market niches we expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

we believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition 

  

research and development 

research and development expenditures were approximately 1326 million  during fiscal year 2012  approximately 1158 million  during fiscal year 2011  and approximately 948 million  during fiscal year 2010  

  

we directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010  primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental industrial and laboratory services markets within our environmental health segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives we expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2013  and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental industrial and laboratory services markets within our environmental health segment 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing uses emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 61 million  as of december 30 2012  which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of the ultimate remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

in addition during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 we settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred at our facility in boston massachusetts in march 2005 in fiscal year 2007 we accrued 97 million  representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building including environmental matters which was damaged in the fire we paid 25 million  during fiscal year 2009 16 million  during fiscal year 2008 and 39 million  during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building we sold the building on april 27 2010 net proceeds from the sale were 110 million  and we recorded a pretax gain of 34 million  in operating income 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

as of december 30 2012  we employed approximately 7500  employees in our continuing operations several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of december 30 2012  we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately 1600  union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 

financial information about reporting segments 

we have included the expenses for our corporate headquarters such as legal tax audit human resources information technology and other management and compliance costs as well as the expense related to marktomarket on postretirement benefit plans as “corporate” below we have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses these amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our reporting segments 

  

the table below sets forth revenue and operating income loss excluding discontinued operations by reporting segment for the fiscal years ended 

  



 

   

 

additional information relating to our reporting segments is as follows for the fiscal years ended 

  



  



financial information about geographic areas 

both of our reporting segments conduct business in and derive substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during fiscal year 2012  we had 12923 million  in sales from our international operations representing approximately 60  of our total sales during fiscal year 2012  we derived approximately 41  of our international sales from our human health segment and approximately 59  of our international sales from our environmental health segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future 

  

we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements additional geographic information is discussed in note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding restrictions in capital expenditures general economic conditions cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our 

consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

our growth is subject to global economic and political conditions and operational disruptions at our facilities 

we have operations in many parts of the world while the global economy began showing signs of gradual improvement in 2010 from its significant downturn in 2008 and 2009 debt and equity markets experienced renewed disruption beginning early in the third quarter of 2011 including the downgrading of government issued debt in the united states and other countries and the prospects of an economic recovery remain uncertain particularly as the united states and other countries continue to balance concerns around debt inflation growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives there can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be sustainable or that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows results of operations financial position or our ability to access capital our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location 

while we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities a major earthquake fire flood power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

certain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments or other measures and some of these risks are insurable but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

 many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable or successfully divest businesses 

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our acquisition of haoyuan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and caliper in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons such as 

 some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences loss of key personnel unforeseen regulatory requirements previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results additionally if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies which may adversely impact our profitability 

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies the expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs as a result small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

 a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the united states postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products 

could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

the manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries if we fail to comply with those regulations we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions some of the products produced by our human health segment are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales resales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar foreign and domestic agencies we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2012  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and scientists and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems software and technologies successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

we have a substantial amount of outstanding debt which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business 

our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 in addition we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility our 6 senior unsecured notes due 2015 the “2015 notes” and our 5 senior unsecured notes due 2021 the 2021 notes include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company these include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

 we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments 

any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility our 2015 notes our 2021 notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances 

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

as of december 30 2012  our total assets included 27 billion  of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights core technology and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets 

adverse changes in our business adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units or the failure to grow our human health and environmental health segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our share price will fluctuate 

over the last several quarters stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 

 dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

on january 25 2013  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012  that will be payable in may 2013  in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

legal proceedings 

tableend   

enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc collectively “enzo” filed a complaint dated october 23 2002 in the united states district court for the southern district of new york civil action no 028448 seeking injunctive and monetary relief against amersham plc amersham biosciences perkinelmer inc perkinelmer life sciences inc sigmaaldrich corporation sigma chemical company inc molecular probes inc and orchid biosciences inc the complaint alleges that we breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo infringed enzos patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against enzo by among other things engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzos patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants we filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzos patents are invalid in 2007 after the court issued a decision in 2006 regarding the construction of the claims in enzos patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and we believe excluded certain of our products from the coverage of enzos patents summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants 

the case was assigned to a new district court judge in january 2009 and in march 2009 the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decided enzos appeal of the judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut in enzo biochem vs applera corp and tropix inc the “connecticut case” which involved a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of enzos case against us in march 2010 the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmedinpart and reversedinpart the judgment in the connecticut case the district court permitted us and the other defendants to jointly file a motion for summary judgment on certain patent and other issues common to all of the defendants on september 12 2012 the court granted in part and denied in part our motion for summary judgment of noninfringement on december 21 2012 we filed a second motion for summary judgment on claims that were not addressed in the first motion the second motion is pending the district court has permitted enzo to take limited discovery directed to the motion with briefing to be concluded in may 2013 

we believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above and we are contesting the action vigorously while this matter is subject to uncertainty in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at december 30 2012  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

overview of fiscal year 2012   

during fiscal year 2012  we continued to see good performance from acquisitions investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives our overall revenue in fiscal year 2012   increase d 1967 million  or 10  as compared to fiscal year 2011  reflecting an increase  of 1597 million  or 18  in our human health segment revenue and an increase  of 370 million  or 4  in our environmental health segment revenue the increase  in our human health segment revenue during fiscal year 2012  was due to growth in the research market including the addition of caliper life sciences inc caliper as well as growth generated from both our screening and our medical imaging businesses within the diagnostics market the increase  in our environmental health segment revenue during fiscal year 2012  was due to growth in our informatics offerings within the laboratory services market and growth from our environmental food and consumer safety and testing products partially offset by decreased demand for our applications in the industrial markets 

in our human health segment during fiscal year 2012  as compared to fiscal year 2011  we experienced growth in the research market due to continued demand for our invivo imaging systems with the addition of caliper imaging systems as well as increased demand for our janus ®  automation tools and our operetta ®  cellular imaging systems the growth in the research market was partially offset by reduced sales to pharmaceutical companies resulting from reduced research and development spending as well as a decline in demand for our suite of radioactive reagents particularly in europe and japan we also experienced growth in the diagnostics market as birth rates in the united states continue to stabilize and from continued expansion of our prenatal newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the united states particularly in emerging markets such as china in our medical imaging business we had continued growth from our traditional diagnostic imaging offerings as well as increased demand for our complementary metaloxidesemiconductor “cmos” imaging technology particularly in the fields of mammography dental and orthopedics as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers we anticipate that the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease which can result in savings of longterm health care costs as well as creating better outcomes for patients are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets 

in our environmental health segment our laboratory services business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time while reducing maintenance costs all of which continue to be critical for our customers during fiscal year 2012  we had increased demand for our informatics offerings and we continued to grow our laboratory services business by adding new customers to our onesource multivendor service offering sales of environmental food and consumer safety and testing products also grew in fiscal year 2012  as compared to fiscal year 2011  as increased regulations in environmental and food safety markets continued to drive demand for our analytical instrumentation and followon consumables particularly in china and south america we saw continued strength in our inorganic analysis solutions such as our nexion ®  mass spectrometer as trace metals identification remains a critical component of contaminant detection for environmental as well as food and consumer safety applications these increases were partially offset by decreased demand for our applications in the industrial markets we believe these trends will continue as emerging contaminant testing protocols and corresponding regulations are developed resulting in continued demand for efficient analytically sensitive and information rich testing solutions 

our consolidated gross margins increase d 135  basis points in fiscal year 2012  as compared to fiscal year 2011  due to the lower fiscal year 2012  marktomarket charge for our postretirement benefit plans increased sales volume changes in product mix with growth in sales of higher gross margin product offerings and productivity improvements our consolidated operating 

margin decrease d 9  basis points in fiscal year 2012  as compared to fiscal year 2011  primarily due to the fiscal year 2012  pretax impairment charges of 742 million  as a result of a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy and increased costs related to growth and productivity investments partially offset by a lower fiscal year 2012  marktomarket charge for our postretirement benefit plans higher gross margins and cost containment and productivity initiatives 

we believe we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the stable spending trends in our end markets and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services overall we believe that our strategic focus on human health and environmental health coupled with our breadth of end markets deep portfolio of technologies and applications leading market positions global scale and financial strength will provide us with a strong foundation for continued growth

we do not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2012 and 2011  with the exception of the caliper acquisition to be material to our consolidated results of operations therefore we are not presenting pro forma financial information of operations the aggregate revenue and results of operations for haoyuan for the period from the acquisition date to december 30 2012  were minimal the aggregate revenue for the acquisitions with the exception of caliper completed during fiscal year 2011  for the period from their respective acquisition dates to january 1 2012  was 324 million  we have also determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of those acquisitions from the date of acquisition is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition 

  

allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date based on revenue thresholds or product development milestones achieved through given dates with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period we may have to pay contingent consideration related to all acquisitions with open contingency periods of up to 613 million  as of december 30 2012  as of december 30 2012  we had recorded contingent consideration obligations relating to our acquisitions of dexela and haoyuan with an estimated fair value of 30 million  the earnout periods for each of these acquisitions do not exceed three  years from the acquisition date if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of definitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed 

  

in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin thereon the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services we do not include any costs associated with selling effort research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs in most acquisitions profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition the sum of the costs and operating income approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a thirdparty to assume the obligation 

  

as of december 30 2012  with the exception of the purchase price allocation for the haoyuan acquisition the purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2012 and 2011  were final the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the haoyuan acquisition was based upon an initial valuation and our estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuation are subject to change within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances and residual goodwill we expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date during the measurement period during the measurement period we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date adjustments to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price during the measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements the effect of any measurement period adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price made during the measurement period would be as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date the effects of such adjustments if material will cause changes in depreciation amortization or other income or expense recognized in prior periods all changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement period are included in current period earnings 

contingencies including tax matters 

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 61 million  as of december 30 2012  which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of the ultimate remediation of known environmental matters and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any 

additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc collectively “enzo” filed a complaint dated october 23 2002 in the united states district court for the southern district of new york civil action no 028448 seeking injunctive and monetary relief against amersham plc amersham biosciences perkinelmer inc perkinelmer life sciences inc sigmaaldrich corporation sigma chemical company inc molecular probes inc and orchid biosciences inc the complaint alleges that we breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo infringed enzo’s patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against enzo by among other things engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo’s patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants we filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo’s patents are invalid in 2007 after the court issued a decision in 2006 regarding the construction of the claims in enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and we believe excluded certain of our products from the coverage of enzo’s patents summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants the case was assigned to a new district court judge in january 2009 and in march 2009 the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decided enzo’s appeal of the judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut in enzo biochem vs applera corp and tropix inc the “connecticut case” which involved a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of enzo’s case against us in march 2010 the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmedinpart and reversedinpart the judgment in the connecticut case the district court permitted us and the other defendants to jointly file a motion for summary judgment on certain patent and other issues common to all of the defendants on september 12 2012 the court granted in part and denied in part our motion for summary judgment of noninfringement on december 21 2012 we filed a second motion for summary judgment on claims that were not addressed in the first motion the second motion is pending the district court has permitted enzo to take limited discovery directed to the motion with briefing to be concluded in may 2013 

  

we believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above and we are contesting the action vigorously while this matter is subject to uncertainty in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

tax years after 2005  remain open to examination by various tax jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such as singapore china finland germany netherlands the united kingdom italy and the united states the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at december 30 2012  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

financing activities  net cash provided by the financing activities of our continuing operations was 3991 million  for fiscal year 2011  as compared to net cash used in the financing activities of our continuing operations of 2155 million  for fiscal year 2010  an increase  of 6146 million  for fiscal year 2011  we repurchased 40 million  shares of our common stock including 84243  shares of our common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards for a total cost of 1100 million  including commissions this compares to repurchases of 30 million  shares of our common stock including 57551  shares of our common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards for a total cost of 728 million  including commissions for fiscal year 2010  this use of cash in fiscal year 2011  was partially offset by proceeds from common stock option exercises of 331 million  including 93 million  for the related excess tax benefit this compares to the proceeds from common stock option exercises of 314 million  including 24 million  for the related excess tax benefit for fiscal year 2010  during fiscal year 2011  debt borrowings from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility totaled 7870 million  with additional net proceeds of 4969 million  from the issuance of our tenyear senior unsecured notes at a rate of 5  which was partially offset by debt reductions of 7630 million  this compares to debt borrowings from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of 3680 million  which was offset by debt reductions of 5088 million  during fiscal year 2010  we paid 318 million  and 330 million  in dividends during fiscal years 2011 and 2010  respectively we paid 105 million  for debt issuance 

costs during fiscal year 2011  in addition we settled 01 million  in contingent consideration recorded at the acquisition date fair value for acquisitions completed subsequent to fiscal year 2008 during both fiscal years 2011 and 2010  

  

borrowing arrangements 

senior unsecured revolving credit facility on december 16 2011 we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility which provides for 7000 million  of revolving loans and has an initial maturity of december 16 2016  as of december 30 2012  undrawn letters of credit in the aggregate amount of 123 million  were treated as issued and outstanding under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 30 2012  we had 4297 million  available for additional borrowing under the facility we use the senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes which may include working capital refinancing existing indebtedness capital expenditures share repurchases acquisitions and strategic alliances the interest rates under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin or the base rate from time to time the base rate is the higher of i the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by bank of america na as its prime rate ii the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or iii onemonth libor plus 100 the eurocurrency margin as of december 30 2012  was 130  basis points the weighted average eurocurrency interest rate as of december 30 2012  was 021  resulting in a weighted average effective eurocurrency rate including the margin of 151  which is the interest applicable to borrowings outstanding under the eurocurrency rate as of december 30 2012  we had 2580 million  and 2980 million  of borrowings in us dollars outstanding under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 30 2012  and january 1 2012  respectively with interest based primarily on the above described eurocurrency rate the credit agreement for the facility contains affirmative negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type and similar to those contained in the credit agreement for our previous facility the financial covenants in our amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility include a debttocapital ratio and two contingent covenants a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio applicable if our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december 30 2012  

  

6  senior unsecured notes due 2015 on may 30 2008 we issued 1500 million  aggregate principal amount of 2015 notes in a private placement and received 1500 million  of proceeds from the issuance the 2015 notes mature in may 2015  and bear interest at an annual rate of 6  interest on the 2015 notes is payable semiannually on may 30th and november 30th each year we may redeem some or all of the 2015 notes at any time at our option at a makewhole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest the indenture governing the 2015 notes includes financial covenants of debttocapital ratios and a contingent multiple of total debt to earnings ratio applicable only if our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december 30 2012  

  

5  senior unsecured notes due 2021 on october 25 2011 we issued 5000 million  aggregate principal amount of 2021 notes in a registered public offering and received approximately 4969 million  of net proceeds from the issuance the 2021 notes were issued at 99372  of the principal amount which resulted in a discount of 31 million  the 2021 notes mature in november 2021  and bear interest at an annual rate of 5  interest on the 2021 notes is payable semiannually on may 15th and november 15th each year prior to august 15 2021 three months prior to their maturity date we may redeem the 2021 notes in whole or in part at our option at a redemption price equal to the greater of i 100 of the principal amount of the 2021 notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect to the 2021 notes being redeemed discounted on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate plus 45 basis points plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after august 15 2021 three months prior to their maturity date we may redeem the 2021 notes at our option at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2021 notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest upon a change of control as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 notes  and a contemporaneous downgrade of the 2021 notes below investment grade each holder of 2021 notes will have the right to require us to repurchase such holders 2021 notes for 101  of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december 30 2012  

financing lease obligations in september 2012 we entered into agreements with the lessors of buildings that we are currently occupying and leasing to expand those buildings we provided a portion of the funds needed for the construction of the additions to the buildings which resulted in us being considered the owner of the buildings during the construction period at the end of the construction period we will not be reimbursed by the lessors for all of the construction costs we are therefore deemed to have continuing involvement and the leases will qualify as financing leases under saleleaseback accounting guidance representing debt obligations for us and noncash investing and financing activities as a result we capitalized 293 million  in property and equipment net representing the fair value of the buildings with a corresponding increase to debt in addition we expect to capitalize additional construction costs which are not expected to exceed 150 million  and will be partially funded by the lessors to complete the additions to the buildings during fiscal year 2012  we recorded 55 million  of capital improvements to these buildings which have been funded by the lessor the buildings are being depreciated on a straightline basis over the terms of the leases to their estimated residual values which will equal the remaining financing 

obligation at the end of the lease term at the end of the lease term the remaining balances in property plant and equipment net and debt will be reversed against each other 

  

dividends 

our board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 007 per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2012 and 2011  resulting in an annual dividend rate of 028 per share on january 25 2013  we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007  per share that is payable in may 2013  in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 30 2012  for continuing and discontinued operations 

  



 

   

 purchase commitments are minimal and have been excluded from this table 

  

capital expenditures 

during fiscal year 2013  we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2012  primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures during fiscal year 2013  we also expect to record activity related to capital improvements under our financing lease obligations which are not expected to exceed 94 million  and will be partially funded by the lessors 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

at december 30 2012  we had cash and cash equivalents of 1714 million  and a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with 4297 million  available for additional borrowing under the facility 

  

most of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed as a result of the caliper acquisition we concluded in fiscal year 2011 that certain foreign operations did not require the same level of capital as previously expected and therefore we planned to repatriate approximately 3500 million  of previously unremitted earnings and have provided for the estimated taxes on the repatriation of those earnings as a result of the planned repatriation we recorded an increase to our tax provision of 797 million  in continuing operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 we expect to utilize tax attributes primarily those acquired in the caliper acquisition to minimize the cash taxes paid on the repatriation as of december 30 2012  we had remitted 2292 million  of the 3500 million  planned repatriation and we expect to remit the remainder of the planned repatriation amount by the end of fiscal year 2013 we expect accumulated nonus cash balances 

will remain outside of the us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows use of us cash balances external borrowings or some combination of these sources 

  

on october 23 2008 we announced that our board authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million  shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the “repurchase program” on august 31 2010 we announced that our board had authorized us to repurchase an additional 50 million  shares of common stock under the repurchase program the repurchase program expired on october 22 2012 on october 24 2012 our board authorized us to repurchase up to 60 million  shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program the new repurchase program the new repurchase program will expire on october 24 2014 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2012  we did not repurchase any shares of common stock under either of the stock repurchase programs during fiscal year 2011  we repurchased approximately 40 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 1078 million  including commissions under the repurchase program during fiscal year 2010  we repurchased approximately 30 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 715 million  including commissions under the repurchase program as of december 30 2012  approximately 60 million  shares authorized by our board under the new repurchase program remained available for repurchase from december 31 2012 through february 22 2013  we repurchased approximately 26 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 890 million  including commissions under the new repurchase program 

  

our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans during fiscal year 2012  we repurchased 82186  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 21 million  during fiscal year 2011  we repurchased 84243  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 22 million  during fiscal year 2010  we repurchased 57551  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 13 million  

the repurchased shares have been reflected as a reduction in shares outstanding but remain available to be reissued with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability creating increased volatility in security prices widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

  

our pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013  we made a contribution of 370 million  for the 2012 plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states with respect to plans outside of the united states we expect to contribute approximately 220 million  in the aggregate during fiscal year 2013  of which we contributed 100 million  to one of our foreign plans during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013  we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans during fiscal year 2012  we made a contribution of 170 million  for the 2011 plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states and 109 million  in the aggregate to our defined benefit pension plans outside of the united states during fiscal year 2011  we made contributions of 115 million  in the aggregate to our defined benefit pension plans outside of the united states we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans 

  

during the third quarter of fiscal year 2012  we entered into a strategic agreement under which we acquired certain intangible assets and received a license to certain core technology for an analytics and data discovery platform as well as the exclusive right to distribute the platform in certain scientific research and development markets during fiscal year 2012  we paid 68 million  for net intangible assets and 250 million  for prepaid royalties and expect to pay an additional 132 million  in prepaid royalties within the next year royalties are expected to be expensed as revenue is recognized 

  

effects of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

during the first quarter of fiscal year 2012  we adopted new guidance for certain of our health care businesses that recognize patient service revenue at the time the services are rendered where we do not assess the patients ability to pay at such 

time the new guidance requires us to present the provision for bad debts related to such revenue as a deduction from revenue net of contractual allowances and discounts on the statements of operations the effects of the adoption on our consolidated statements of operations were decreases to revenue with corresponding decreases to selling general and administrative expenses of 28 million  for fiscal year 2012  28 million  for fiscal year 2011  and 26 million  for fiscal year 2010  accordingly the financial data for all periods presented has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of these accounting changes 

  

effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates we believe that the impact of recently issued pronouncements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition warranty costs bad debts inventories accounting for business combinations and dispositions longlived assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for products that include installation and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete for revenue that includes customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue after the acceptance criteria have been met certain of our products require specialized installation revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as services are rendered 

  

in limited circumstances we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component such as cord blood processing and storage for these arrangements the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a sellingprice hierarchy a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis a delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting the selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe if such evidence is available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and managements best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available tpe is the price of our or any competitors largely interchangeable products or services in standalone sales to similarlysituated customers besp is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis considering market conditions and entityspecific factors 

  

revenue from software licenses and services was 3  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2012  2  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2011  and 1  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2010  we sell our software licenses with maintenance services and in some cases also with consulting services for the undelivered elements we determine vsoe of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately we determine vsoe for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the amount that was separately charged for the maintenance renewal period we determine vsoe for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements when a software license sale is not involved 

  

we recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance andor consulting services upon shipment using the residual method provided that the above criteria have been met if vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered or if the only undelivered element is maintenance then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period 

  

the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material costs incurred in the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings accounts are writtenoff only when all methods of recovery have been exhausted 

  

inventory valuation we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase andor manufacture we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

  

business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest inprocess research and development “iprd” is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed 

value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the nonamortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a nonamortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized   in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite the assets will be tested for impairment these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization as part of integrating our recent acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 we decided that prospectively we would primarily focus on the perkinelmer trade name accordingly we 

undertook a review of certain of our trade names within our portfolio as part of a realignment of our marketing strategy which resulted in pretax impairment charges of 742 million  in fiscal year 2012 we concluded that the impairment for trade names was not a triggering event for goodwill because the impairment occurred as a result of our decision to phase out certain trade names we do not believe that our future cash flows will be significantly impacted by these changes through fiscal year 2012  we assessed the annual impairment testing for our reporting units analytical sciences and laboratory services diagnostics life sciences technology and medical imaging we completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of january 2 2012  and january 3 2011 and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment and the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future 

  

employee compensation and benefits we sponsor both funded and unfunded us and nonus defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement 

  

we incurred expenses of 353 million  in fiscal year 2012  750 million  in fiscal year 2011  and 38 million  in fiscal year 2010  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans which includes the charge for the marktomarket adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans which generally is recorded in the fourth quarter the expense related to marktomarket on postretirement benefit plans was 318 million  in fiscal year 2012  679 million  in fiscal year 2011  and 02 million  in fiscal year 2010  we expect expenses of approximately 03 million  in fiscal year 2013  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans excluding the charge for or benefit from the marktomarket adjustment it is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a marktomarket adjustment in fiscal year 2013  marktomarket adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control including changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease markto market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2013  conversely to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected markto market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2013  pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year 

  as of december 30 2012  we estimate the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our pension portfolios in the united states to be 750  and to be 550  for all plans outside the united states in addition as of december 30 2012  we estimate the discount rate for our pension portfolios in the united states to be 390  and to be 362  for all plans outside the united states we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates corresponding with expected benefit payments at the measurement date 

if any of our assumptions were to change as of december 30 2012  our pension plan expenses would also change 

  



  

we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

  

restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and iii impairment of assets as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled “restructuring and contract termination charges net” 

  

dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the fiscal year ended december 30 2012  we recorded 24 million  in pretax gains from the disposition of discontinued operations any such changes decrease or increase current earnings 

  

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

  

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted which retroactively reinstated and extended the federal research and development tax credit federal rd tax credit from january 1 2012 to december 31 2013 as a result we expect our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 will include an approximate 13 million  discrete tax benefit relating to the previously unrecognized federal rd tax credits from january 1 2012 to december 31 2012 

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are 

periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

  

additionally we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards state income tax credit carryforwards and certain foreign tax attributes valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the future pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business changes in our assumptions regarding the appropriate amount for valuation allowances could result in the increase or decrease in the valuation allowance with a corresponding charge or benefit to our tax provision 

  

taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings that we continue to consider indefinitely reinvested the determination of which is based on our future operational and capital requirements we continue to maintain our indefinite reinvestment assertion with regards to the remaining unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore do not accrue us tax for the repatriation of the remaining unremitted foreign earnings as of december 30 2012  the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the us indefinitely and for which no us tax cost has been provided was approximately 4720 million  it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december 30 2012  

  

we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments by nature all financial instruments involve market and credit risks we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments approximately 60  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies therefore the fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing investing and operating the business 

  

in the ordinary course of business we may enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily denominated in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12  months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings 

  

principal hedged currencies include the british pound canadian dollar euro japanese yen and singapore dollar we held forward foreign exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges with us equivalent notional amounts totaling 643 million  at december 30 2012  and 2689 million  at january 1 2012  and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the duration of these contracts was generally 30  days or less during fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010  

  

as of december 30 2012  we had two  cash flow hedges outstanding and as of january 1 2012  we had no  outstanding cash flow hedges during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012  we entered into two forward foreign exchange contracts with settlement dates in fiscal year 2013  and combined euro denominated notional amounts of euro 500 million  designated as cash flow hedges the fair value of these currency derivative contracts at december 30 2012  was 01 million  in may 2008  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million  upon the issuance of our 2015 notes and recognized 84 million  net of taxes of 54 million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense as of december 30 2012  the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the effective cash flow hedges was 29 million  net of taxes of 19 million  we amortized 20 million  into interest expense during each of the fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010  

  

market risk 

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 60  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in natural hedges 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95  confidence interval and a holding period of 30  days as of december 30 2012  this computation estimated that there is a 5  chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 03 million  this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2012  the valueatrisk ranged between 02 million  and 05 million  with an average of approximately 03 million  

  

interest rate risk as described above our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

  

in may 2008  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million  upon the issuance of our 2015 notes and recognized 84 million  net of taxes of 54 million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense as of december 30 2012  the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the effective cash flow hedges was 29 million  net of taxes of 19 million  we amortized 20 million  into interest expense during each of the fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010  

interest rate risk—sensitivity  as of december 30 2012  our debt portfolio consisted of 2580 million  of variable rate debt in addition our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 1714 million  at december 30 2012  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

i changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt consisting of 2580 million  of revolving debt facilities to fluctuate an increase of 10  or approximately 15  basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pretax charge to our earnings of 04 million  for fiscal year 2013  

  

ii changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate as described above an increase of 10  or approximately 15  basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 04 million  for fiscal year 2013  

  

iii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 30 2012  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework 

based on this assessment our management concluded that as of december 30 2012  our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

our registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting this report appears below

to the board of directors and stockholders of perkinelmer inc 

waltham massachusetts 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of perkinelmer inc and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 30 2012  based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 30 2012  based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 30 2012  of the company and our report dated february 26 2013  expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

we recently took the following additional actions to further strengthen our core businesses 

  

restructuring 

during fiscal year 2011  we recorded a 56 million  pretax restructuring charge in our human health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities the closure of excess facility space and contract termination costs we also recognized an 81 million  pretax restructuring charge in our environmental health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space our management approved these plans principally to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets and to reduce resources in response to the continued economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain other end markets we also recorded a pretax restructuring reversal  of 03 million  relating to our previous restructuring plans due to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in europe within both our human health and environmental health segments partially offset by a reduction in the estimated sublease rental payments reasonably expected to be obtained for our excess facility space within both our human health and environmental health segments the pretax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring expenses and is included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect the impact of immediate cost savings from these restructuring plans on operating results and cash flows to approximately offset the increased spending in higher growth regions and the decline in revenue from certain products respectively we expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible as we will incur offsetting costs 

  

as part of our ongoing business strategy we also took the following action

brand names 

our environmental health segment offers additional products under various brand names including chromera™ hyperdsc ®  lambda™ labworks™ onesource ®  and spectrum™ 

  

marketing 

all of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces as of january 1 2012  we employed approximately 3300  sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35  countries and marketing products and services in more than 150  countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials key components and supplies 

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with certain of our suppliers for certain critical raw materials key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components see the applicable risk factor in “item 1a risk factors” for an additional description of this issue 

  

intellectual property 

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties we are currently involved in a lawsuit involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights see “item 3 legal proceedings” for a discussion of this matter 

  

backlog 

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

due to the wide range of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors this affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation operational efficiency product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market niches we expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

we believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition 

  

research and development 

research and development expenditures were approximately 1158 million  during fiscal year 2011  approximately 948 million  during fiscal year 2010  and approximately 905 million  during fiscal year 2009  

  

we directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009  primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental industrial and laboratory services markets within our environmental health segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives we expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2012  and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental industrial and laboratory services markets within our environmental health segment 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing uses emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 67 million  as of january 1 2012  which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

in addition during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 we settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred at our facility in boston massachusetts in march 2005 we accrued 97 million  representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building including environmental matters which was damaged in the fire we paid 25 million  during fiscal year 2009 16 million  during fiscal year 2008 and 39 million  during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building we sold the building on april 27 2010 net proceeds from the sale were 110 million  and we recorded a pretax gain of 34 million  in operating income 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

as of january 1 2012  we employed approximately 7200  employees in our continuing operations several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of january 1 2012  we employed an aggregate of approximately 840  union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 

financial information about reporting segments 

we have included the expenses for our corporate headquarters such as legal tax audit human resources information technology and other management and compliance costs as well as the expense related to marktomarket and curtailments on postretirement benefit plans as “corporate” below we have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses these amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our reporting segments 

  

the table below sets forth revenue and operating income loss excluding discontinued operations by reporting segment for the fiscal years ended 

  



 

   

additional information relating to our reporting segments is as follows for the fiscal years ended 

  



  



financial information about geographic areas 

both of our reporting segments conduct business in and derive substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during fiscal year 2011  we had 11927 million  in sales from our international operations representing approximately 62  of our total sales during fiscal year 2011  we derived approximately 38  of our international sales from our human health segment and approximately 62  of our international sales from our environmental health segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future 

  

we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements additional geographic information is discussed in note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

risk factors 

tableend   

the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding restrictions in capital expenditures general economic conditions cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

our growth is subject to global economic political and other risks 

we have operations in many parts of the world the global economy has a significant impact on our business the global economy experienced a significant downturn throughout 2008 and 2009 this downturn was caused in part by the effects of the credit market crisis and the resulting impact on the finance and banking industries volatile currency exchange rates and energy costs inflation concerns decreased consumer confidence reduced corporate profits and capital expenditures and liquidity concerns although the global economy began showing signs of gradual improvement in 2010 debt and equity markets experienced renewed disruption beginning early in the third quarter of 2011 including the downgrading of government issued debt in the united states and other countries the overall rate of global recovery experienced during the course of 2010 and 2011 remains uneven and recovery is still uncertain there can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be sustainable or that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows results of operations financial position or our ability to access capital our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location in addition our global facilities face risks that may relate to natural disasters labor relations or regulatory compliance while certain of these risks can be hedged in a limited way using financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful in addition our ability to engage in such mitigation has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

 many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable or successfully divest businesses 

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our acquisition of caliper in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 our acquisitions of dexela labtronics geospiza and cambridgesoft in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 and our acquisitions of artuslabs idb and chemagen in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons such as 

 14 

 some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences loss of key personnel unforeseen regulatory requirements previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results additionally if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies which may adversely impact our profitability 

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs as a result small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

 a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the united states postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

the manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries if we fail to comply with those regulations we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions some of the products produced by our human health segment are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales resales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar foreign and domestic agencies we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2011  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 17 

 if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and scientists and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

if we experience a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business in addition security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage 

we have a substantial amount of outstanding debt which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business 

we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations as of february 23 2012  we had approximately 10 billion  of debt on a consolidated basis 

our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 in addition we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs if we add new debt the risks described above could increase 

restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility our 6 senior unsecured notes due 2015 the “2015 notes” and our 2021 notes include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company these include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

 18 

 we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition in addition if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments 

any future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility our 2015 notes our 2021 notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances 

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

as of january 1 2012  our total assets included 28 billion  of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights core technology and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets 

adverse changes in our business adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units or the failure to grow our human health and environmental health segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our share price will fluctuate 

over the last several quarters stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 

 dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

on january 27 2012 we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 that will be payable in may 2012 in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

legal proceedings 

tableend   

enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc collectively “enzo” filed a complaint dated october 23 2002 in the united states district court for the southern district of new york civil action no 028448 against amersham plc amersham biosciences perkinelmer inc perkinelmer life sciences inc sigmaaldrich corporation sigma chemical company inc molecular probes inc and orchid biosciences inc the “new york case” the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo infringed enzo’s patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against enzo by among other things engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo’s patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief in 2003 the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants we subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo’s patents are invalid in july 2006 the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and we believe excludes certain of our products from the coverage of enzo’s patents summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in january 2007 and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in july 2007 in january 2009 the case was assigned to a new district court judge and in march 2009 the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decides enzo’s appeal of the judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut in enzo biochem vs applera corp and tropix inc the “connecticut case” which involves a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of enzo’s case against us on march 26 2010 the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmedinpart and reversedinpart the judgment in the connecticut case the new york case against us and other defendants remains stayed except that the district court has permitted us and the other defendants to jointly file a motion for summary judgment on certain patent and other issues common to all of the defendants 

  

we believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above and we are contesting the action vigorously while this matter is subject to uncertainty in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at january 1 2012  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

overview of fiscal year 2011   

during fiscal year 2011  we continued to see good performance from acquisitions investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives our overall revenue in fiscal year 2011   increase d 2169 million  or 13  as compared to fiscal year 2010  reflecting an increase  of 909 million  or 11  in our human health segment revenue and an increase  of 1261 million  or 14  in our environmental health segment revenue the increase  in our human health segment revenue during fiscal year 2011  was due primarily to growth generated from both our diagnostics and our medical imaging businesses partially offset by weakening demand in the research market the increase  in our environmental health segment revenue during fiscal year 2011  was due primarily to growth generated from our environmental food and consumer safety and testing products as well as in the industrial markets primarily related to chemical processing and energy applications supported by our molecular spectroscopy and chromatography platforms we also experienced continued growth in our onesource ®  multivendor service offering as our comprehensive service offering continues to grow with our key customers 

in our human health segment during fiscal year 2011  as compared to fiscal year 2010  we experienced growth in the diagnostics market from increased demand for our neonatal and infectious disease screening offerings particularly in emerging markets such as china and brazil in our medical imaging business we had continued growth from industrial and veterinary applications as well as demand for our newly acquired complementary metaloxidesemiconductor “cmos” imaging technology for orthopedic surgical and industrial applications we also completed our strategic acquisition of dexela limited dexela which is intended to add complementary imaging technology that should expand our medical imaging business and diversify our customer base the increases attributable to these factors were partially offset by the impact of tight inventory management in state and national labs for neonatal screening in the diagnostics market we experienced growth in the research market due to continued demand for our preclinical offerings including our operetta ®  cellular imaging instrument utilized for in vitro research our fluorescent reagents utilized for in vivo imaging our janus ®  automation tools and our envision ®  and enspire ™  multimode plate readers the growth in the research market was offset in part by reduced sales to pharmaceutical companies resulting from continued customer consolidations in the pharmaceutical market despite this decline we are encouraged by growth in china and india as demand from internal pharmaceutical research is migrating to lower cost regions we also completed our strategic acquisition of caliper life sciences inc caliper which is intended to enhance our molecular imaging and detection technologies and to complement our offerings in life science diagnostics environmental and food markets as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers we anticipate that even with continued pressure on lab budgets and credit availability the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease which can result in savings of longterm health care costs as well as creating better outcomes for patients are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets 

in our environmental health segment sales of environmental food and consumer safety and testing products grew in fiscal year 2011  as increased regulations in environmental and food safety markets continue to drive strong demand for our analytical instrumentation and followon consumables we saw continued strength in our inorganic analysis solutions such as our recently launched nexion ®  mass spectrometer as trace metals identification remains a critical component of contaminant detection for environmental as well as food and consumer safety applications we also had continued growth in our molecular spectroscopy offering utilized primarily for materials analysis chemical processing and semiconductor applications in the industrial markets we believe these trends will continue as emerging contaminant testing protocols and corresponding regulations are developed resulting in continued demand for highly efficient analytically sensitive and information rich testing 

solutions our laboratory services business continued to grow during fiscal year 2011  by adding new customers to our onesource multivendor service offering as well as continued growth of our comprehensive service offering with our key customers our laboratory services business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time while reducing maintenance costs all of which continue to be critical for our customers we also completed our strategic acquisition of cambridgesoft corporation cambridgesoft a provider of scientific databases and professional services this acquisition is intended to expand our software offerings to provide customers with solutions that help them create analyze and communicate scientific data while improving the speed quality efficiency and predictability of their research and development investments 

our consolidated gross margins decrease d 39  basis points in fiscal year 2011  as compared to fiscal year 2010  due to the fiscal year 2011  marktomarket charge for our postretirement benefit plans changes in product mix with growth in sales of lower gross margin product offerings and increased freight costs partially offset by increased sales volume and cost containment and productivity initiatives our consolidated operating margin decrease d 450  basis points in fiscal year 2011  as compared to fiscal year 2010  primarily as a result of the fiscal year 2011  marktomarket charge for our postretirement benefit plans increased costs related to acquisitions increased sales and marketing expenses particularly in emerging territories increased freight costs and growth investments in research and development partially offset by cost containment and productivity initiatives 

we believe we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the stable spending trends in our end markets and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services overall we believe that our strategic focus on human health and environmental health coupled with our breadth of end markets deep portfolio of technologies and applications leading market positions global scale and financial strength will provide us with a strong foundation for continued growth

the following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009  

  



  

the restructuring plans for the fourth quarter and second quarter of fiscal year 2011 and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 were intended principally to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets the restructuring plan for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 was intended principally to reduce resources in response to the continued economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets and to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets the activities associated with these plans have been reported as restructuring expenses and are included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect the impact of immediate cost savings from the restructuring plans on operating results and cash flows to approximately offset the increased spending in higher growth regions and the decline in revenue from certain products respectively we expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible as we will incur offsetting costs by shifting resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets

as part of our q2 2010 plan we reduced headcount by 115  employees all employee notifications and actions related to the closure of excess facility space for the q2 2010 plan were completed by july 4 2010 all employees have been notified of termination and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of 01 million  for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 we also anticipate that the remaining payments of 17 million  for the closure of excess facility space will be paid through fiscal year 2022 in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease 

  

the following table summarizes the components of our q2 2010 plan activity recognized by segment 

  



  

previous restructuring and integration plans 

the principal actions of the restructuring and integration plans from fiscal years 2001 through 2009 were workforce reductions related to the integration of our businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both our human health and environmental health segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy during fiscal year 2011 we paid 11 million  related to these plans recorded a reversal of 12 million  related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in europe within both our human health and environmental health segments and recorded a charge of 04 million  to reduce the estimated sublease rental payments reasonably expected to be obtained for an excess facility in europe within our environmental health segment in addition as part of the caliper acquisition we acquired its remaining restructuring accrual for the closure of an excess facility with a fair value of 38 million  at the acquisition date as of january 1 2012  we had approximately 83 million  of remaining liabilities associated with these restructuring and integration plans primarily for residual lease obligations related to closed facilities in both our human health and environmental health segments payments for these leases the terms of which vary in length will be made through fiscal year 2022 

  

contract termination charges 

we have terminated various contractual commitments in connection with various disposal activities for costs to terminate contracts before the end of the terms and costs that will continue to be incurred under various contracts for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us we recorded a pretax charge of 20 million  in fiscal year 2011  a pretax charge of 01 million  in fiscal year 2010  and a pretax charge of 09 million  in fiscal year 2009  for the termination of these contractual commitments we were required to make payments for these obligations of 04 million  during fiscal year 2011  17 million  during fiscal year 2010  and 11 million  during fiscal year 2009  the remaining balance of these accruals as of january 1 2012  was 21 million

2011  compared to 2010  impairment of assets was 30 million  in fiscal year 2011  and zero  in fiscal year 2010  the fiscal year 2011  impairment was a charge of 30 million  for the impairment of intangible assets within our human health segment for the full impairment of license agreements that we no longer intend to use relating to an acquisition in fiscal year 2006 

  

interest and other expense income net 

interest and other expense income net consisted of the following 

  



  

2011  compared to 2010  interest and other expense income net for fiscal year 2011  was an expense  of 268 million  as compared to income  of 84 million  for fiscal year 2010  a change of 352 million  the increase  in interest and other expense income net in fiscal year 2011  as compared to fiscal year 2010  was primarily due to the pretax gain of 256 million  recognized during fiscal year 2010  related to the required remeasurement to fair value of our previously held equity interest in the icpms joint venture and other related tangible assets interest expense increase d by 89 million  in fiscal year 2011  as compared to fiscal year 2010  primarily due to the increased debt and the higher interest rates on those debt balances with the issuance of the 2021 notes interest income increase d by 11 million  in fiscal year 2011  as compared to fiscal year 2010  primarily due to higher cash balances for fiscal year 2011  acquisition related financing costs related to certain acquisitions added expense of 31 million  and is included in interest expense other expenses for fiscal year 2011  as compared to fiscal year 2010   increase d by 17 million  and consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency transactions and translation of nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

2010  compared to 2009  interest and other expense income net for fiscal year 2010  was income  of 84 million  as compared to an expense  of 158 million  for fiscal year 2009  a decrease  of 242 million  the decrease  in interest and other expense income net in fiscal year 2010  as compared to fiscal year 2009  was primarily due to the pretax gain of 256 million  recognized during fiscal year 2010  related to the required remeasurement to fair value of our previously held equity interest in the icpms joint venture interest expense decrease d by 01 million  and interest income decrease d by 02 million  in fiscal year 2010  as compared to fiscal year 2009  primarily due to lower interest rates other expenses for fiscal year 2010  as compared to fiscal year 2009   increase d by 13 million  and consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency transactions and translation of nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 

  

provision for income taxes 

2011  compared to 2010  the fiscal year 2011  provision for income taxes on continuing operations was 632 million  as compared to a provision of 270 million  for fiscal year 2010  the effective tax rate on continuing operations was 982  for fiscal year 2011  as compared to 163  for fiscal year 2010  the higher effective tax rate in fiscal year 2011  as compared to fiscal year 2010  was primarily due to i an additional provision of 797 million  related to our planned 3500 million  repatriation of previously unremitted earnings and ii the mix of profits from lower tax rate jurisdictions 

  

2010  compared to 2009  the fiscal year 2010  provision for income taxes on continuing operations was 270 million  as compared to a provision of 267 million  for fiscal year 2009  the effective tax rate on continuing operations was 163  for fiscal year 2010  as compared to 267  for fiscal year 2009  the lower effective tax rate in fiscal year 2010  was primarily due to i the favorable impact related to the gain on the previously held equity interest in the icpms joint venture and ii the favorable settlement of several income tax audits worldwide during fiscal year 2010  see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these settlements 

  

discontinued operations

we recorded the following pretax gains and losses which have been reported as a gain loss on disposition of discontinued operations during the three fiscal years ended 

  



  

in november 2010 we sold our ids business which was included in our environmental health segment for 5103 million  including an adjustment for net working capital we expect the divestiture of our ids business to reduce the complexity of our product offerings and organizational structure and to provide capital to reinvest in other human health and environmental health end markets the buyer acquired our ids business through the purchase of all outstanding stock of certain of our subsidiaries located in germany canada china indonesia the philippines the united kingdom and the united states as well as the purchase of related assets and the assumption of liabilities held by us and certain of our subsidiaries located in singapore and germany we recognized a pretax gain of 3153 million  inclusive of the net working capital adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale of our ids business during fiscal year 2011  we finalized the net working capital adjustment associated with the sale of this business and other potential contingencies which resulted in the recognition of a pretax loss of 18 million  these gains and losses were recognized as gain loss on disposition of discontinued operations 

  

as part of our strategic business alignment into the human health and environmental health segments completed at the beginning of fiscal year 2009 and our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities in december 2008 our management approved a plan to divest our photoflash business within our environmental health segment in june 2010 we sold the photoflash business for 135 million  including an adjustment for net working capital plus potential additional contingent consideration we recognized a pretax gain of 44 million  inclusive of the net working capital adjustment in fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale this gain was recognized as a gain on disposition of discontinued operations

summary pretax operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods prior to disposition were as follows for the fiscal years ended 

  



  

we recognized a tax benefit  of 45 million  on discontinued operations in fiscal year 2011  a tax provision  of 966 million  on discontinued operations in fiscal year 2010  and a tax provision  of 33 million  in fiscal year 2009  on discontinued operations the recognition of 45 million  income tax benefit in fiscal year 2011  is primarily the net result of a change in estimate related to the federal income tax liability associated with the repatriation of the unremitted earnings of the ids and photoflash businesses as further described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k offset by the tax provision on the contingent consideration received in fiscal year 2011 related to the sale of our semiconductor business in fiscal year 2006 the recognition of 966 million  income tax expense in fiscal year 2010 includes 160 million  of income tax expense associated with unremitted earnings of directlyowned foreign subsidiaries that no longer qualified as indefinitely reinvested once the subsidiary was held for sale and 658 million  related to the federal income tax liability associated with the repatriation of the unremitted earnings of the ids and photoflash businesses as further described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k

we do not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2011  with the exception of the caliper acquisition to be material to our consolidated results of operations therefore we are not presenting pro forma financial information of operations the aggregate revenue for the acquisitions with the exception of caliper completed during fiscal year 2011  for the period from their respective acquisition dates to january 1 2012  was 324 million  we have also determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of those acquisitions from the date of acquisition is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date based on revenue thresholds or product development milestones achieved through given dates with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of definitelived intangible assets 

  

in connection with the purchase price and related allocations for acquisitions we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin thereon the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services we do not include any costs associated with selling effort research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs in most acquisitions profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value 

determination as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition the sum of the costs and operating income approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a thirdparty to assume the obligation as a result of purchase accounting we recognized the deferred revenue related to the acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2011 at fair value and recorded a liability of 183 million  which represents a 644 million  difference between the 827 million  of deferred revenue that was recorded on the preacquisition balance sheets of the acquired businesses 

  

as of january 1 2012  with the exception of the purchase price and related allocations for the caliper acquisition the purchase price and related allocations for acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2011 and 2010  were final the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the caliper acquisition was based upon a preliminary valuation and our estimates and assumptions underlying the preliminary valuation are subject to change within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition dates the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances and residual goodwill we expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date during the measurement period during the measurement period we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date adjustments to the initial allocation of the purchase price during the measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements the effect of measurement period adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price would be as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date the effects of measurement period adjustments may cause changes in depreciation amortization or other income or expense recognized in prior periods all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 

contingencies including tax matters 

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 67 million  as of january 1 2012  which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc collectively “enzo” filed a complaint dated october 23 2002 in the united states district court for the southern district of new york civil action no 028448 against amersham plc amersham biosciences perkinelmer inc perkinelmer life sciences inc sigmaaldrich corporation sigma chemical company inc molecular probes inc and orchid biosciences inc the “new york case” the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo infringed enzo’s patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against enzo by among other things engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo’s patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief in 2003 the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants we subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo’s patents are invalid in july 2006 the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and we believe excludes certain of our products from the coverage of enzo’s patents summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in january 2007 and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in july 2007 in january 2009 the case was assigned to a new district court judge and in march 2009 the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decides enzo’s appeal of the judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut in enzo biochem vs applera corp and tropix inc the “connecticut case” which involves a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of enzo’s case against us on march 26 2010 the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmedinpart and reversedinpart the judgment in the connecticut case the new york case against us and other 

defendants remains stayed except that the district court has permitted us and the other defendants to jointly file a motion for summary judgment on certain patent and other issues common to all of the defendants 

  

we believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above and we are contesting the action vigorously while this matter is subject to uncertainty in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

we remeasured several of our uncertain tax positions related to fiscal years 2004  through 2010  during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009  based on new information arising from events during the year that affected positions for those years we also settled several income tax audits worldwide the remeasurements and closure of audits included uncertain tax positions in italy hong kong the united kingdom australia the philippines and the federal and certain state governments within the united states the net effect of these remeasurements and closure of audits statute of limitations lapses provision to return adjustments interest expense accruals as well as other discrete items resulted in the recognition of 91 million  of income tax benefits  in continuing operations during fiscal year 2011  119 million  of income tax benefits  in continuing operations during fiscal year 2010  and 16 million  of income tax benefits  in continuing operations during fiscal year 2009  tax years ranging from 2001  through 2011  remain open to examination by various tax jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such as singapore canada finland germany the united kingdom and the united states the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at january 1 2012  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us 

  

reporting segment results of continuing operations

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january 1 2012  for continuing and discontinued operations 

  



 

  purchase commitments are minimal and have been excluded from this table 

  

capital expenditures 

during fiscal year 2012  we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2011  primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

at january 1 2012  we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1423 million  and a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with 3890 million  available for additional borrowing 

  

most of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed as a result of the caliper acquisition we concluded that certain foreign operations did not require the same level of capital as previously expected and therefore we plan to repatriate approximately 3500 million  of previously unremitted earnings and have provided for the estimated taxes on the repatriation of those earnings as a result of the planned repatriation we recorded an increase to our tax provision of 797 million  in continuing operations we expect to utilize tax attributes primarily those acquired in the caliper acquisition to minimize the cash taxes paid on the repatriation with the exception of 3500 million  we intend to repatriate over the next two 

to three years related to the acquisition of caliper we expect accumulated nonus cash balances will remain outside of the us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows use of us cash balances external borrowings or some combination of these sources 

  

on october 23 2008 we announced that our board authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million  shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the “repurchase program” on august 31 2010 we announced that our board had authorized us to repurchase an additional 50 million  shares of common stock under the repurchase program the repurchase program will expire on october 22 2012 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2011  we repurchased approximately 40 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 1078 million  including commissions under the repurchase program during fiscal year 2010  we repurchased approximately 30 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 715 million  including commissions under the repurchase program during fiscal year 2009  we repurchased approximately 10 million  shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 142 million  including commissions under the repurchase program as of january 1 2012  approximately 60 million  shares of common stock remained available for repurchase from the 150 million  shares authorized by our board under the repurchase program 

  

our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans during fiscal year 2011  we repurchased 84243  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 22 million  during fiscal year 2010  we repurchased 57551  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 13 million  during fiscal year 2009  we repurchased 28890  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of 04 million  

  

the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability creating increased volatility in security prices widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

  

we may be required to fund our us pension plans with contributions of up to 160 million  and our nonus pension plans with contributions of up to 111 million  by the end of fiscal year 2012  and we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans during fiscal year 2011  we made contributions of 115 million  to our defined benefit pension plans outside the united states during fiscal year 2010  we made a voluntary contribution of 300 million  for the 2009 plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states during fiscal year 2010  we also made contributions of 152 million  to our defined benefit pension plans outside the united states we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans 

  

effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates such recently issued and adopted pronouncements did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition warranty costs bad debts inventories accounting for business combinations and dispositions longlived assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may 

differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete for revenue that includes customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services 

  

in limited circumstances we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component such as cord blood processing and storage for these arrangements the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a sellingprice hierarchy a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis a delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting the selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe if such evidence is available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available and managements best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available tpe is the price of our or any competitors largely interchangeable products or services in standalone sales to similarlysituated customers besp is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis considering market conditions and entityspecific factors 

  

revenue from software licenses and services is 2  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2011  1  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2010  and 2  of our total revenue for fiscal year 2009  we sell our software licenses with maintenance services and in some cases also with consulting services for the undelivered elements we determine vsoe of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately we determine vsoe for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the amount that will be separately charged for the maintenance renewal period we determine vsoe for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements when a software license sale is not involved 

  

we recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance andor consulting services upon shipment using the residual method provided that the above criteria have been met if vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered or if the only undelivered element is maintenance then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period 

  

the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings 

  

inventory valuation we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase andor manufacture we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from 

operations than expected in that period 

  

business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest inprocess research and development “iprd” is recorded at fair value as an indefinitelived intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets 

value of longlived assets including goodwill and other intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized   in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite the assets will be tested for impairment these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization through fiscal year 2011  we assessed the annual impairment testing for our reporting units analytical sciences and laboratory services diagnostics life sciences technology and medical imaging we completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of january 3 2011  and january 4 2010 and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 

  

employee compensation and benefits during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011  we changed our method of recognizing defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs historically we recognized the actuarial gains and losses as a component of stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets these gains and losses were amortized into results of operations over the average future service period of the active employees to the extent such gains and losses were outside of a corridor additionally for our principal us defined benefit pension plan we used a calculated value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period under our new method of accounting we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur this change is intended to recognize the effects of current economic and interest rate trends on plan investments and assumptions as they occur actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement additionally we now use actual fair value of plan assets for the principal us defined benefit pension plan that had not previously utilized this method accordingly the financial data for all periods presented has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of these accounting changes we believe that the new policies are preferable as they eliminate the delay in the recognition of actuarial gains and losses and changes to the fair value of plan assets 

retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we incurred expenses of 750 million  in fiscal year 2011  38 million  in fiscal year 2010  and 213 million  in fiscal year 2009  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans which includes the charge for the marktomarket adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans which generally is recorded in the fourth quarter the expense related to marktomarket and curtailments on postretirement benefit plans was 679 million  in fiscal year 2011  02 million  in fiscal year 2010  and 64 million  in fiscal year 2009  we expect expenses of approximately 69 million  in fiscal year 2012  for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans excluding the charge for or benefit from the marktomarket adjustment it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a marktomarket adjustment in fiscal year 2012  and if one is required the amount of such an adjustment marktomarket adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control including changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease markto market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2012  conversely to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase markto market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2012  pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 

  

as of january 1 2012  we estimated the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was 775  and was 540  for all plans outside the united states in addition as of january 1 2012  we estimated the discount rate for our pension portfolios in the united states was 409  and was 491  for all plans outside the united states we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates at the measurement date if any of our assumptions were to change as of january 1 2012  our pension plan expenses would also change 

  



  

we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

  

restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and iii asset impairments as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous 

than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled “restructuring and contract termination charges net” 

  

gains or losses on dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the fiscal year ended january 1 2012  we recorded 01 million in pretax losses from disposition of fixed assets and 20 million in pretax gains from the disposition of discontinued operations any such changes decrease or increase current earnings 

  

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

  

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

  

additionally we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards state income tax credit carryforwards and certain foreign tax attributes valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable improvements or other changes in our operations domestically and internationally could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 

  

taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings that we continue to consider indefinitely reinvested the determination of which is based on our future operational and capital requirements we continue to maintain our indefinite reinvestment assertion with regards to the remaining unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore do not accrue us tax for the repatriation of the remaining unremitted foreign earnings as of january 1 2012  the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the us indefinitely and for which no us tax cost has been provided was approximately 3300 million  it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january 1 2012  

  

we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments by nature all financial instruments involve market and credit risks we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments approximately 62  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies therefore the fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing investing and operating the business 

  

in the ordinary course of business we may enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily denominated in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12  months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings we did not have any outstanding cash flow hedges during fiscal years 2011 and 2010  

  

principal hedged currencies include the british pound gbp canadian dollar cad euro eur japanese yen jpy and singapore dollar sgd we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us equivalent notional amounts totaling 2689 million  at january 1 2012  and 1073 million  at january 2 2011  and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the duration of these contracts was generally 30  days or less during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009  

  

in may 2008  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 150 million  upon the issuance of our 2015 notes and recognized 84 million  net of taxes of 54 million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense as of january 1 2012  the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the effective cash flow hedges was 41 million  net of taxes of 27 million  we amortized 20 million  into interest expense during each of the fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009  

  

market risk 

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 62  of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in natural hedges 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95  confidence interval and a holding period of 30  days as of january 1 2012  this computation estimated that there is a 5  chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 04 million  this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2011  the valueatrisk ranged between 04 million  and 05 million  with an average of approximately 04 million  

  

interest rate risk as described above our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

  

in may 2008  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 150 million  upon the issuance of our 2015 notes and recognized 84 million  net of taxes of 54 million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense as of january 1 2012  the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the effective cash flow hedges was 41 million  net of taxes of 27 million  we amortized 20 million  into interest expense during each of the fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009  

interest rate risk—sensitivity  as of january 1 2012  our debt portfolio consisted of 2980 million  of variable rate debt in addition our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 1423 million  at january 1 2012  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

i changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt consisting of 2980 million  of revolving debt facilities to fluctuate an increase of 10  or approximately 16  basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pretax charge to our earnings of 05 million  for fiscal year 2012  

  

ii changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate as described above an increase of 10  or approximately 16  basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 05 million  for fiscal year 2012  

  

iii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 

of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 1 2012  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework 

based on this assessment our management concluded that as of january 1 2012  our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

our registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting this report appears below 

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of perkinelmer inc 

waltham massachusetts 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of perkinelmer inc and subsidiaries the “company” as of january 1 2012  based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 1 2012  based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended january 1 2012  of the company and our report dated february 28 2012  expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the companys changes of its methods of recognizing defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and the companys change in the presentation of comprehensive income to reflect the requirements of financial accounting standards board accounting standards update 20115 comprehensive income  topic 220  as amended

recent developments 

  

as part of our strategy to grow our core businesses we have recently acquired the following businesses 

  

business combinations and asset purchases 

  

acquisition of chemagen biopolymertechnologie ag in february 2011 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of chemagen biopolymertechnologie ag “chemagen” chemagen manufactures and sells nucleic acid sample preparation systems and reagents utilizing mpva magnetic bead technology we expect this acquisition to enhance our genetic screening business by expanding our product offerings to diagnostics academic and industrial end markets we paid the shareholders of chemagen approximately 350 million in cash at the closing for the stock of chemagen plus potential additional consideration of up to 203 million the purchase price is also subject to potential adjustments for chemagen’s indebtedness working capital as of the closing date and indemnification obligations of chemagen’s equity holders we expect to report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our human health segment from the acquisition date 

  

acquisition of visen medical inc in july 2010 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of visen medical inc “visen” visen is an in vivo molecular imaging technology company we expect this acquisition to enhance our cellular imaging business by expanding our technologies and capabilities into preclinical research undertaken in academic institutes and pharmaceutical companies we paid the equity holders of visen 230 million in cash for the stock of visen of which 182 million was paid at closing and an additional amount of 48 million is held in an escrow account to secure potential adjustments for visen’s indebtedness working capital as of the closing date and indemnification obligations of visen’s equity holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 we finalized the purchase price and related allocation resulting in an increase in deferred tax assets included in longterm liabilities of 85 million and a decrease in goodwill of 85 million we have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our human health segment from the acquisition date 

  

acquisition of signature genomic laboratories llc in may 2010 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of sgl newco inc the parent company of signature genomic laboratories llc “signature genomic” signature genomic is a provider of diagnostic cytogenetic testing of chromosome abnormalities in individuals with unexplained physical and developmental disabilities we expect this acquisition to expand our existing genetic testing business and expand our position in early detection of disease specifically in the molecular diagnostics market we paid the equity holders of signature genomic 900 million in cash of which 775 million was paid at closing and an additional amount of 125 million is held in an escrow account to secure certain adjustments for signature genomic’s indebtedness working capital as of the closing date and indemnification obligations of signature genomic’s equity holders we have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our human health segment from the acquisition date 

  

acquisition of remaining interest in the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry joint venture in may 2010 we acquired the remaining fifty percent equity interest in our joint venture the “icpms joint venture” with the company previously known as mds inc for the development and manufacturing of our inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry “icpms” product line and other related tangible assets from dh technologies development pte ltd a subsidiary of danaher corporation “danaher” we expect this acquisition will help support the continued success of the premier icpms product line by allowing us to direct development with a dedicated and consistent approach the fair value of the acquisition was 677 million including cash consideration of 350 million noncash consideration of 26 million for certain nonexclusive rights to intangible assets we own and 304 million representing the fair value of our fifty percent equity interest in the icpms joint venture held prior to the acquisition we recognized a pretax gain of 256 million from the remeasurement to fair value of our previously held equity interest in the icpms joint venture this pretax gain is reported in interest and other income expense net for fiscal year 2010 we have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our environmental health segment from the acquisition date 

  

we recently took the following additional actions to further strengthen our core businesses 

  

restructuring 

  

during fiscal year 2010 we incurred a 126 million pretax restructuring charge in the human health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space we also recognized an 116 million pretax restructuring charge in the environmental health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space our management approved these plans principally to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets and to reduce resources in response to the continued economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain other end markets the restructuring costs for the closure of excess facility space were offset by the recognition of a 30 million gain that had been deferred from a previous salesleaseback transaction on this facility we also recorded a pretax restructuring reversal of 23 million relating to our previous restructuring plans due to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in europe within both the human health and environmental health segments the pretax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring 

  

expenses and is included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect the impact of immediate cost savings from these restructuring plans on operating results and cash flows to approximately offset the increased spending in higher growth regions and the decline in revenue from certain products respectively we expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible as we will incur offsetting costs 

  

discontinued operations 

  

divestiture of illumination and detection solutions business in november 2010 we sold our illumination and detection solutions “ids” business which was included in our environmental health segment for approximately 5000 million 4820 million net of payments for acquired cash balances subject to an adjustment for working capital as of the closing date we expect the divestiture of our ids business to reduce the complexity of our product offerings and organizational structure and to provide capital to reinvest in other human health and environmental health end markets the buyer acquired our ids business through the purchase of all outstanding stock of certain of our subsidiaries located in germany canada china indonesia the philippines the united kingdom and the united states as well as the purchase of related assets and the assumption of liabilities held by us and certain of our subsidiaries located in singapore and germany we recognized a pretax gain of 3153 million inclusive of the net working capital adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale of our ids business the gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations 

  

divestiture of photoflash business in june 2010 we sold our photoflash business for approximately 135 million including a net working capital adjustment plus potential additional consideration we recognized a pretax gain of 44 million inclusive of the net working capital adjustment in fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale the gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations 

  

as part of our ongoing business strategy we also took the following action 

  

share repurchase program 

  

on october 23 2008 we announced that our board of directors our “board” authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the “repurchase program” on august 31 2010 we announced that our board had authorized us to repurchase an additional 50 million shares of common stock under the repurchase program the repurchase program will expire on october 22 2012 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2008 we repurchased approximately 10 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 180 million including commissions under the repurchase program during fiscal year 2009 we repurchased approximately 10 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 142 million including commissions under the repurchase program during fiscal year 2010 we repurchased approximately 30 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 715 million including commissions under the repurchase program as of january 2 2011 approximately 100 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase from the 150 million shares authorized by our board under the repurchase program from january 3 2011 through february 24 2011 we repurchased approximately 30 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 806 million including commissions under the repurchase program 

  

business segments and products 

  

we report our business in two segments human health and environmental health we performed our annual impairment testing on january 4 2010 the annual impairment date for our reporting units and based on the first step of the impairment process the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment

marketing 

  

all of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces as of january 2 2011 we employed approximately 3000 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35 countries and marketing products and services in more than 150 countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials key components and supplies 

  

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with certain of our suppliers for certain critical raw materials key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components see the applicable risk factor in “item 1a risk factors” for an additional description of this issue 

  

intellectual property 

  

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear 

  

royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties we are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights see “item 3 legal proceedings” for a discussion of these matters 

  

backlog 

  

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

  

due to the wide range of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors this affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation operational efficiency product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market niches we expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

we believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenditures were approximately 954 million during fiscal year 2010 approximately 908 million during fiscal year 2009 and approximately 930 million during fiscal year 2008 

  

we directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental and safety industrial and laboratory services markets within our environmental health segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives we expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2011 and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental and safety industrial and laboratory services markets within our environmental health segment 

  

environmental matters 

  

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing uses emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 60 million as of january 2 2011 which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

in addition during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 we settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred at our facility in boston massachusetts in march 2005 we accrued 97 million representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building including environmental matters which was damaged in the fire we paid 25 million during fiscal year 2009 16 million during fiscal year 2008 and 39 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building we sold the building on april 27 2010 net proceeds from the sale were 110 million and we recorded a pretax gain of 34 million in operating income 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

  

as of january 2 2011 we employed approximately 6200 employees in our continuing operations compared to employing approximately 8200 employees in our continuing operations one year earlier the primary reason for the decrease in the number of our employees is due to the sale of our ids business which was partially offset by investments in higher growth geographic regions several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of january 2 2011 we employed an aggregate of approximately 800 union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 

  

financial information about reporting segments 

  

the expenses for our corporate headquarters such as legal tax audit human resources information technology and other management and compliance costs have been included as “corporate” below we have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when such costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses these amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments 

  

the table below sets forth sales and operating income loss by reporting segment for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 

  

   

discontinued operations have not been included in the preceding table 

  

additional information relating to our reporting segments for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 is as follows 

  

   

   

financial information about geographic areas 

  

both of our reporting segments conduct business in and derive substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during fiscal year 2010 we had 10344 million in sales from our international operations representing approximately 61 of our total sales during fiscal year 2010 we derived approximately 43 of our international sales from our human health segment and approximately 57 of our international sales from our environmental health segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future 

  

we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements additional geographic information is discussed in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations and are not materially different from those factors reported in our quarterly report on form 10q for the period ended october 3 2010 

  

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

  

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly sales and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding restrictions in capital expenditures general economic conditions cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

  

our growth is subject to global economic political and other risks 

  

we have operations in many parts of the world the health of the global economy has a significant impact on our business the global economy which experienced a significant downturn throughout 2008 and 2009 including the effects of the credit market crisis and the resulting impact on the finance and banking industries volatile currency exchange rates and energy costs inflation concerns decreased consumer confidence reduced corporate profits and capital expenditures and liquidity concerns began showing signs of gradual improvement in 2010 however while some economic indicators improved the overall rate of global recovery experienced during the course of 2010 has been uneven and the recovery is still uncertain there can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be sustainable or that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows results of operations financial position or our ability to access capital our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location in addition our global manufacturing facilities face risks to their production capacity that may relate to natural disasters labor relations or regulatory compliance while certain of these risks can be hedged in a limited way using financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful in addition our ability to engage in such mitigation has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

  

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

  

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential sales revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

  

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

  

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable or successfully divest businesses 

  

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our acquisitions of chemagen visen and signature genomic and our purchase of the remaining interest in the icpms joint venture however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences unforeseen regulatory requirements previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results additionally if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

  

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies which expenses may adversely impact our profitability 

  

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

  

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

  

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

  

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

  

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

  

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

  

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

  

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

  

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs as a result small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

  

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the united states postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

  

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

  

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components and other goods could usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

  

the manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

  

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

  

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries if we fail to comply with those regulations we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions some of the products produced by our human health segment are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling 

  

manufacturing promotion sales resales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar foreign and domestic agencies we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

  

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

  

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

  

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

  

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

  

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

  

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total sales in the fiscal year ended january 2 2011 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

  

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

  

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

if we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on several centralized information systems throughout our company to keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers and suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business 

  

restrictions in our credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

  

our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 6 senior unsecured notes contain and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company these debt instruments include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 

  

our failure to comply with any of these restrictions in our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 6 senior unsecured notes may result in an event of default under either or both of these debt instruments which could permit acceleration of the debt under either or both debt instruments and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date 

  

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

  

as of january 2 2011 our total assets included 19 billion of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights core technology and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible assets 

  

adverse changes in our business adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units or the failure to grow our human health and environmental health segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our share price will fluctuate 

  

over the last several quarters stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 

  

   

   

   

   

   

dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

  

on october 27 2010 we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 which was paid in february 2011 on january 24 2011 we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 that is payable in may 2011 in the future our board may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

overview of fiscal year 2010 

  

during fiscal year 2010 we continued to see positive signs of recovery from the global economic contraction across most of our end markets and geographies in addition to good performance from investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives our overall sales in fiscal year 2010 increased 1536 million or 10 as compared to fiscal year 2009 reflecting an increase of 647 million or 9 in our human health segment sales and an increase of 889 million or 11 in our environmental health segment sales the increase in our human health segment sales during fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to increased demand for our medical imaging products with the expansion of panel usage for diagnostic oncology and nonmedical applications and the easing of capital budget constraints in major hospitals in the diagnostics market as well as increased growth in the academic sector for both instruments and reagents in the research market these increases were partially offset by the impact of lower birth rates in the united states and tight inventory management in state and national labs for neonatal screening in the diagnostics market as well as continued constrained capital spending within our pharmaceutical customers in the research market particularly in the area of high throughput screening customer consolidations in the pharmaceutical market also had an unfavorable impact on our research business the increase in our environmental health segment sales during fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to the increase in our onesource ® multivendor service offering which we expanded in markets beyond our traditional customer base and services as well as growth in our environmental food and consumer safety and testing products we also experienced continued growth in traditional chemical markets with the reduction of constraints on capital purchases to rebuild capacity as a result of the cyclical recovery and increased demand after the extended period of delayed capital investment 

  

in our human health segment we experienced strong growth in sales in the diagnostics market related to increased demand for our medical imaging products and continued growth in our prenatal offerings within the genetic screening business during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 the increased demand for our medical imaging products resulted from improved market conditions that lessened the constraints on medical providers’ capital budgets allowing us to increase our customer base as well as expanding into nonmedical applications the performance within our genetic screening business was driven by continued expansion of prenatal screening platforms with broadbased growth experienced across all major geographies particularly in china with continued expansion of our newborn screening business through our acquisition of symbio lifescience co ltd “symbio” in fiscal year 2009 in the research market demand for our reagents and 

  

instrumentation was encouraging in the academic sector we saw strong demand for our highend opera ® cellular imaging systems enspire™ plate readers and proprietary alpha detection reagents which are all specifically developed to address the growing needs of the academic sector we are refocusing resources to meet our pharmaceutical customer’s evolving needs as these customers shift their spending on downstream technologies in preclinical research we are well positioned with our invivo imaging offering available through our newly acquired visen business as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers we anticipate that even with continued pressure on lab budgets and credit availability the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease which can result in savings of longterm health care costs as well as creating better outcomes for patients are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets 

  

in our environmental health segment our laboratory services business enables our customers to drive efficiencies increase production time and reduce maintenance costs all of which continue to be critical for our customers during fiscal year 2010 we continued to grow by adding new customers to our onesource ® multivendor service offering which we expanded in markets beyond our traditional customer base and services sales of environmental food and consumer safety and testing products grew in fiscal year 2010 due to the continued global need for robust contaminant identification solutions particularly for trace metals analysis in water this trend drove the demand for our inorganic analysis solutions such as our optima 7000 and our recently launched nexion ® mass spectrometer we also continued to experience strong demand for quality and safety assurance testing equipment in food and pharmaceuticals throughout the global supply chain in addition we continued to see signs of recovery in our traditional chemical markets with the reduction of constraints on capital purchases to rebuild capacity as a result of the cyclical recovery and increased demand after an extended period of delayed capital investments we believe that the need for increased inspection testing and tracking of contaminants will continue to drive increased demand for our products 

  

our consolidated gross margins decreased approximately 60 basis points in fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 due to changes in product mix with growth in sales of lower gross margin product offerings partially offset by productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives our consolidated operating margin improved approximately 120 basis points in fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 primarily the result of increased sales volume and cost containment initiatives partially offset by restructuring activities increased pension expenses initial costs on key growth initiatives and the early stage dilution from our recent acquisitions specifically signature genomic and visen 

  

we believe we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the improved spending trends in our end markets and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services overall we believe that our strategic focus on human health and environmental health coupled with our breadth of end markets deep portfolio of technologies and applications leading market positions global scale and financial strength will provide us with a strong foundation for continued growth

restructuring and lease charges net 

  

we have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures alignment with our growth strategy and the integration of our business units restructuring and lease charges net for fiscal year 2010 were a 190 million charge as compared to an 180 million charge for fiscal year 2009 and a 67 million charge for fiscal year 2008 

  

the following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 

  

   

the restructuring plan for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 was intended principally to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets the restructuring plans for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 were intended principally to reduce resources in response to the continued economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets and to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets the restructuring plan for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 was intended principally to reduce resources in response to the economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets the activities associated with these plans have been reported as restructuring expenses and are included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect the impact of immediate cost savings from these restructuring plans on operating results and cash flows to approximately offset the increased spending in higher growth regions and the decline in revenue from certain products respectively we expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible as we will incur offsetting costs 

  

q4 2010 plan 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 our management approved a plan to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets our “q4 2010 plan” as a result of our q4 2010 plan we recognized a 56 million pretax restructuring charge in our human health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space we also recognized a 76 million pretax restructuring charge in our environmental health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space the restructuring costs for the closure of excess facility space was offset by the recognition of a 28 million gain that had been deferred from a previous salesleaseback transaction on this facility 

  

as part of our q4 2010 plan we reduced headcount by 113 employees all notifications and actions related to our q4 2010 plan were completed by january 2 2011 all employee relationships have been severed and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of 79 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 we also anticipate that the remaining payments of 41 million for the closure of excess facility space will be paid through fiscal year 2022 in accordance with the terms of the applicable leases

previous restructuring and integration plans 

  

the principal actions of the restructuring and integration plans from fiscal years 2001 through 2008 were workforce reductions related to the integration of our businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both our human health and environmental health segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy during fiscal year 2010 we paid 15 million related to these plans recorded a reversal of 09 million related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in europe within both the human health and environmental health segments and recorded a charge of 04 million to reduce the estimated sublease rental 

  

payments reasonably expected to be obtained for an excess facility in europe within our environmental health segment as of january 2 2011 we had approximately 37 million of remaining liabilities associated with these restructuring and integration plans primarily for residual lease obligations related to closed facilities in both our human health and environmental health segments payments for these leases the terms of which vary in length will be made through fiscal year 2022 

  

lease charges 

  

to facilitate the sale of a business in fiscal year 2001 we were required to guarantee the lease obligations that the buyer assumed related to the lease for the building in which the business operated the lease obligations continue through march 2011 while we assigned our interest in the lease to the buyer at the time of the sale of the business the buyer subsequently defaulted under the lease and the lessor sought reimbursement from us we recorded a charge of 27 million in fiscal year 2007 related to payments for this lease obligation the buyer filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 and was delinquent in making both its lease payments and payments for certain building expenses the buyer ceased operations in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 and vacated the property we recorded an additional charge of 09 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 related to waste removal and restoration costs and reduced the estimated sublease rental payments reasonably expected to be obtained for the property we also recorded an additional charge of 01 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 to further reduce the estimated sublease rental payments reasonably expected to be obtained for the property we were required to make payments for these obligations of 17 million during fiscal year 2010 11 million during fiscal year 2009 and 04 million during fiscal year 2008 the remaining balance of this accrual as of january 2 2011 was 05 million 

  

interest and other income expense net 

  

interest and other income expense net consisted of the following 

  

   

2010 compared to 2009 interest and other income expense net for fiscal year 2010 was income of 84 million as compared to an expense of 158 million for fiscal year 2009 an increase of 242 million the increase in interest and other income expense net in fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to the pretax gain of 256 million related to the required remeasurement to fair value of our previously held equity interest in the icpms joint venture interest expense decreased by 01 million and interest income decreased by 02 million in fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 primarily due to lower interest rates other expenses for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 increased by 13 million which consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency transactions and foreign currency translation a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

2009 compared to 2008 interest and other income expense net for fiscal year 2009 was an expense of 158 million as compared to an expense of 440 million for fiscal year 2008 a decrease of 283 million the decrease in interest and other income expense net in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to the discontinuance and settlement of forward interest rate contracts with a 175 million loss that 

  

was recognized into interest expense during fiscal year 2008 as well as lower interest rates on outstanding debt balances partially offset by the increase in the mix of our fixed rate versus variable rate debt interest income decreased 30 million as a result of lower interest rates on lower cash balances other expenses for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 decreased by 73 million and consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency transactions and foreign currency translation 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

2010 compared to 2009 the fiscal year 2010 provision for income taxes on continuing operations was 261 million as compared to a provision of 318 million for fiscal year 2009 the effective tax rate on continuing operations was 161 for fiscal year 2010 as compared to 300 for fiscal year 2009 the lower effective tax rate in fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to i the favorable impact related to the gain on the previously held equity interest in the icpms joint venture and ii the favorable settlement of several income tax audits worldwide during fiscal year 2010 see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these settlements 

  

2009 compared to 2008 the fiscal year 2009 provision for income taxes on continuing operations was 318 million as compared to a provision of 127 million for fiscal year 2008 the effective tax rate on continuing operations was 300 for fiscal year 2009 as compared to 123 for fiscal year 2008 the higher effective tax rate in fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the expected mix of profits from higher tax rate jurisdictions in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 and reflects the favorable settlement of several income tax audits worldwide in fiscal year 2008 see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these settlements 

  

discontinued operations 

  

as part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have discontinued certain businesses we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of january 2 2011 and january 3 2010

in november 2010 we sold our illumination and detection solutions “ids” business which was included in our environmental health segment for approximately 5000 million 4820 million net of payments for acquired cash balances subject to an adjustment for working capital as of the closing date we expect the divestiture of our ids business to reduce the complexity of our product offerings and organizational structure 

  

and to provide capital to reinvest in other human health and environmental health end markets the buyer acquired our ids business through the purchase of all outstanding stock of certain of our subsidiaries located in germany canada china indonesia the philippines the united kingdom and the united states as well as the purchase of related assets and the assumption of liabilities held by us and certain of our subsidiaries located in singapore and germany we recognized a pretax gain of 3153 million inclusive of the net working capital adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale of our ids business the gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations 

  

as part of our strategic business alignment into our human health and environmental health segments completed at the beginning of fiscal year 2009 and our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities in december 2008 our management approved separate plans to divest our photonics and photoflash businesses the distressed economic conditions during fiscal year 2009 adversely impacted our plan to market and sell the photonics and photoflash businesses we implemented a number of actions during fiscal year 2009 to respond to these changing circumstances and continued to actively market these businesses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 we determined that we could not effectively market and sell the photonics business given the changed circumstances and after careful consideration we decided to cease our plan to actively market and sell the photonics business on a standalone basis the photonics business was included with the set of businesses which were sold as our ids business as described above in june 2010 we sold the photoflash business for approximately 135 million including a net working capital adjustment plus potential additional contingent consideration we recognized a pretax gain of 44 million inclusive of the net working capital adjustment in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale the gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations 

  

in addition during december 2008 our management approved the shut down of certain instrument businesses within our human health segment including the cellular screening fluorescence and luminescence workstations analytical proteomics instruments and proteomics and genomics instruments which resulted in a pretax gain of 01 million a pretax gain of 04 million and a pretax loss of 48 million related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

in november 2007 we acquired viacell which specializes in the collection testing processing and preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells following the viacell acquisition our board of directors our “board” approved a plan to sell the viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses that were acquired with viacell we determined that both businesses did not strategically fit with the other products offered by our human health segment we also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses we could not effectively compete with larger companies that focus on the market for such products after careful consideration we decided in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 to shut down the viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses we recorded a pretax loss of 80 million for severance and facility closure costs during fiscal year 2008 and recorded additional pretax losses of 01 million and 13 million related to facility closure costs during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 we settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations and recognized a pretax loss of 18 million in fiscal year 2010 a pretax loss of 21 million in fiscal year 2009 and a pretax loss of 04 million in fiscal year 2008 during fiscal year 2009 we reached a settlement with the landlord of a closed facility and recognized a pretax loss of 14 million 

  

summary pretax operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods prior to disposition were as follows 

  

   

we recognized a tax provision of 940 million on discontinued operations in fiscal year 2010 a tax provision of 46 million on discontinued operations in fiscal year 2009 and a tax benefit of 21 million in fiscal year 2008 on discontinued operations the recognition of 940 million income tax expense in fiscal year 2010 includes 160 million of income tax expense associated with unremitted earnings of directlyowned foreign subsidiaries that no longer qualify as permanently reinvested once the subsidiary is held for sale and 658 million of income tax expense for additional unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries associated with the sale of our ids and photoflash businesses that do not require the same level of capital as previously required and therefore we plan to repatriate 2500 million of cash and have provided for the taxes on the related previously unremitted earnings the benefit from income taxes of 21 million recorded in discontinued operations in fiscal year 2008 includes 85 million of income tax benefits related to the favorable settlement of several income tax audits worldwide during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these settlements

as of january 2 2011 the purchase price and related allocation for the acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were final for acquisitions completed subsequent to fiscal year 2008 during the measurement period we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date adjustments to the initial allocation of the purchase price during the measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements the effect of measurement period adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price would be as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date the effects of measurement period adjustments may cause changes in depreciation amortization or other income or expense recognized in prior periods all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 

  

contingencies including tax matters 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 60 million as of january 2 2011 which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc collectively “enzo” filed a complaint dated october 23 2002 in the united states district court for the southern district of new york civil action no 028448 against amersham plc amersham biosciences perkinelmer inc perkinelmer life sciences inc sigmaaldrich corporation sigma chemical company inc molecular probes inc and orchid biosciences inc the “new york case” the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo infringed enzo’s patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against enzo by among other things engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo’s patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief in 2003 the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants we subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo’s patents are invalid in july 2006 the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and we believe excludes certain of our products from the coverage of enzo’s patents summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in january 2007 and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in july 2007 in january 2009 the case was assigned to a new district court judge and in march 2009 the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decides enzo’s appeal of the judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut in enzo biochem vs applera corp and tropix inc the “connecticut case” which involves a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of enzo’s case against us on march 26 2010 the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit “cafc” affirmedinpart and reversedinpart the judgment in the connecticut case pending further disposition of the connecticut case the new york case against us and other defendants remains stayed 

  

we believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above and we are contesting the action vigorously while this matter is subject to uncertainty in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

we remeasured several of our uncertain tax positions related to fiscal years 2006 through 2009 during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 based on new information arising from events during the year that affected positions for those years we also effectively settled several income tax audits worldwide the remeasurements and closure of audits included uncertain tax positions in hong kong the united kingdom australia the philippines and the federal and certain state governments within the united states the net effect of these remeasurements and closure of audits statute of limitations lapses provision to return adjustments interest expense accruals as 

  

well as other discrete items resulted in the recognition of 119 million of income tax benefits in continuing operations during fiscal year 2010 and 17 million of income tax benefits in continuing operations during fiscal year 2009 during fiscal year 2008 we effectively settled several income tax audits worldwide including in canada the netherlands the united kingdom and the united states covering various years ranging from 1998 through 2005 the closing of these audits resulted in the recognition of 156 million of income tax benefits in continuing operations and 85 million of income tax benefits in discontinued operations tax years ranging from 2000 through 2010 remain open to examination by various tax jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such as singapore canada germany the united kingdom and the united states the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at january 2 2011 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us 

  

reporting segment results of continuing operations 

  

human health 

  

2010 compared to 2009 sales for fiscal year 2010 were 7963 million as compared to 7316 million for fiscal year 2009 an increase of 647 million or 9 which includes an approximate 3 increase in sales attributable to acquisitions and no net impact from changes in foreign exchange rates the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by product type for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions the increase in sales in our human health segment was primarily a result of an increase in diagnostics market sales of 545 million and an increase in research market sales of 102 million this increase in our human health segment sales during fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to the increased demand for our medical imaging products in the diagnostics market as well as increased growth in the academic sector for both instruments and reagents in the research market the demand for our medical imaging products resulted from improved market conditions that eased the constraints on medical providers’ capital budgets allowing us to increase our customer base including expanding into nonmedical applications these increases were partially offset by tight inventory management in state and national labs for neonatal screening in the diagnostics market as well as customer consolidations in the pharmaceutical market and by the continued constrained capital spending within our pharmaceutical customers in the research market 

  

operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2010 was 965 million as compared to 806 million for fiscal year 2009 an increase of 159 million or 20 amortization of intangible assets was 467 million and 413 million for fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2009 respectively restructuring and lease charges were 104 million for fiscal year 2010 as a result of our q2 2010 and q4 2010 plans as compared to 92 million for fiscal year 2009 as a result of our q1 2009 and q3 2009 plans the gain on the sale of a facility in boston massachusetts that was damaged in a fire in march 2005 was 34 million for fiscal year 2010 purchase accounting adjustments for contingent consideration and other acquisition costs related to certain acquisitions added an expense of 13 million for each of the fiscal years 2010 and 2009 the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2009 was 11 million increased sales volume and cost containment initiatives increased operating income for fiscal year 2010

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

receivables securitization facility during fiscal year 2001 we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a receivables purchase agreement with a thirdparty financial institution under this arrangement we sold on a revolving basis certain of our accounts receivable balances to the consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a thirdparty financial institution as collections reduced the balance of sold accounts receivable new receivables were sold our consolidated subsidiary retained the risk of credit loss on the receivables accordingly the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts had been provided for on our balance sheets the amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the thirdparty financial institution was not to exceed 650 million reduced to 500 million in march 2009 under the terms of this agreement our consolidated subsidiary 

  

retained collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances the agreement required the thirdparty financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the receivable was sold to its maturity date the servicing fees received constituted adequate compensation for services performed no servicing asset or liability was therefore recorded 

  

in march 2009 our consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts receivable securitization facility to december 30 2009 on june 30 2009 our consolidated subsidiary exercised the right to terminate the receivables purchase agreement with a thirdparty financial institution releasing both parties of their rights liabilities and obligations under this agreement 

  

dividends

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january 2 2011 for continuing and discontinued operations 

  

  

     

capital expenditures 

  

during fiscal year 2011 we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2010 primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

  

at january 2 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 4201 million and an amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility with 3620 million available for additional borrowing most of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies almost all of the amounts held outside of the us are available for repatriation subject to relevant tax consequences we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed with the exception of 2500 million related to the sale of our ids business we expect accumulated nonus cash balances will remain outside of the us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows use of us cash balances external borrowings or some combination of these sources 

  

on october 23 2008 we announced that our board authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the “repurchase program” on august 31 2010 we announced that our board had authorized us to repurchase an additional 50 million shares of common stock under the repurchase program the repurchase program will expire on october 22 2012 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2008 we repurchased approximately 10 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 180 million including commissions under the repurchase program during fiscal year 2009 we repurchased approximately 10 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 142 million including commissions under the repurchase program during fiscal year 2010 we repurchased approximately 30 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 715 million including commissions under the repurchase program as of january 2 2011 approximately 100 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase from the 150 million shares authorized by our board under the repurchase program from january 3 2011 through february 24 2011 we repurchased approximately 30 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 806 million including commissions under the repurchase program 

  

our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans during fiscal year 2008 we repurchased 37521 shares of common stock during fiscal year 2009 we repurchased 28890 shares of common stock during fiscal year 2010 we repurchased 57551 shares of common stock for this purpose 

  

the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

in november 2010 we sold our ids business for approximately 5000 million 4820 million net of payments for acquired cash balances subject to an adjustment for working capital as of the closing date the divestiture of our ids business is expected to reduce the complexity of our product offerings and organizational structure and to provide capital to reinvest in other human health and environmental health end markets the buyer acquired our ids business through the purchase of all outstanding stock of certain of our subsidiaries located in germany canada china indonesia the philippines the united kingdom and the united states as well as the purchase of related assets and the assumption of liabilities held by us and certain of our subsidiaries located in singapore and germany we recognized a pretax gain of 3153 million inclusive of the net working capital adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale of our ids business the gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations 

  

as a result of the sale of the ids and photoflash businesses we concluded that the remaining operations within those foreign subsidiaries previously containing ids and photoflash operations did not require the same 

  

level of capital as previously required and therefore we plan to repatriate 2500 million of cash and have provided for the taxes on the related previously unremitted earnings taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings that we continue to consider permanently reinvested which is based on our future operational and capital requirementsthe impact of this tax provision in fiscal year 2010 was an increase to our tax provision of 658 million in discontinued operations we expect to utilize existing tax attributes to repatriate these earnings and expect the taxes to be paid to repatriate these earnings will be minimal 

  

in november 2009 the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 was enacted and allowed businesses with net operating losses for 2008 or 2009 to carry back those losses for up to five years we had anticipated carrying back losses of up to 800 million at the end of fiscal 2009 and classified certain deferred taxes anticipated to be monetized with the filing of the 2009 tax return as a tax receivable subsequently we decided not to implement all of the tax deferral strategies previously anticipated and carried back losses of 436 million from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2005 as a result the tax attributes that related to tax deferral strategies not implemented have reduced our deferred tax liability balances with a corresponding reduction in income tax receivable we received a federal income tax refund of 89 million in january 2011 and generated general business tax credit carryforwards of 64 million 

  

in connection with the settlement of an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred at our facility in boston massachusetts in march 2005 we accrued 97 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building including environmental matters which was damaged in the fire we paid 25 million during fiscal year 2009 16 million during fiscal year 2008 and 39 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building we sold the building on april 27 2010 net proceeds from the sale were 110 million and we recorded a pretax gain of 34 million in operating income 

  

distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability creating increased volatility in security prices widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

  

our pension plans have not experienced any material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets as a result of significant losses experienced in global equity markets during fiscal year 2008 although our pension funds had modest gains for fiscal year 2009 and fiscal year 2010 we experienced increased pension costs in fiscal year 2010 we could potentially experience increased costs in additional future periods for all pension plans we may be required to fund our pension plans with contributions of up to 110 million by the end of fiscal year 2011 and we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans during fiscal year 2010 we made a voluntary contribution of 300 million for the 2009 plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states to realize the benefit received from favorable tax provisions included in the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 as described above during fiscal year 2010 we also made contributions of 152 million for the 2009 plan year to our defined benefit pension plans outside the united states 

  

effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 

  

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates unless otherwise discussed below we believe that the impact of recently issued and adopted pronouncements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 

  

in october 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance on multipledeliverable revenue arrangements this guidance establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenuegenerating activities this guidance provides amendments to the criteria for separating and measuring deliverables and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting the amendments in this guidance also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor’s multipledeliverable revenue arrangements including information about the nature and terms of significant deliverables and a vendor’s performance within those arrangements once adopted the amendments will also require a company to provide information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about the way the application of the relative sellingprice method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on multipledeliverable revenue arrangements in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 we are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements 

  

in october 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance on certain revenue arrangements that include software elements this guidance changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are “essential to the functionality” of the product and excludes these products from current software revenue guidance the new guidance will include factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered “essential to the functionality” of the product once adopted the amendments will subject softwareenabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on certain revenue arrangements that include software elements in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 we are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements 

  

in march 2010 the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition once adopted this guidance will allow the milestone method as an acceptable revenue recognition methodology when an arrangement includes substantive milestones this guidance provides a definition of a substantive milestone that should be applied regardless of whether the arrangement includes single or multiple deliverables or units of accounting the scope of the applicability of this definition is limited to transactions involving milestones relating to research and development deliverables this guidance also includes enhanced disclosure requirements about each arrangement individual milestones and related contingent consideration information about substantive milestones and factors considered in the determination of whether this methodology is appropriate early application and retrospective application are permitted we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 we expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them when arrangements include multiple elements we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings 

  

inventory valuation we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase andor manufacture we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

  

business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest inprocess research and development “iprd” is recorded at fair value as an indefinitelived intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect income tax expense all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets 

  

value of longlived assets including intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized  in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite the assets will be tested for impairment these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization through fiscal year 2010 we assessed the annual impairment testing using the analytical sciences and laboratory services genetic screening biodiscovery and medical imaging reporting units we completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of january 4 2010 and january 1 2009 and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 

  

employee compensation and benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we incurred expenses of 146 million in fiscal year 2010 130 million in fiscal year 2009 and 83 million in fiscal year 2008 for our retirement and postretirement plans we expect expenses of approximately 138 million in fiscal year 2011 for our retirement and postretirement plans pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 

  

as of january 2 2011 we estimated the expected longterm rate of return on assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was 81 and was 67 for all plans outside the united states we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates at the measurement date if any of our assumptions were to change our pension plan expenses would also change a onequarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by 05 million for fiscal year 2011 in the united states and by 06 million for fiscal year 2011 for all plans outside the united states a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pretax pension expense by 23 million for fiscal year 2011 in the united 

  

states and by 09 million for fiscal year 2011 for all plans outside the united states we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

  

restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and iii asset impairments as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statement of operations line entitled “restructuring and lease charges reversals net” 

  

gains or losses on dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the fiscal year ended january 2 2011 we recorded 34 million in pretax gains from disposition of fixed assets we recorded 3179 million in pretax gains from the disposition of discontinued operations any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the “gains on disposition” or “discontinued operations” line items appearing in our consolidated statement of operations 

  

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

  

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

  

additionally we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits other income tax credits and certain pension accruals valuation 

  

allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable improvements or other changes in our operations domestically and internationally could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial instruments 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january 2 2011 

  

we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments by nature all financial instruments involve market and credit risks we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments approximately 61 of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies therefore the fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing investing and operating the business 

  

in the ordinary course of business we may enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily denominated in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings we did not have any outstanding cash flow hedges during fiscal year 2010 

  

principal hedged currencies include the british pound gbp canadian dollar cad euro eur japanese yen jpy and singapore dollar sgd we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us equivalent notional amounts totaling 1073 million at january 2 2011 and 1685 million at january 3 2010 and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the duration of these contracts was generally 30 days or less during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 

  

we entered into forward interest rate contracts in october 2007 with notional amounts totaling 3000 million and a weighted average interest rate of 425 that were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance in may 2008 we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million upon the issuance of our 6 senior unsecured notes and recognized 84 million net of taxes of 54 million of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive loss income during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance with a notional amount totaling 1500 million was no longer probable as a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million and recognized a loss of 175 million in interest and other income expense net 

  

as of january 2 2011 the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the effective cash flow hedges was 53 million net of taxes of 34 million the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense we amortized 20 million into interest expense during each of the fiscal years 2010 and 2009 and 12 million during fiscal year 2008 

  

market risk 

  

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 61 of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in natural hedges 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days as of january 2 2011 this computation estimated that there is a 5 chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 03 million this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2010 the valueatrisk ranged between 02 million and 04 million with an average of approximately 03 million 

  

interest rate risk as described above our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

  

we entered into forward interest rate contracts in october 2007 with notional amounts totaling 3000 million and a weighted average interest rate of 425 that were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance in may 2008 we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million upon the issuance of our 6 senior unsecured notes and recognized 84 million net of taxes of 54 million of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive loss income during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance with a notional amount totaling 1500 million was no longer probable as a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million and recognized a loss of 175 million in interest and other income expense net 

  

as of january 2 2011 the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the effective cash flow hedges was 53 million net of taxes of 34 million the derivative losses are being 

  

amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense we amortized 20 million into interest expense during each of the fiscal years 2010 and 2009 and 12 million during fiscal year 2008 

  

interest rate risk—sensitivity  as of january 2 2011 our debt portfolio consisted of 2740 million of variable rate debt in addition our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 4201 million at january 2 2011 our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

i changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt consisting of 2740 million of revolving debt facilities to fluctuate an increase of 10 or approximately 7 basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pretax charge to our earnings of 02 million for fiscal year 2011 

  

ii changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate as described above an increase of 10 or approximately 7 basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 02 million for fiscal year 2011 

  

iii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

   

   

   

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2011 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework 

  

based on this assessment our management concluded that as of january 2 2011 our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

our registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting this report appears below

waltham massachusetts 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of perkinelmer inc and subsidiaries the “company” as of january 2 2011 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2011 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended january 2 2011 of the company and our report dated march 1 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

recent developments 

  

as part of our strategy to grow our core businesses we have recently taken the following actions 

  

business combinations and asset purchases 

  

acquisition of remaining interest in the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry joint venture in january 2010 we entered into a binding letter agreement with dh technologies development pte ltd a subsidiary of danaher corporation to purchase the remaining interest in our joint venture with mds inc for the development and manufacturing of our inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry “icpms” product line we expect this acquisition will help ensure the continued success of the premier icpms product line through a dedicated and consistent approach we anticipate that the transfer of the interest will be completed by the end of 

  

the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 we expect to pay approximately 350 million in cash for this acquisition and to record a gain on our previously held interest we expect to report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our environmental health segment from the acquisition date 

  

purchase of intangible assets from ge healthcare in september 2009 we purchased the core technology and patents of ge healthcare’s 3h and 14c catalog radiochemicals scintillation proximity assay “spa” reagents and cytostart plate portfolios for aggregate consideration of 120 million in cash the catalog radiochemical products are used for a variety of research applications including screening of potential drug candidates through binding assays the spa beadbased lightemitting assay and cytostart plate technologies are offerings that enable the automation of high throughput screening “hts” processes to help drug discovery researchers determine if potential new drug compounds are effective against their intended disease targets we expect that incorporation of these technologies will strengthen our gproteincoupled receptor and kinase research product lines and complement our hts and research reagent solutions the core technology and patents that we purchased do not meet the definition of a business as the purchased assets were not accompanied by any associated processes purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we report the amortization of these intangible assets within the results of our human health segment from the purchase date 

  

acquisition of symbio lifescience co ltd in august 2009 we acquired the outstanding equity interests of symbio lifescience co ltd “symbio” symbio is a major supplier of diagnostics instruments and related reagents particularly in the area of infectious diseases to hospitals in china we expect this acquisition to expand our access to the hospital market segment in china offering a larger base from which to expand our prenatal and newborn screening business in the country and providing us with a significant diagnostics manufacturing and research and development base within china the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforce acquired we paid the shareholders of symbio approximately 512 million in cash for this acquisition plus an additional amount of 125 million held in an escrow account for contingencies of which 73 million is for potential additional contingent consideration with a fair value of 69 million at the acquisition date we report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our human health segment from the acquisition date 

  

acquisition of analytica of branford inc in may 2009 we acquired the outstanding stock of analytica of branford inc “analytica” analytica is a leading developer of mass spectrometry and ion source technology we expect this acquisition to allow us to offer our customers access to critical technologies such as timeofflight and quadrupole mass spectrometers and new ion sources that provide more complete information as well as better throughput we also gained significant intellectual property in the field of mass spectrometry and ion source technology the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the employee workforce acquired we paid the shareholders of analytica approximately 217 million in cash for this acquisition plus up to 13 million in additional consideration which we expect to pay during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 we report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our environmental health segment from the acquisition date 

  

acquisition of opto technology inc in january 2009 we acquired the outstanding stock of opto technology inc “opto technology” opto technology is a supplier of lightemitting diode “led” based lighting components and subsystems we expect this acquisition to expand our portfolio of high brightness led components by adding optical subsystems to provide energy efficient solid state lighting solutions to original equipment manufacturers the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as noncapitalizable intangible assets such as the customer base acquired we paid the shareholders of opto technology approximately 206 million in cash for this acquisition plus up to 80 million in potential additional contingent consideration of which we recorded 49 million as the fair value at the acquisition date during fiscal year 2009 we recorded a decrease of 02 million to the potential additional contingent consideration as a fair value adjustment through current period 

  

earnings during fiscal year 2009 we received approximately 02 million from the former shareholders of opto technology for net working capital adjustments we report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our environmental health segment from the acquisition date 

  

we recently took the following actions to further strengthen our core businesses 

  

restructuring 

  

during fiscal year 2009 we incurred 92 million pretax restructuring charge in the human health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facilities we also recognized an 110 million pretax restructuring charge in the environmental health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of an excess facility our management approved these plans principally to reduce resources in anticipation of the economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets and to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets the pretax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect the impact of immediate cost savings from the restructuring plans on operating results and cash flows to approximately offset the decline in revenue we expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible as we will incur offsetting costs 

  

discontinued operations 

  

photonics and photoflash businesses divesture in december 2008 as part of our new strategic business alignment into the human health and environmental health segments and our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities our management approved separate plans to divest our photonics and photoflash businesses within our environmental health segment our photonics and photoflash products and technologies include xenon flashtubes and modules these products are used in a variety of applications including mobile phones and laser machine tools the distressed economic conditions during fiscal year 2009 adversely impacted our plan to market and sell the photonics and photoflash businesses we initiated necessary actions during fiscal year 2009 to respond to these changing circumstances and continued to actively market these businesses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 we determined that we could not effectively market and sell the photonics business given the changed circumstances and after careful consideration we decided to cease our plan to actively market and sell the photonics business the photonics business is no longer reflected as discontinued operations however we remain committed to a plan to actively market and sell the photoflash business this business continues to be reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10k see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional details 

  

as part of our ongoing business strategy we also took the following action 

  

share repurchase program 

  

on october 23 2008 we announced that our board of directors our “board” authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million additional shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the “new repurchase program” the new repurchase program will expire on october 22 2012 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2008 we repurchased approximately 10 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 180 million including commissions under the new repurchase program during fiscal year 2009 we repurchased approximately 10 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 142 million including commissions under the new repurchase program 

  

business segments and products 

  

we report our business in two segments human health and environmental health we announced a new alignment of our businesses effective at the start of fiscal year 2009 that allows us to prioritize our capabilities in two key strategic operating areas we reorganized into these two new operating segments to align our resources to meet the demands of the markets we serve and to focus on the important outcomes enabled by our technologies the results reported for fiscal year 2009 reflect this new alignment of our operating segments financial information in this report relating to fiscal years 2008 and 2007 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes in our operating segments in conjunction with the realignment of our operating segments we also redefined the reporting units we use to test for the impairment of goodwill related to our businesses we performed our annual impairment testing as of january 1 2009 our annual impairment date for our reporting units and based on the first step of the impairment process the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment

marketing 

  

all of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces as of january 3 2010 we employed approximately 2800 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35 countries and marketing products and services in more than 150 countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials key components and supplies 

  

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with certain of our suppliers for certain critical raw materials key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components see further description in the applicable risk factor under “item 1a risk factors” 

  

intellectual property 

  

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties we are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights see “item 3 legal proceedings” for a discussion of these matters 

  

backlog 

  

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

  

due to the wide range of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors this affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation operational efficiency product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market niches we do 

  

compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale of specialty flashtubes for industrial applications and ultra specialty lighting sources photo detectors and photodiodes and switched power supplies we expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

we believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenditures were approximately 1073 million during fiscal year 2009 approximately 1089 million during fiscal year 2008 and approximately 1064 million during fiscal year 2007 the fiscal year 2007 amount included an inprocess research and development “iprd” charge of 15 million related to the acquisitions of evotec technologies gmbh and euroscreen products sa in january 2007 

  

we directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental and safety and security markets within our environmental health segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives we expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2010 and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our human health segment and the environmental and safety and security markets within our environmental health segment 

  

environmental matters 

  

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 46 million as of january 3 2010 which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

in addition during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 we settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred at our facility in boston massachusetts in march 2005 we accrued 97 million representing 

  

management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building including environmental matters which was damaged in the fire we paid 25 million during fiscal year 2009 16 million during fiscal year 2008 and 39 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building we anticipate that the remaining accrual of 17 million will be settled by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 we are actively marketing and have a plan to sell the building 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

  

as of january 3 2010 we employed approximately 8200 employees in continuing operations several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of january 3 2010 we employed an aggregate of approximately 1200 union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 

  

financial information about reporting segments 

  

the assets and expenses for our corporate headquarters such as legal tax audit human resources information technology and other management and compliance costs have been included as “corporate” below we have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when such costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses these amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments 

  

the table below sets forth sales and operating income loss by reporting segment for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 

  

   

discontinued operations have not been included in the preceding table 

  

additional information relating to our reporting segments for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 is as follows 

  

   

  

   

financial information about geographic areas 

  

both of our reporting segments conduct business in and derive substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during fiscal year 2009 we had 10793 million in sales from our international operations representing approximately 60 of our total sales during fiscal year 2009 we derived approximately 32 of our international sales from our human health segment and approximately 68 of our international sales from our environmental health segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future 

  

we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements additional geographic information is discussed in note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

  

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

  

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly sales and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected 

  

trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding restrictions in capital expenditures general economic conditions cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability for example revenues and profits declined in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 at least partially as a result of these factors 

  

our growth is subject to global economic political and other risks 

  

we have operations in many parts of the world the health of the global economy has a significant impact on our business since 2008 worldwide economic conditions have experienced a severe downturn due to the sequential effects of the credit market crisis and the resulting impact on the finance and banking industries volatile currency exchange rates and energy costs inflation concerns decreased consumer confidence reduced corporate profits and capital expenditures and liquidity concerns for example the continuing tightening of credit in the financial markets may make it more difficult for customers to obtain financing for their operations resulting in a material decrease in the orders we receive our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location in addition our global manufacturing facilities face risks to their production capacity that may relate to natural disasters labor relations or regulatory compliance while certain of these risks can be hedged in a limited way using financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful in addition our ability to engage in such mitigation has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

  

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

  

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the 

  

commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential sales revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

  

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

  

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable or successfully divest businesses 

  

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as opto technology inc acquired in january 2009 analytica of branford inc acquired in may 2009 and symbio lifescience co ltd acquired in august 2009 however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences unforeseen regulatory requirements previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results additionally if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

  

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies which expenses may adversely impact our profitability 

  

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

  

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

  

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend 

  

against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

  

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

  

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

  

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

  

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

  

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

  

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

  

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the united states postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

  

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components certain analytical instrumentation and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

  

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components analytical instrumentation and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components analytical instrumentation and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers or strategic relationships to supply critical materials and analytical instrumentation or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components analytical instrumentation and other goods could usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components analytical instrumentation or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

  

the manufacture and sale of products may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

  

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

  

our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries if we fail to comply with those regulations we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions some of the products produced by our human health segment are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales resales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar foreign and domestic agencies we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

  

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

  

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

  

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

  

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

  

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

  

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total sales in the fiscal year ended january 3 2010 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

  

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

  

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

if we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on several centralized information systems throughout our company to keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers and suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business 

  

restrictions in our credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

  

our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 6 senior unsecured notes contain and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company these debt instruments include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 

  

our failure to comply with any of these restrictions in our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 6 senior unsecured notes may result in an event of default under either or both of these debt instruments which could permit acceleration of the debt under either or both debt instruments and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date 

  

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

  

as of january 3 2010 our total assets included 19 billion of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights core technology and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible assets 

  

adverse changes in our business adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units or the failure to grow our human health and environmental health segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our share price will fluctuate 

  

over the last several quarters stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 

  

   

   

   

   

   

dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

  

on october 21 2009 we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 which was paid in january 2010 on january 25 2010 we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 that is payable in may 2010 in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc collectively “enzo” filed a complaint dated october 23 2002 in the united states district court for the southern district of new york civil action no 028448 against amersham plc amersham biosciences perkinelmer inc perkinelmer life sciences inc sigmaaldrich corporation sigma chemical company inc molecular probes inc and orchid biosciences inc the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo infringed enzo’s patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against enzo by among other things engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo’s patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief in 2003 the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants we subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo’s patents are invalid in july 2006 the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and we believe excludes certain of our products from the coverage of enzo’s patents summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in january 2007 and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in july 2007 in january 2009 the case was assigned to a new district court judge and in march 2009 the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decides enzo’s appeal of the judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut in enzo biochem vs applera corp and tropix inc which involves a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of enzo’s case against us 

  

pharmastem therapeutics inc “pharmastem” filed a complaint dated february 22 2002 against viacell inc “viacell” which is now our wholly owned subsidiary and several other defendants in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging infringement of united states patents no 5004681 and no 5192553 relating to certain aspects of the collection cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood “pharmastem i” after several years of proceedings at the district court level the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a decision in july 2007 that viacell did not infringe these two patents and that the two patents are invalid pharmastem filed a certiorari petition in january 2008 seeking to have the united states supreme court review the appellate court’s decision as to the invalidity of the patents but did not seek any further review of the noninfringement decision however 

  

the united states supreme court denied certiorari in march 2008 so the decision by the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit in favor of viacell is final and nonappealable pharmastem had also filed a second complaint against viacell and other defendants in july 2004 in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts alleging infringement of united states patents no 6461645 and 6569427 which also relate to certain aspects of the collection cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood “pharmastem ii” the delaware court granted viacell’s motion in october 2005 to stay the proceedings in pharmastem ii pending the outcome of pharmastem i and a decision from the united states patent and trademark office “us pto” on certain patent reexamination issues on september 2 2008 the us pto issued a reexamination certificate cancelling all claims of united states patent no 6461645 and on september 16 2008 the us pto issued a reexamination certificate cancelling all claims of united states patent no 6569427 as a result of the cancellation of all patent claims involved in pharmastem ii by the us pto we sought and in december 2009 the court entered a stipulation of dismissal dismissing all claims between the parties with prejudice 

  

we believe we have meritorious defenses to these open lawsuits described above and other proceedings and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above unresolved matters while each of these matters is subject to uncertainty in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at january 3 2010 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

overview of fiscal year 2009 

  

the global economic contraction negatively affected certain of our end markets during fiscal year 2009 however several of our other end markets performed better than we anticipated our overall sales in fiscal year 2009 declined 1478 million or 8 as compared to fiscal year 2008 reflecting a decline of 381 million or 5 in our human health segment sales and a decline of 1097 million or 9 in our environmental health segment sales this decline in our human health segment sales during fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to decreased demand for our medical imaging products in the diagnostics market as well as order deferrals related to fiscal year 2009 delays in government stimulus monies in the research market the decreased demand for our medical imaging products resulted from continued constraints on medical providers’ capital budgets and a lack of financing availability for our customers the government stimulus related order delays in the research market resulted from many of our customers continuing to defer instrument purchases in hopes of obtaining grants for larger instrument purchases the decline in our environmental health segment sales during fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to the decline in spending by private and public testing labs and continued weak demand in detection and intrusion sensors in the environmental and safety and security markets as well as traditional chemical and semiconductor markets reducing capital purchases in response to continued tight capital budgets and difficulty accessing credit markets 

  

these declines have been offset in part by certain of our businesses operating in markets which are more isolated from current economic trends or where our businesses have benefited from a push for more efficient spending in our human health segment we experienced strong growth in sales in the diagnostics market related to our genetic screening business during fiscal year 2009 as compared to that market in fiscal year 2008 the genetic screening business was driven by continued expansion of neonatal and prenatal screening platforms with broadbased growth experienced across all major geographies we expanded newborn screening in china through our recent symbio acquisition and also advanced adoption and capacity of first trimester prenatal screening setting up national labs in new zealand the philippines vietnam and malaysia our cord blood business also contributed to the growth of our genetic screening business during fiscal year 2009 in the research market demand for our reagents and lowend instrumentation was encouraging as customers continued to spend on basic research as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers we anticipate that while there is continued pressure on lab budgets and credit availability the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease which can result in savings of longterm health care cost as well as creating better outcomes for patients are increasingly valued and we will continue to see growth in these markets 

  

in our environmental health segment our laboratory services business enables our customers to drive efficiencies increase production time and reduce maintenance costs all of which are increasingly critical in this distressed economic environment during fiscal year 2009 we continued to grow by adding new customers to our onesource multivendor service and expanding in markets beyond our traditional customer base and services we were also encouraged by improving demand trends in our traditional service offerings which we believe are indicative of improving economic confidence while overall sales in the environmental and safety and security markets were driven down by the decline in spending by private and public testing labs and the decline in spending for detection and intrusion sensors sales of environmental food and consumer safety testing products grew in fiscal year 2009 due to increased demand for the production and analysis of renewable energy technologies and new testing requirements for consumer product safety applications as a result of new regulations we experienced increased demand from government agencies in china for products with food safety 

  

and consumer safety applications to comply with recently adopted regulatory requirements in the united states we believe that the need for increased inspection testing and tracking of contaminants will continue to drive increased demand for our products 

  

our gross margins increased approximately 42 basis points in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 due to changes in product mix especially growth in sales of higher gross margin product offerings and cost containment initiatives partially offset by lower demand however our consolidated operating margin declined approximately 177 basis points in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 primarily as a result of lower demand additional restructuring activities increased sales and marketing expenses particularly in emerging territories increased pension expenses and foreign exchange partially offset by cost containment initiatives 

  

we believe we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of our end markets where spending trends have countered the prevailing downturn and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services overall we believe that our strategic focus on human health and environmental health coupled with our breadth of end markets deep portfolio of technologies and applications leading market positions global scale and financial strength will provide us with a strong foundation to weather the current economic climate

completed in fiscal year 2009 added an expense of approximately 14 million for fiscal year 2009 the increase in gross margin was primarily the result of the combined favorable impact of changes in product mix especially growth in sales of higher gross margin product offerings productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives partially offset by lower demand 

  

2008 compared to 2007 cost of sales for fiscal year 2008 was 11249 million as compared to 10164 million for fiscal year 2007 an increase of approximately 1086 million or 11 as a percentage of sales cost of sales decreased to 574 in fiscal year 2008 from 588 in fiscal year 2007 resulting in an increase in gross margin of 140 basis points to 426 in fiscal year 2008 from 412 in fiscal year 2007 amortization of intangible assets increased and was 374 million for fiscal year 2008 as compared to 344 million for fiscal year 2007 stock option expense increased and was 17 million for fiscal year 2008 as compared to 12 million for fiscal year 2007 the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2007 added an expense of approximately 25 million for fiscal year 2007 the increase in gross margin was primarily the result of the combined favorable impact of increased sales volume productivity improvements and growth in higher gross margin products such as viacord ®  partially offset by increased freight costs

2008 compared to 2007 selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2008 were 5248 million as compared to 4412 million for fiscal year 2007 an increase of approximately 836 million or 19 as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses were 268 in fiscal year 2008 compared to 255 in fiscal year 2007 amortization of intangible assets increased and was 161 million for fiscal year 2008 as compared to 79 million for fiscal year 2007 stock option expense increased and was 82 million for fiscal year 2008 as compared to 73 million for fiscal year 2007 this increase was primarily the result of increased sales and marketing expenses to support recent acquisitions particularly the acquisition of viacell increased employeerelated expenses to support our sales initiatives and foreign exchange

restructuring and lease charges net 

  

we have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures alignment with our growth strategy and the integration of our business units restructuring and lease charges net for fiscal year 2009 were a 202 million charge as compared to a 69 million charge for fiscal year 2008 and a 144 million charge for fiscal year 2007 

  

the following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 

  

   

the restructuring plan for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 was intended principally to reduce resources in anticipation of the economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets and to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets the restructuring plan for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 was intended principally to reduce resources in anticipation of the economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets the restructuring plan for the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 was intended principally to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy the activities associated with these plans have been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect the impact of immediate cost savings from the restructuring plans on operating results and cash flows to approximately offset the decline in revenue we expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible as we will incur offsetting costs 

  

q3 2009 plan 

  

during the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 our management approved a plan to reduce resources in anticipation of the economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets and to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets the “q3 2009 plan” as a result of the q3 2009 plan we recognized a 49 million pretax restructuring charge in our human health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of an excess facility we also recognized a 73 million pretax restructuring charge in our environmental health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities

previous restructuring and integration plans

lease charges 

  

to facilitate the sale of a business in fiscal year 2001 we were required to guarantee the lease obligations that the buyer assumed related to the lease for the building in which the business operated the lease obligations continue through march 2011 while we assigned our interest in the lease to the buyer at the time of the sale of the business the buyer subsequently defaulted under the lease and the lessor sought reimbursement from us we recorded a charge of 27 million in fiscal year 2007 related to payments for this lease obligation the buyer filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 and was delinquent in making both its lease payments and payments for certain building expenses the buyer ceased operations in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 and vacated the property we recorded an additional charge of 09 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 related to waste removal and restoration costs and reduced the estimated sublease rental payments reasonably expected to be obtained for the property we were required to make payments for these obligations of 04 million during fiscal year 2008 and 11 million during fiscal year 2009 

  

gains on settlement of insurance claim 

  

2009 compared to 2008 there were no gains on settlement of insurance claim in fiscal years 2009 and 2008

72 million related to business interruption costs which were recorded as reductions to cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses we accrued 97 million representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building including environmental matters which was damaged in the fire we paid 25 million during fiscal year 2009 16 million during fiscal year 2008 and 39 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building we anticipate that the remaining accrual of 17 million will be settled by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 we are actively marketing and have a plan to sell the building 

  

inprocess research and development charge 

  

2009 compared to 2008  in december 2007 the fasb issued authoritative guidance on business combinations under this guidance iprd is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the product is ready for sale we did not have an iprd charge in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 

  

2008 compared to 2007 we did not have an iprd charge in fiscal year 2008 the iprd charge for fiscal year 2007 was 15 million which related to the acquisitions of evotec technologies gmbh and euroscreen products sa in january 2007 in determining the value of the inprocess projects we considered among other factors the inprocess projects’ stage of completion the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date the costs already incurred the projected costs to complete the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology we utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the iprd using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch this approach determines fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to an inprocess project over its useful life and then discounting these aftertax cash flows back to a present value we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value of each project at the acquisition date and the amount represents management’s best estimate of the amount a third party would pay for the projects 

  

interest and other expense net 

  

interest and other expense net consisted of the following 

  

   

2009 compared to 2008 interest and other expense net for fiscal year 2009 was 169 million as compared to 456 million for fiscal year 2008 a decrease of 287 million the decrease in interest and other expense net in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to the discontinuance and settlement of forward interest rate contracts with a 175 million loss that was recognized into interest expense during fiscal year 2008 as well as lower interest rates on outstanding debt balances partially offset by the increase in the mix of fixed rate versus variable rate debt interest income decreased 30 million as a result of lower interest rates on lower cash balances other expenses for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 decreased by 73 million and consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency transactions and foreign currency translation a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

2008 compared to 2007 interest and other expense net for fiscal year 2008 was 456 million as compared to 169 million for fiscal year 2007 an increase of 287 million the increase in interest and other expense net in fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to the discontinuance and settlement of forward interest rate contracts with a 175 million loss that was recognized into interest expense during fiscal year 2008 and higher outstanding debt balances primarily related to our purchase of viacell in fiscal year 2007 which was partially offset by lower interest rates on those outstanding debt balances interest income decreased 07 million as a result of lower interest rates which were partially offset by higher cash balances other expenses for fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 increased by 12 million and consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency transactions and foreign currency translation 

  

provision for income taxes

in october 2008 the tax relief and health care act of 2008 the “2008 tax act” was enacted the 2008 tax act retroactively restored expired research and experimental tax credit provisions and extended the credit through december 31 2009 as a result of the 2008 tax act we recorded a benefit for the research and experimental tax credit in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 in the amount of 08 million for each year

contingencies including tax matters

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at january 3 2010 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in 

  

this annual report on form 10k however each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

capital expenditures 

  

during fiscal year 2010 we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2009 primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

  

at january 3 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1797 million and an amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility with 2310 million available for additional borrowing in may 2008 we finalized an issuance of 6 sevenyear senior unsecured notes with proceeds of approximately 1500 million the proceeds from this debt issuance were used to repay existing borrowings under our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility most of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed 

  

on november 6 2006 we announced that our board authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the “repurchase program” the repurchase program would have expired on october 25 2010 unless terminated earlier by our board and could have been suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2007 we repurchased in the open market approximately 81 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 2030 million including commissions under the repurchase program during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 we repurchased 19 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 566 million including commissions under the repurchase program these repurchases completed our repurchase of the 100 million shares in the aggregate authorized under the repurchase program 

  

on october 23 2008 we announced that our board authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million additional shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the “new repurchase program” the new repurchase program will expire on october 22 2012 unless terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2008 we repurchased approximately 10 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 180 million including commissions under the new repurchase program during fiscal year 2009 we repurchased approximately 10 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 142 million including commissions under the new repurchase program 

  

our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans during fiscal year 2009 we repurchased 28890 shares of common stock for this purpose during fiscal year 2008 we repurchased 37521 shares of common stock the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value 

  

the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

on november 5 2009 the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 was enacted and allows businesses with net operating losses for 2008 or 2009 to carry back those losses for up to five years we expect to carry back losses of up to 800 million from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2005 we expect this carryback will result in a federal income tax refund of up to 280 million in fiscal year 2010 

  

in connection with the settlement of an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred at our facility in boston massachusetts in march 2005 we accrued 97 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building including environmental matters which was damaged in the fire we paid 25 million during fiscal year 2009 16 million during fiscal year 2008 and 39 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building we anticipate that the remaining accrual of 17 million will be settled by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 we are actively marketing and have a plan to sell the building 

  

distressed global financial markets have adversely impacted general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability creating increased volatility in security prices widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations we cannot predict how long these conditions will exist or how our businesses may be affected in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

  

our pension plans have not experienced any material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets however as a result of losses experienced in global equity markets our pension funds had a negative return for fiscal year 2008 offset by modest gains for fiscal year 2009 which in turn created increased pension costs in fiscal year 2009 and potentially in additional future periods for all pension plans we may be required to fund our pension plans outside the united states with a contribution of up to 115 million by the end of fiscal year 2010 and we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in 

  

future periods for all pension plans additionally we expect to contribute up to 200 million to the pension plan in the united states during fiscal year 2010 for the 2009 plan year in connection with the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 as described above

effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the accounting for transfers of financial assets this guidance is intended to improve practices that have developed that are not consistent with the original intent and key requirements of the original disclosure requirements including establishing a new “participating interest” definition that must be met for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting clarifying and amending the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale and changing the amount that can be recognized as a gain or loss on a transfer accounted for as a sale when beneficial interests are received by the transferor this guidance also requires enhanced disclosures to provide information about transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on the accounting for transfers of financial assets in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 we expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 

  

in june 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities this guidance requires an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity based on whether the entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity also this guidance requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary and amends the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a variable interest entity enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about an enterprise’s involvement in a variable interest entity we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 we expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 

  

in october 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance on multipledeliverable revenue arrangements this guidance establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenuegenerating activities this guidance provides amendments to the criteria for separating and measuring deliverables and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting the amendments in this guidance also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor’s multipledeliverable revenue arrangements including information about the nature and terms of significant deliverables and a vendor’s performance within those arrangements the amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative sellingprice method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on multipledeliverable revenue arrangements in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 we are currently evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements 

  

in october 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance on certain revenue arrangements that include software elements this guidance changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are “essential to the functionality” of the product and excludes these products from current software revenue guidance the new guidance will include factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered “essential to the functionality” once adopted the amendments will subject softwareenabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements such as guidance 

  

surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on certain revenue arrangements that include software elements in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 we are currently evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them when arrangements include multiple elements we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings 

  

inventory valuation we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase andor manufacture we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

  

business combinations business combinations are accounted for at fair value acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses noncontrolling interests are valued at fair value at the acquisition date iprd is recorded at fair value as an indefinitelived intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect income tax expense all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets 

  

value of longlived assets including intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the goodwill impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized  in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite the assets will be tested for impairment these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization through fiscal year 2009 we assessed the annual impairment testing using the analytical sciences and laboratory services illumination and detection solutions genetic screening biodiscovery and medical imaging reporting units we completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of january 3 2010 and december 28 2008 and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 

  

employee compensation and benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we incurred expenses of 130 million in fiscal year 2009 83 million in fiscal year 2008 and 125 million in fiscal year 2007 for our retirement and postretirement plans we expect expenses of approximately 155 million in fiscal year 2010 for our retirement and postretirement plans pension accounting is intended to reflect the 

  

recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year as of january 3 2010 we estimated the expected longterm rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was 85 and was 72 for all plans outside the united states we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates at the measurement date if any of our assumptions were to change our pension plan expenses would also change a onequarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by 05 million for fiscal year 2010 in the united states and by 06 million for fiscal year 2010 for all plans outside the united states a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pretax pension expense by 24 million for fiscal year 2010 in the united states and by 09 million for fiscal year 2010 for all plans outside the united states we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

  

restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and iii asset impairments as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statement of operations line entitled “restructuring and lease charges reversals net” 

  

gains or losses on dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the fiscal year ended january 3 2010 we did not recognize any gains or losses from disposition of fixed assets we recorded 21 million in losses from the disposition of discontinued operations any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the “gains on disposition” or “discontinued operations” line items appearing in our consolidated statement of operations 

  

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and 

  

deferred tax provisions any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

  

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

  

additionally we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits other income tax credits and certain pension accruals valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable improvements or other changes in our operations domestically and internationally could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial instruments 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january 3 2010 

  

we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments by nature all financial instruments involve market and credit risks we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments approximately 60 of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies the fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing investing and operating the business the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings we did not have any outstanding cash flow hedges during fiscal year 2009 

  

principal hedged currencies include the british pound gbp canadian dollar cad euro eur japanese yen jpy and singapore dollar sgd we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us equivalent notional amounts totaling 1685 million at january 3 2010 and 1608 million at december 28 2008 and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material the duration of these contracts was generally 30 days during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 

  

we entered into forward interest rate contracts in october 2007 with notional amounts totaling 3000 million and a weighted average interest rate of 425 that were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance in may 2008 we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million upon the issuance of our 6 senior unsecured notes and recognized 84 million net of taxes of 54 million of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive loss income during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance with a notional amount totaling 1500 million was no longer probable as a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million and recognized a loss of 175 million in interest and other expense net as of january 3 2010 the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss income related to the effective cash flow hedges was 65 million net of taxes of 42 million the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense we amortized into interest expense 20 million during fiscal year 2009 and 12 million during fiscal year 2008 for these derivative losses 

  

market risk 

  

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 60 of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in a natural hedge 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days as of january 3 2010 this computation estimated that there is a 5 chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 04 million this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2009 the valueatrisk ranged between 04 million and 09 million with an average of approximately 05 million 

  

interest rate risk as described above our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and 

  

our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

  

we entered into forward interest rate contracts in october 2007 with notional amounts totaling 3000 million and a weighted average interest rate of 425 that were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance in may 2008 we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million upon the issuance of our 6 senior unsecured notes and recognized 84 million net of taxes of 54 million of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive loss income during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance with a notional amount totaling 1500 million was no longer probable as a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million and recognized a loss of 175 million in interest and other expense net as of january 3 2010 the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss income related to the effective cash flow hedges was 65 million net of taxes of 42 million the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense we amortized into interest expense 20 million during fiscal year 2009 and 12 million during fiscal year 2008 for these derivative losses 

  

interest rate risk—sensitivity  as of january 3 2010 our debt portfolio consisted of 4060 million of variable rate debt in addition our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 1797 million at january 3 2010 our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

i changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt consisting of 4060 million of revolving debt facilities to fluctuate an increase of 10 or approximately 7 basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pretax charge to our earnings of 03 million for fiscal year 2010 

  

ii changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate as described above an increase of 10 or approximately 7 basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 03 million for fiscal year 2010 

  

iii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 3 2010 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended january 3 2010 of the company and our report dated march 1 2010 which report expresses an unqualified opinion and includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the change in its method of accounting for business combinations on december 29 2008 on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

recent developments 

  

as part of our strategy to grow our core businesses we have taken the following actions 

  

strategic business realignment 

  

in november 2008 we announced a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year 2009 that will allow us to prioritize our capabilities on two key strategic areas – human health and environmental health our new human health segment concentrates on developing diagnostics tools and applications to detect disease earlier and more accurately and to accelerate the discovery and development of critical new therapies our new environmental health segment provides technologies and applications to facilitate the creation of safer products more secure surroundings and efficient energy resources as part of this new alignment we placed our photonics and photoflash businesses from our optoelectronics segment under strategic review and created separate plans to divest these businesses 

  

we reported our financial results through fiscal year 2008 using the two reporting segments of life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics beginning in fiscal year 2009 we will report our financial results under the human health and environmental health segments to reflect our new business alignment 

  

acquisitions 

  

acquisition of opto technology inc in january 2009 we acquired opto technology inc “opto technology” a supplier of lightemitting diode based lighting components and subsystems we expect this acquisition to expand our portfolio of high brightness led components by adding optical subsystems to provide energy efficient solid state lighting solutions to original equipment manufacturers we paid the shareholders of opto technology approximately 210 million in cash plus a potential of 80 million in additional contingent consideration 

  

acquisition of arnel inc in december 2008 we acquired arnel inc “arnel” a provider of custom engineered solutions for gas chromatography applications in the petrochemical food and beverage and industrial hygiene markets we expect this acquisition to expand our chromatography portfolio and strengthen our applicationfocused products to better serve the biofuels and hydrocarbon processing industries we paid the shareholders of arnel approximately 20 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration 

  

acquisition of vaconics lighting inc  in may 2008 we acquired vaconics lighting inc “vaconics” a leading provider of custom and standard ceramic xenon arc lamps we expect this acquisition to expand our xenon lighting technology by increasing our offerings of lamp products that include medical endoscopes surgical headlamps forensic analyses video projectors searchlights and infrared lighting we paid approximately 39 million in cash for vaconics’ assets 

  

acquisition of labmetrix technologies sa in march 2008 we acquired labmetrix technologies sa “labmetrix” labmetrix technologies ltd and labmetrix technologies inc a provider of metrologybased multivendor analytical instrument qualification solutions we expect this acquisition to add technology tools processes and compliance expertise to our suite of onesource ® laboratory services by strengthening our support of customers in a wide range of industries including the pharmaceutical medical device food toy and other consumer goods industries we paid the shareholders of labmetrix approximately 43 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration 

  

acquisition of newborn metabolic screening business from pediatrix medical group inc in february 2008 we acquired pediatrix screening inc which constituted the newborn metabolic screening business of pediatrix medical group inc and is now known as perkinelmer genetics inc “pki genetics” pki genetics provides neonatal screening and consultative services to hospitals medical groups and various states we expect this acquisition to expand our capabilities to supply state laboratories and other agencies with comprehensive newborn screening solutions we initially paid pediatrix medical group inc approximately 663 million in cash during the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 we received approximately 03 million from pediatrix medical group inc for net working capital adjustments during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 we paid approximately 23 million to pediatrix medical group inc as additional purchase price for the election to treat the acquisition as a deemed asset sale 

  

we took the following actions to further strengthen our core businesses 

  

restructuring 

  

during fiscal year 2008 we incurred 66 million pretax restructuring charge in the life and analytical sciences segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facilities we also recognized a 04 million pretax restructuring reversal in the optoelectronics segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities our management approved a plan to shift resources into product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy the pretax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect the impact of immediate and future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible as we have incurred and will incur offsetting costs 

  

discontinued operations 

  

photonics and photoflash businesses divesture in december 2008 as part of our new strategic business alignment into the human health and environmental health segments and our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities our management approved separate plans to sell our photonics and photoflash businesses within our optoelectronics segment our photonics and photoflash products and technologies include xenon flashtubes and intense pulsed light these products are used in a variety of applications including mobile phones and laser machine tools we have reflected these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10k we are actively marketing and are currently committed to a plan to sell both of these businesses 

  

certain instrument businesses shut down in december 2008 as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities our management approved the shut down of certain instrument businesses within our life and analytical sciences segment cellular screening fluorescence and luminescence workstations analytical proteomics instruments and proteomics and genomics instruments we have reflected these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10k the cellular fluorescence and luminescence workstations business included products focused on cellular imaging for kinetic and glow luminescence assays the analytical proteomics instruments business and the proteomics and genomics instruments businesses included products for bioimaging mass spectrometers for protein identification high resolution multicolor fluorescence gel imagers spot detection and spot excision instruments as well as laser scanners for slide based microarray image analysis we continue to serve the cellular screening proteomics and genomics consumable and reagents markets the shut down of the cellular screening fluorescence and luminescence workstations business analytical proteomics instruments business and proteomics and genomics instruments business in december 2008 resulted in a 48 million loss related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value 

  

viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses shut down following the viacell acquisition our board of directors the “board” approved a plan to sell the viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses that were acquired with our acquisition of viacell inc in november 2007 the viacyte sm business focused on the development of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized 

  

oocytes the cellular therapy technology business focused on the development and sale of unrestricted somatic stem cell products which are derived from umbilical cord blood we determined that both businesses do not strategically fit with the other products offered by our life and analytical sciences segment we also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses we could not effectively compete with larger companies that focus on the market for such products after careful consideration we decided in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 to shut down the viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses recording a pretax loss of 80 million for severance and facility closure costs we have classified the results and shut down of the viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional details 

  

as part of our strategy we also took the following actions 

  

share repurchase program 

  

on november 6 2006 we announced that our board authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the “repurchase program” during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 we repurchased 19 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 566 million including commissions under the repurchase program these repurchases completed the repurchase of the 100 million shares in the aggregate authorized under the repurchase program on october 23 2008 we announced that our board has authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million additional shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program the “new repurchase program” the new repurchase program will expire on october 22 2012 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by the board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal year 2008 we repurchased approximately 10 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 180 million including commissions under the new repurchase program from december 29 2008 through february 20 2009 we repurchased approximately 10 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 142 million including commissions under the new repurchase program

marketing 

  

all of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces as of december 28 2008 we employed approximately 2600 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35 countries and marketing products and services in more than 150 countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials and supplies 

  

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with certain of our suppliers for certain critical raw materials and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials see further description in the applicable risk factor under “item 1a risk factors” 

  

intellectual property 

  

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties we are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights see “item 3 legal proceedings” for a discussion of these matters 

  

backlog 

  

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

  

due to the wide range of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors this affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

in our life and analytical sciences segment we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market niches we expect the proportion of large competitors in this reporting segment to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

we do not believe any single competitor competes directly with our optoelectronics segment across its full product range however we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale of specialty flashtubes for industrial applications and ultra specialty lighting sources photo detectors and photodiodes and switched power supplies competition is based on price technological innovation operational efficiency and product reliability and quality 

  

we believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenditures were approximately 1081 million during fiscal year 2008 approximately 1055 million during fiscal year 2007 and approximately 934 million during fiscal year 2006 the fiscal year 2007 amount included an inprocess research and development “iprd” charge of 15 million related to the acquisitions of evotec technologies gmbh and euroscreen products sa in january 2007 

  

we directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 primarily toward genetic screening biodiscovery and analytical sciences markets within our life and analytical sciences segment and medical imaging and photonics markets within our optoelectronics segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives we expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2009 and to continue to emphasize the genetic screening biodiscovery and medical imaging markets within our human health segment and the analytical sciences market within our environmental health segment 

  

environmental matters 

  

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 40 million as of december 28 2008 which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

in addition we accrued 97 million during fiscal year 2007 for a fire that occurred within our life and analytical sciences facility in boston massachusetts in march 2005 representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building including environmental matters we paid 16 million during fiscal year 2008 and 39 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building we anticipate that the remaining payments of 42 million will be completed by the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

  

as of december 28 2008 we employed approximately 7900 employees in continuing operations several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of december 28 2008 we employed an aggregate of approximately 1000 union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 

  

financial information about reporting segments 

  

the assets and expenses for our corporate headquarters such as legal tax accounting and finance human resources property and insurance management information technology treasury and other management and compliance costs have been included as “corporate” below we have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when such costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses these amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments 

  

the table below sets forth sales and operating income loss by reporting segment for the 2008 2007 and 2006 fiscal years 

  

   

discontinued operations have not been included in the preceding table 

  

additional information relating to our reporting segments for the 2008 2007 and 2006 fiscal years is as follows 

  

   

   

  

financial information about geographic areas 

  

both of our reporting segments conduct business in and derive substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during fiscal year 2008 we had 11851 million in sales from our international operations representing approximately 60 of our total sales during fiscal year 2008 we derived 

  

approximately 80 of our international sales from our life and analytical sciences segment and approximately 20 of our international sales from our optoelectronics segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future 

  

we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements additional geographic information is discussed in note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

  

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

  

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly sales and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding general economic conditions or cuts in government funding would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

  

our growth is subject to global economic political and other risks 

  

we have operations in many parts of the world the health of the global economy has a significant impact on our business for example the current tightening of credit in the financial markets may make it more difficult for customers to obtain financing for their operations resulting in a material decrease in the orders we receive our business is also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation political changes some of which may be disruptive could interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location in addition our global manufacturing facilities face risks to their production capacity that may relate to natural disasters labor relations or regulatory compliance while some of these risks can be hedged using financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful in addition our ability to engage in such mitigation has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

  

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

  

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory 

  

expertise manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential sales revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

  

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

  

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 

  

we have in the past supplemented and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as viacell inc acquired in november 2007 the newborn metabolic screening business from pediatrix medical group inc acquired in february 2008 labmetrix technologies sa acquired in march 2008 vaconics lighting inc acquired in may 2008 and arnel inc acquired in december 2008 however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we would have to improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences or difficulties in predicting financial results as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

  

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses in evaluating possible acquisitions that we ultimately do not acquire which expenses then may adversely impact our profitability 

  

  

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

  

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

  

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

  

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

  

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

  

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a thirdparty could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

  

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

  

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

  

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

a significant disruption in thirdparty package delivery and importexport services or significant increases in prices for those services could interfere with our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

  

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and importexport companies including ups and federal express in the united states tnt ups and dhl in europe and ups in asia we also ship our products through other carriers including national trucking firms overnight carrier services and the us postal service if one or more of the package delivery or importexport providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers 

  

disruptions in the supply of raw materials certain key components and supplies from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

  

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials key components and supplies could usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials key components or supplies is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

  

the manufacture and sale of products may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

  

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

  

some of the products produced by our life and analytical sciences segment are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar agencies internationally these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales resales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution other aspects of our operations are subject to regulation by different government agencies in the united states and other countries if we fail to comply with those regulations we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions 

  

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

  

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

  

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

  

the healthcare industry including the genetic screening market is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

  

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

  

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total sales in the fiscal year ended december 28 2008 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

  

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 

  

our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans the inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

if we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on several centralized information systems throughout our company to keep financial records process orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions if we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers and suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business 

  

restrictions in our credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities 

  

our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 6 senior unsecured notes contain and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company these debt instruments include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our debt instruments our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 

  

our failure to comply with any of these restrictions in our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 6 senior unsecured notes may result in an event of default under either or both of these debt instruments which could permit acceleration of the debt under either or both debt instruments and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date 

  

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

  

as of december 28 2008 our total assets included 18 billion of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible assets 

  

adverse changes in our business or the failure to grow our life and analytical sciences segment may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our share price will fluctuate 

  

over the last several quarters stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 

  

   

   

   

   

   

dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

  

on january 28 2009 we announced that our board had declared a quarterly dividend of 007 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

 item 2 properties 

  

as of december 28 2008 our continuing operations occupied approximately 2643000 square feet in over 110 locations we own approximately 615000 square feet of this space and lease the balance we conduct our operations in manufacturing and assembly plants research laboratories administrative offices and other facilities located in 11 states and 34 foreign countries 

  

facilities outside of the united states account for approximately 1312000 square feet of our owned and leased property or approximately 50 of our total occupied space 

  

our real property leases are both shortterm and longterm we believe that our properties are wellmaintained and are adequate for our present requirements

we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above unresolved matters while each these matters is subject to uncertainty in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at december 28 2008 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

restructuring and lease charges reversals net 

  

we have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions divestitures and the integration of our business units restructuring actions were recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” “sfas no 146” restructuring and lease charges net for fiscal year 2008 were a 62 million charge as compared to a 122 million charge for fiscal year 2007 

  

the following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 

  

   

  

the purpose of the restructuring plans approved in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 detailed below was principally to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy the pretax restructuring activities associated with these plans have been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect the impact of immediate and future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible as we have incurred and will incur offsetting costs 

  

q3 2008 plan 

  

during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 our management approved a plan to shift resources into product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy the “q3 2008 plan” as a result of the q3 2008 plan we recognized a 75 million pretax restructuring charge in our life and analytical sciences segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facilities we also recognized a 03 million pretax restructuring charge in our optoelectronics segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities 

  

as part of our q3 2008 plan we reduced headcount by 107 employees all actions related to the q3 2008 plan were completed by september 28 2008 all employees have been severed and we anticipate that the remaining payments of 27 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 we also anticipate that the remaining payments of 12 million for the closure of the excess facilities will be paid through fiscal year 2011 in accordance with the terms of the applicable leases

lease charges 

  

to facilitate the sale of a business in fiscal year 2001 we were required to guarantee the obligations that the buyer of the business assumed related to the lease for the building in which the business operates the lease obligations continue through march 2011 while we assigned our interest in the lease to the buyer at the time of the sale of the business in the event the buyer defaults under the lease we are responsible for all remaining lease payments and certain other building related expenses as an additional measure to facilitate the sale of the business we obtained a letter of credit as partial security for a loan to the buyer which could have been drawn upon by the buyer’s lender in the event the buyer was delinquent in repayment of the loan during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 the lessor of the building began the process to evict the buyer as a result of unpaid lease payments and building expenses and sought reimbursement from us as a result of this action we recorded a charge of 45 million related to payments for this lease obligation and the potential drawdown of the letter of credit during the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 the buyer completed a recapitalization of the business with another lender the proceeds of the recapitalization were used to pay off the remaining balance on the original securitized loan as well as to make certain payments to the landlord for back rent and other obligations arising under the lease we were also released from our obligation under the letter of credit on the original securitized loan as a result of these actions we recorded a reversal of 14 million related to payments for this lease obligation and the release of the letter of credit in the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 the buyer made its required payments for lease obligations and building expenses through june 2008 and as a result we recorded an additional reversal of 04 million 

  

the buyer filed for bankruptcy protection on october 27 2008 and was delinquent in making both its lease payments and payments for certain building expenses in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2008 requiring us to make payments of 04 million during fiscal year 2008 and 04 million to date in fiscal year 2009 as of december 28 2008 we are still responsible for the remaining accrual of 24 million which relates to the remaining lease and building obligations through march 2011 reduced by estimated sublease rentals reasonably expected to be obtained for the property

inprocess research and development charge 

  

2008 compared to 2007 we did not have an inprocess research and development “iprd” charge in fiscal year 2008 the iprd charge for fiscal year 2007 was 15 million which related to the acquisitions of evotec technologies gmbh and euroscreen products sa in january 2007 in determining the value of the inprocess projects we considered among other factors the inprocess projects’ stage of completion the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date the costs already incurred the projected costs to complete the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology we utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the iprd using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch this approach determines fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to an 

  

inprocess project over its useful life and then discounting these aftertax cash flows back to a present value we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value of each project at the acquisition date and the amount represents management’s best estimate of the amount a third party would pay for the projects 

  

2007 compared to 2006  we did not have an iprd charge in fiscal year 2006 

  

interest and other expense net 

  

interest and other expense net consisted of the following

discontinued operations 

  

as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have discontinued certain businesses we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” and accordingly have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 

  

we recorded the following gains and losses which have been reported as the loss gain on disposition of discontinued operations during the three years ended

the acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting allocation of the purchase price for the acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques we record the excess purchase price over those assigned values as goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment purchased intangibles with finite lives will be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional details 

  

iprd charges represent incomplete acquired research and development projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use as of the acquisition date technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has completed all planning designing coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions features and technical performance requirements on the date of the acquisitions of evotec and euroscreen there were multiple iprd efforts underway at each company for certain current and future product lines in 

  

determining the value of inprocess projects we consider among other factors the inprocess projects’ stage of completion the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date the costs already incurred the projected costs to complete the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology for these acquisitions we utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the iprd using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch this approach determines fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to an inprocess project over its useful life and then discounting these aftertax cash flows back to a present value for the acquisitions of evotec and euroscreen we estimated the value of the iprd to be 02 million and 13 million respectively we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of the acquisitions and the amount represents management’s best estimate of the amount a third party would pay in the aggregate for the projects the fair value of acquired iprd costs was expensed as of the acquisition date as the projects underway at evotec and euroscreen had not reached technological feasibility and were determined to have no alternative future use 

  

in connection with the purchase price and related allocations for acquisitions we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after consummation the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin thereon the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs in most acquisitions profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling efforts on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition the sum of the costs and operating income approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a thirdparty to assume the obligation as a result of purchase accounting we recognized the deferred revenue related to the viacell acquisition at fair value and did not recognize 181 million of deferred revenue that would have been otherwise recognized in future periods 

  

as of december 28 2008 all purchase price and related allocations are final with the exception of the arnel acquisition which was preliminary as of december 28 2008 the arnel purchase price and related allocations may be revised as a result of adjustments made to the purchase price as well as additional information regarding assets and liabilities assumed including contingent liabilities deferred taxes and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the date of purchase we are not aware of any information that indicates the final purchase price allocation will differ materially from the preliminary estimates and we expect to complete any outstanding asset valuations no later than one year from the date of acquisition 

  

contingencies including tax matters 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 40 million as of december 28 2008 which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant 

  

named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at december 28 2008 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility on august 13 2007 we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility providing for a facility through august 13 2012 which amended and restated in its entirety our previous senior revolving credit agreement dated as of october 31 2005 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we exercised our option to increase the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to 6500 million from 5000 million letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately 140 million were issued under the previous facility which are treated as issued under the amended facility we use the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes which may include working capital refinancing existing indebtedness capital expenditures share repurchases acquisitions and strategic alliances the interest rates under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin or the base rate from time to time the base rate is the higher of i the corporate base rate announced from time to time by bank of america na and ii the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points we may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to interest based upon the eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate the eurocurrency margin as of december 28 2008 was 40 basis points the weighted average eurocurrency interest rate as of december 28 2008 was 063 resulting in a weighted average effective eurocurrency rate including the margin of 103 we had drawn down approximately 3590 million of borrowings in us dollars under the facility as of december 28 2008 with interest based on the above described eurocurrency rate the agreement for the facility contains affirmative negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type and which are consistent with those financial covenants contained in our previous senior revolving credit agreement the financial covenants in our amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility include debttocapital ratios and a contingent maximum total leverage ratio applicable if our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade at all times during fiscal year 2008 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants and anticipate being in compliance for the duration of the term of the credit facility 

  

unsecured interim credit facility on november 14 2007 we entered into a 3000 million unsecured interim credit facility we entered into this unsecured interim credit facility in order to pay the purchase price and transactional expenses of the viacell acquisition this unsecured interim credit facility matured on march 31 2008 at which point all amounts outstanding were due in full on march 28 2008 we paid in full the outstanding balance on the unsecured interim credit facility of 3000 million the source of funds for the repayment was comprised of our cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

6 senior unsecured notes on may 30 2008 we issued and sold sevenyear senior notes at a rate of 6 with a face value of 1500 million and received 1500 million in gross proceeds from the issuance the debt which matures in may 2015 is unsecured interest on the 6 senior notes is payable semiannually on may 30th and november 30th we may redeem some or all of our 6 senior notes at any time in an amount not less than 10 of the original aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest plus the applicable makewhole amount the financial covenants in our 6 senior notes include debttocapital ratios which if our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade would be replaced by a contingent maximum total leverage ratio at all times during fiscal year 2008 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants and anticipate being in compliance for the duration of the term of the notes 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 we entered into forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 3000 million and a weighted average interest rate of 425 these contracts were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance in may 2008 we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million upon the issuance of our 6 senior unsecured notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance with a notional amount totaling 1500 million was no longer probable as a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million and recognized derivative losses of 175 million in interest and other expense 

  

before amortization expense we had accumulated derivative losses of 84 million net of taxes of 54 million in other comprehensive loss income as of december 28 2008 and 53 million net of taxes of 35 million as of december 30 2007 related to these cash flow hedges the derivative losses are amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense during fiscal year 2008 12 million of these derivative losses were amortized into interest expense 

  

once established cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other comprehensive loss income until maturity unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into interest expense on the consolidated financial statements we did not recognize any ineffectiveness during fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2007 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

receivables securitization facility during fiscal year 2001 we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution under this arrangement we sold on a revolving basis certain of our accounts receivable balances to the consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third party financial institution as collections reduce the balance of sold accounts receivable new receivables are sold our consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables accordingly the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on our balance sheets the amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third party financial institution may not exceed 650 million under the terms of this arrangement our consolidated subsidiary retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances the aggregate amount of receivables sold to the consolidated subsidiary was 728 million as of december 28 2008 and 790 million as of december 30 2007 at december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 an undivided interest of 400 million and 450 million respectively in the receivables had been sold to the third party financial institution under this arrangement the remaining interest in receivables of 328 million and 340 million that were sold to and held by the consolidated subsidiary were included in accounts receivable in the consolidated financial statements at december 28 2008 and december 30 2007 respectively 

  

the agreement requires the third party financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the receivable is sold to its maturity date at december 28 2008 the effective interest rate was libor plus approximately 220 basis points the servicing fees received constitute adequate compensation for services 

  

performed no servicing asset or liability is therefore recorded the agreement also includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of bb or above as defined by standard  poor’s rating services and ba2 or above as defined by moody’s investors service at december 28 2008 we had a senior unsecured credit rating of bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s rating services and of baa3 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service in january 2009 our consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts receivable securitization facility to february 27 2009 in order to conclude the audit of the receivables purchase agreement we anticipate an additional extension of the facility 

  

dividends 

  

our board declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2008 and 2007 resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per share 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 28 2008 for continuing and discontinuing operations 

  

  

     

capital expenditures 

  

during fiscal year 2009 we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2008 primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

  

on november 6 2006 we announced that our board authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock under a stock repurchase program the “repurchase program” the repurchase program would expire on october 25 2010 unless this authorization was terminated earlier by our board and could be 

  

suspended or discontinued at any time during the first quarter of 2007 we repurchased in the open market 2500000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 600 million including commissions under the repurchase program during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 we repurchased in the open market 3468300 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 871 million including commissions under the repurchase program during the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 we repurchased in the open market 1082492 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 289 million including commissions under the repurchase program during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 we repurchased in the open market 1000000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 269 million including commissions under the repurchase program during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 we repurchased 1949208 shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 566 million including commissions under the repurchase program these repurchases completed our repurchase of the 100 million shares in the aggregate authorized under the repurchase program the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value 

  

on october 23 2008 we announced that our board has authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million additional shares of our common stock under a new stock repurchase program the “new repurchase program” the new repurchase program will expire on october 22 2012 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 we repurchased 1000000 shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 180 million including commissions under the new repurchase program from december 29 2008 through february 20 2009 we repurchased approximately 1000000 shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of 142 million including commissions under the new repurchase program 

  

our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of our common stock in the aggregate to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we repurchased 17549 shares of our common stock during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 we repurchased 3354 shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 we repurchased 16618 shares of our common stock the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value 

  

at december 28 2008 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1791 million and an amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility with 2770 million available for additional borrowing in may 2008 we finalized an issuance of 6 sevenyear senior unsecured notes with proceeds of approximately 1500 million the proceeds from this debt issuance were used to repay existing borrowings under our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

in connection with the settlement of an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred within our life and analytical sciences facility in boston massachusetts in march 2005 we accrued 97 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building including environmental matters that was damaged in the fire we paid 16 million during fiscal year 2008 and 39 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building and we anticipate that the remaining payments of 42 million will be completed by the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 

  

our businesses have not been materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general however recent distress in these markets has adversely impacted a number of financial conditions by severely diminishing liquidity and credit availability creating extreme volatility in security prices increasing interest rates andor widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments the increasing or high interest rates andor widening credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold increases in interest rates or credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

  

our pension plans have not experienced any material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets however as a result of losses experienced in global equity markets our pension funds had a negative return for fiscal year 2008 which in turn created increased pension costs in fiscal year 2009 and potentially in additional future periods in addition we may be required to fund our pension plans for approximately 180 million by fiscal year 2010 and we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods we cannot predict how long these conditions will exist or how our businesses may be affected in difficult global financial markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 

  

effects of recently adopted accounting pronouncement 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” which clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions and expands the related disclosure requirements under the standard fair value measurements are to be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy sfas no 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements sfas no 157 defines fair value based upon an exit price model the fasb also issued fasb staff position “fsp” no 1572 in february 2008 “fsp no 1572” fsp no 1572 delays the effective date of the application of sfas no 157 to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis we adopted sfas no 157 as of december 31 2007 with the exception of the application of the statement to nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional details

presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” with the issuance of this statement the fasb concluded that the us gaap hierarchy should be directed toward the entity and not its auditor and reside in the accounting literature established by the fasb as opposed to the american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” statement on auditing standards no 69 “the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles” sfas no 162 is effective 60 days following the securities and exchange commission’s “sec” approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section 411 “the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles” we have evaluated the requirements of sfas no 162 and have determined that it will not have a significant impact on our determination or reporting of financial results

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them when arrangements include multiple elements we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element all in accordance with eitf issue no 0021 “ revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings 

  

inventory valuation we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase andor manufacture we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

  

business combinations the allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocation purposes the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets 

  

value of longlived assets including intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized  in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the 

  

same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization through fiscal year 2008 we assessed the annual impairment testing using the life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics reporting units we completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of december 28 2008 and january 1 2008 and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 

  

employee compensation and benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations we incurred expenses of 83 million in fiscal year 2008 125 million in fiscal year 2007 and 102 million in fiscal year 2006 for our retirement and postretirement plans we expect expenses of approximately 132 million in fiscal year 2009 for our retirement and postretirement plans pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year as of december 28 2008 we estimated the expected longterm rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was 85 and was 65 for all plans outside the united states we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates at the measurement date if any of our assumptions were to change our pension plan expenses would also change a onequarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by 05 million for fiscal year 2009 in the united states and by 04 million for fiscal year 2009 for all plans outside the united states a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pretax pension expense by 22 million for fiscal year 2009 in the united states and by 07 million for fiscal year 2009 for all plans outside the united states we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

  

restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals in accordance with sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and iii asset impairments as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statement of operations line entitled “restructuring and lease charges reversals net” 

  

gains or losses on dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this 

  

estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the fiscal year ended december 28 2008 we did not recognize any gains or losses from disposition of fixed assets we recorded 20 million in losses from the disposition of discontinued operations any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the “gains on disposition” or “discontinued operations” line items appearing in our consolidated statement of operations 

  

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

  

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits as required by fin no 48 adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is ultimately settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

  

additionally in accordance with sfas no 109 we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits other income tax credits and certain pension accruals valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable improvements or other changes in our operations domestically and internationally could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial instruments 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december 28 2008 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet credit risk and market risk are insignificant as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major 

  

banking institutions unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings principal hedged currencies include the british pound gbp canadian dollar cad euro eur japanese yen jpy and singapore dollar sgd we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us equivalent notional amounts totaling 1608 million at december 28 2008 and 1052 million as of december 30 2007 and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material the duration of these contracts entered into in fiscal year 2008 was generally 30 days 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 we entered into forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 3000 million and a weighted average interest rate of 425 these contracts were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance in may 2008 we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million upon the issuance of our 6 senior unsecured notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance with a notional amount totaling 1500 million was no longer probable as a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million and recognized derivative losses of 175 million in interest and other expense 

  

before amortization expense we had accumulated derivative losses of 84 million net of taxes of 54 million in other comprehensive loss income as of december 28 2008 and 53 million net of taxes of 35 million as of december 30 2007 related to these cash flow hedges the derivative losses are amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense during fiscal year 2008 12 million of these derivative losses were amortized into interest expense 

  

once established cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other comprehensive loss income until maturity unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into interest expense on the consolidated financial statements we did not recognize any ineffectiveness during fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2007 

  

we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 

  

market risk 

  

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 60 of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in a natural hedge 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days as of december 28 2008 this computation estimated that there is a 5 chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 01 million this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2008 the valueatrisk ranged between 03 million and 08 million with an average of approximately 05 million 

  

interest rate risk as described above our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 we entered into forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 3000 million and a weighted average interest rate of 425 these contracts were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance in may 2008 we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million upon the issuance of our 6 senior unsecured notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance with a notional amount totaling 1500 million was no longer probable as a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 1500 million and recognized derivative losses of 175 million in interest and other expense 

  

before amortization expense we had accumulated derivative losses of 84 million net of taxes of 54 million in other comprehensive loss income as of december 28 2008 and 53 million net of taxes of 35 million as of december 30 2007 related to these cash flow hedges the derivative losses are amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense during fiscal year 2008 12 million of these derivative losses were amortized into interest expense 

  

once established cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other comprehensive loss income until maturity unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into interest expense on the consolidated financial statements we did not recognize any ineffectiveness during fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2007 

  

interest rate risk—sensitivity  as of december 28 2008 our debt portfolio consisted of 3590 million of variable rate debt in addition our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 1791 million at december 28 2008 our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

i changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt consisting of 3590 million of revolving and interim debt facilities to fluctuate an increase of 10 or approximately 10 basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pretax charge to our earnings of 04 million for fiscal year 2009 

  

ii changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate as described above an increase of 10 or approximately 10 basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 04 million for fiscal year 2009 

  

iii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

   

   

   

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 28 2008 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework 

  

based on this assessment our management believes that as of december 28 2008 our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

our registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting this report appears below 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm

waltham massachusetts 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of perkinelmer inc and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 28 2008 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 28 2008 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 28 2008 of the company and our report dated february 26 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

recent developments 

  

as part of our strategy to grow our core businesses we have taken the following actions in 2007 

  

acquisitions 

  

newborn metabolic screening business from pediatrix medical group inc in december 2007 we entered into an agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of pediatrix screening inc which constitutes the newborn metabolic screening “nms” business of pediatrix medical group inc the nms business provides neonatal screening and consultative services to hospitals medical groups and various states this acquisition is intended to expand our capabilities to supply state laboratories and other agencies with comprehensive newborn screening solutions this transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2008 

  

viacell inc in november 2007 our wholly owned subsidiary completed a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of viacell inc “viacell” at a price of 725 per share viacell specializes in the collection testing processing and preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells through the tender offer our wholly owned subsidiary acquired more than 90 of the outstanding shares of common stock of viacell we acquired the remaining outstanding shares of viacell by means of a merger of our wholly owned subsidiary with and into viacell as a result of which viacell became our wholly owned subsidiary the addition of viacell’s viacord ® product offering for the preservation of umbilical cord blood and its sales and marketing organization is expected to facilitate the expansion of our neonatal and prenatal businesses aggregate consideration for this transaction was approximately 2958 million in cash which excludes 318 million in acquired cash the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill none of which is tax deductible 

  

following the viacell acquisition we committed to a preliminary plan of integration of certain viacell activities that included workforce reductions as of december 30 2007 we recorded 12 million of severance liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 953 “recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination” “eitf 953” we had not finalized the preliminary integration plan as of december 30 2007 but we expect to complete the plan no later than one year from the date of acquisition 

  

following the viacell acquisition our board of directors the “board” approved a plan to sell the viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses that were acquired with viacell the viacyte sm business focuses on the development of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized oocytes the cellular therapy technology business focuses on the development of therapeutic uses of unrestricted somatic stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood including the areas of cancer cardiac disease and diabetes we have determined that both businesses do not strategically fit with the other products offered by the life and analytical sciences segment we also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses we could not effectively compete in the marketplace with larger companies which focus on the market for such products we are actively marketing and are currently committed to a plan to sell both of these businesses we have classified the results of the viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 

  

remaining minority interest of perkinelmer india pvt ltd in june 2007 we acquired the remaining minority interest in perkinelmer india pvt ltd “pki india” a direct sales service and marketing operation targeting india’s life science and analytical instrumentation markets from labindia instruments pvt ltd the acquisition establishes pki india as our wholly owned subsidiary consideration for this transaction was approximately 13 million in cash plus potential additional consideration of approximately 07 million of which we paid 02 million during the fiscal year 2007 we expect to pay the remaining 05 million in quarterly installments through the first quarter of 2008 the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill none of which is tax deductible 

  

improvision ltd in march 2007 we acquired the stock of improvision ltd “improvision” a leading provider of cellular imaging software and integrated hardware solutions used in life sciences research we expect 

  

that the addition of improvision’s imaging and analysis software to our high content screening systems will provide customers with powerful imaging solutions for analyzing cellular events from realtime imaging of live cells to rapid high content screening of multiple samples consideration for this transaction was approximately 236 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration which we expect to be immaterial to us during 2007 we paid 06 million for net working capital adjustments the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill none of which is tax deductible 

  

euroscreen products sa in january 2007 we acquired the stock of euroscreen products sa “euroscreen” a developer of the aequoscreen™ cellular assay platform the aequoscreen™ platform from euroscreen is based on an innovative luminescence technology that generates higher quality data while reducing the number of false positives in g proteincoupled receptor “gpcr” screening applications consideration for this transaction was approximately 181 million in cash the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill none of which is tax deductible 

  

evotec technologies gmbh  in january 2007 we acquired the stock of evotec technologies gmbh “evotec” the acquisition is intended to allow us to provide our customers in the pharmaceutical biotechnology and academic arenas with evotec’s high content screening instruments and software these analysis tools determine the composition of cells and cell structure a critical step in moving potential drug targets quickly through the discovery process consideration for this transaction was approximately 330 million in cash which was paid in fiscal year 2006 during 2007 we received 12 million for net working capital adjustments the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill none of which is tax deductible

we took the following actions in 2007 to further focus our core businesses 

  

share repurchase program 

  

on november 6 2006 we announced that our board authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock under a stock repurchase program the “repurchase program” the repurchase program will expire on october 25 2010 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during fiscal 2007 we repurchased in the open market approximately 81 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 2030 million including commissions under the repurchase program the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value 

  

restructuring 

  

during fiscal 2007 we incurred 144 million in pretax restructuring and lease charges during the first and fourth quarters of 2007 our management approved separate plans for workforce reductions in several locations and partial closure of a facility the purpose of the restructuring plans approved in the first and fourth quarters of 2007 was principally to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy the pretax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect the impact of immediate and future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible as we have incurred and will incur offsetting costs

marketing 

  

all of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces as of december 30 2007 we employed approximately 2800 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35 countries and marketing products and services in more than 150 countries in addition in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials and supplies 

  

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with certain suppliers for certain critical raw materials and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials see further description in the applicable risk factor under “item 1a risk factors” 

  

intellectual property 

  

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide 

  

array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties we are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights see “item 3 legal proceedings” for a discussion of these matters 

  

backlog 

  

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

  

due to the wide range of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors this affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

in our life and analytical sciences segment we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market niches we expect the proportion of large competitors in this reporting segment to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

we do not believe any single competitor competes directly with our optoelectronics segment across its full product range however we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale of specialty flashtubes and ultra specialty lighting sources photo detectors and photodiodes and switched power supplies competition is based on price technological innovation operational efficiency and product reliability and quality 

  

we believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenditures were approximately 1131 million during fiscal 2007 approximately 997 million during fiscal 2006 and approximately 874 million during fiscal 2005 the fiscal year 2007 included an inprocess research and development “iprd” charge of 15 million related to the evotec and euroscreen acquisitions 

  

we directed our research and development efforts in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 primarily toward genetic screening biodiscovery and analytical sciences markets within our life and analytical sciences segment and medical imaging and photonics within our optoelectronics segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives we expect our research and development spending to increase on an absolute basis and in line with our growth in sales during fiscal 2008 and to continue to emphasize these same markets 

  

environmental matters 

  

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 42 million as of december 30 2007 which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

in addition we accrued 97 million during the second quarter of 2007 for a fire that occurred within our life and analytical sciences facility in boston massachusetts in march 2005 representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building including environmental matters we paid 39 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building we anticipate that the remaining payments of 58 million will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

  

as of december 30 2007 we employed approximately 8700 employees several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of december 30 2007 we employed an aggregate of approximately 1700 union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 

  

financial information about reporting segments 

  

the assets and expenses for our corporate headquarters such as legal tax accounting and finance human resources property and insurance management information technology treasury and other management and compliance costs have been included as “corporate” below we have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when such costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses these amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments 

  

the table below sets forth sales and operating income loss by reporting segment for the 2007 2006 and 2005 fiscal years 

  

   

discontinued operations have not been included in the preceding table 

  

additional information relating to our reporting segments for the 2007 2006 and 2005 fiscal years is as follows 

  

   

   

financial information about geographic areas 

  

both of our reporting segments conduct business in and derive substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during fiscal 2007 we had 11278 million in sales from our international operations representing approximately 63 of our total sales during fiscal 2007 we derived approximately 76 of our international sales from our life and analytical sciences segment and approximately 24 of our international sales from our optoelectronics segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future 

  

we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements geographic information is discussed in note 23 to our consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

  

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

  

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential sales revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

  

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 

  

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 

  

we have in the past and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as evotec technologies gmbh and euroscreen products sa acquired in january 2007 improvision ltd acquired in march 2007 the remaining minority interest of perkinelmer india pvt ltd acquired in june 2007 and viacell inc acquired in november 2007 however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems cultural differences or difficulties in predicting financial results as a result our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term 

  

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us we may also incur expenses in evaluating possible acquisitions that we ultimately do not acquire which expenses then may adversely impact our profitability 

  

if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

  

our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies laboratories academic and research institutions public health authorities private healthcare organizations doctors and government agencies our quarterly sales and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter in addition our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets however the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets general economic conditions or cuts in government funding would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services in addition government funding is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals such declines could harm our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock and could limit our ability to sustain profitability 

  

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

  

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however 

  

may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

  

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

  

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

  

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

  

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

  

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

  

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

  

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

disruptions in the supply of raw materials and supplies from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

  

the production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however certain critical raw materials and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply we generally have multiyear contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and in some cases validate new raw materials such raw materials and supplies usually could be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price decline in quality or delay in delivery but a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials or supplies is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations and could damage our relationships with customers 

  

if we are unable to produce an adequate quantity of products to meet our customers’ demands our revenue growth may be adversely affected 

  

we have an established global manufacturing base with facilities in multiple locations around the world each of these facilities faces risks to its production capacity that may relate to natural disasters labor relations or regulatory compliance in addition in any of these facilities we may not manage the manufacturing or production processes at expected levels we may fail to anticipate or act on the need to increase the production capacity or we may be unable to quickly resolve technical manufacturing issues that arise from time to time any of these risks could cause our revenue growth to be adversely affected 

  

the manufacture and sale of products may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury damage or loss we believe that our current liability insurance coverage is adequate for our present clinical and commercial activities however we may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage then our business could be adversely impacted 

  

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

  

some of the products produced by our life and analytical sciences segment are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration “fda” and similar international agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales resales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution other aspects of our operations are subject to regulation by different government agencies in the united states and other countries if we fail to comply with those regulations we could be subject to fines penalties criminal prosecution or other sanctions 

  

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

  

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

  

the healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations 

  

the healthcare industry including our genetic screening business is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and united states federal state and local laws and regulations in addition legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters the scope and effect of which we cannot predict if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal damages fines and penalties exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business as well as incur liabilities from thirdparty claims all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 

  

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability 

  

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total sales in the fiscal year ended december 30 2007 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

  

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

  

our success also depends on our ability to execute our leadership succession plan the inability to successfully transition these and other key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our activities 

  

our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured interim credit facility each contain and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured interim credit facility each include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 

  

our failure to comply with any of these restrictions in our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility may result in an event of default under that facility which could permit acceleration of the debt under that facility and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date 

  

  

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

  

as of december 30 2007 our total assets included 18 billion of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—at least on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible 

  

adverse changes in our business or the failure to grow our life and analytical sciences segment may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

not applicable 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

as of december 30 2007 our continuing operations occupied approximately 2575000 square feet in over 90 locations we own approximately 600000 square feet of this space and lease the balance we conduct our operations in manufacturing and assembly plants research laboratories administrative offices and other facilities located in 8 states and 35 foreign countries 

  

facilities outside of the united states account for approximately 1443000 square feet of our owned and leased property or approximately 56 of our total occupied space 

  

our real property leases are both shortterm and longterm we believe that our properties are wellmaintained and are adequate for our present requirements 

  

the following table indicates as of december 30 2007 the approximate square footage of real property owned and leased attributable to the continuing operations of both of our reporting segments 

  

   




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in papers dated october 23 2002 enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc collectively “enzo” filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york civil action no 028448 against amersham plc amersham biosciences perkinelmer inc perkinelmer life sciences inc sigmaaldrich corporation sigma chemical company inc molecular probes inc and orchid biosciences inc the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo infringed enzo’s patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against enzo by among other things engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo’s patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief in 2003 the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants we subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo’s patents are invalid in july 2006 the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and we believe excludes certain of our products from the coverage of enzo’s patents summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in january 2007 and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in july 2007 but a decision on those motions has not been rendered and a trial date has not been set 

  

on october 17 2003 amersham biosciences corp filed a complaint which was subsequently amended in the united states district court for new jersey civil action no 034901 seeking injunctive and monetary relief against one of our subsidiaries and alleging that our viewlux ™ and certain of our image flashplate ™ products infringe three of amersham’s patents related to highthroughput screening the “nj case” on august 18 2004 amersham plc filed a complaint against two of our united kingdombased subsidiaries in the patent court of the english high court of justice case no 04c02688 alleging that our same products infringe one corresponding amersham patent in the united kingdom which was granted in august 2004 the “uk case” on october 29 2003 we filed a complaint which was subsequently amended seeking injunctive and monetary relief against amersham in the united states district court for massachusetts civil action no 0312098 alleging that amersham’s in cell analyzer and leadseeker ™ multimodality imaging system and certain cyclic amp and ip3 assays infringe two of our patents related to highthroughput screening the “ma case” after a trial in the uk case in december 2005 the court ruled in february 2006 that amersham’s patent in question was invalid in the united kingdom and awarded costs to us amersham initiated an appeal of the ruling in the uk case but withdrew that appeal in january 2007 in may 2006 the court in the nj case issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in amersham’s patents that adopted many of amersham’s claim construction positions the parties entered into a settlement agreement in november 2007 to resolve all of the foregoing matters 

  

in 2002 pharmastem therapeutics inc “pharmastem” filed suit against viacell inc which is now our wholly owned subsidiary and several other defendants in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging infringement of united states patents no 5004681 and no 5192553 relating to certain aspects of the collection cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood “pharmastem i” after several years of proceedings at the district court level the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a decision in july 2007 that viacell did not infringe these two patents and that the two patents are invalid pharmastem filed a certiorari petition in january 2008 seeking to have the united states supreme court review the appellate court’s decision as to the invalidity of the patents but did not seek any further review of the noninfringement decision pharmastem had also filed a second complaint against viacell and other defendants in july 2004 in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts alleging infringement of united states patents no 6461645 and 6569427 which also relate to certain aspects of the collection cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood “pharmastem ii” we believe that the issues presented in pharmastem ii which was subsequently consolidated in the district of delaware with similar cases brought by pharmastem against other family cord blood banks are substantially the same as the issues presented in pharmastem i and that viacell does not infringe the patents at issue in the second case and that those patents are invalid for the same reasons as cited by the court of appeals in pharmastem i the delaware court granted viacell’s motion in october 2005 to stay the proceedings in pharmastem ii pending the outcome of pharmastem i and a decision from the united states patent and trademark office “us pto” on certain patent reexamination issues 

  

although the us pto had previously issued notice of its intent to allow the remaining claims of all of the patents the us pto subsequently decided to begin the process of reexamining each patent viacell has informed the delaware court overseeing pharmastem ii of the status of the reexaminations and that the federal circuit had ruled in its favor in the pharmastem i case the delaware court has yet to take any action in response to these notices 

  

we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above unresolved matters we are currently unable however to reasonably estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from the resolution of these matters or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at december 30 2007 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

2007 compared to 2006 sales for 2007 were 17873 million versus 15464 million for 2006 an increase of 2410 million or 16 changes in foreign exchange and acquisitions each contributed approximately 4 to the increase in revenue for 2007 as compared to 2006 the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment sales for 2007 as compared to 2006 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions the total increase in sales reflects a 1827 million or 16 increase in our life and analytical sciences segment sales due to increases in sales of instruments of 845 million service of 513 million and consumables and reagents of 469 million our optoelectronics segment sales grew 583 million or 15 primarily due to increases in our medical imaging products of 284 million specialty lighting products of 248 million and optical sensors of 48 million 

  

2006 compared to 2005 sales for 2006 were 15464 million versus 14738 million during 2005 an increase of 726 million or 5 changes in foreign exchange and acquisitions each contributed approximately 1 to the increase in revenue for 2006 as compared to 2005 the analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment sales for 2006 as compared to 2005 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions the total increase in sales includes a 635 million or 6 increase in our life and analytical sciences segment sales which grew from 10811 million in 2005 to 11446 million in 2006 primarily due to increases in service of 318 million instruments of 298 million and consumables and reagents of 19 million our optoelectronics segment sales grew 91 million or 2 from 3927 million in 2005 to 4018 million in 2006 primarily due to sales of our medical imaging products increasing by 151 million while sales within our optical sensors and specialty lighting product lines decreased 60 million 

  

cost of sales 

  

2007 compared to 2006 cost of sales for 2007 was 10626 million versus 9183 million for 2006 an increase of approximately 1443 million or 16 as a percentage of sales cost of sales increased to 595 in 2007 from 594 in 2006 resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 10 basis points to 405 in 2007 from 406 in 2006 amortization of intangible assets increased due to the acquisitions completed in 2007 and 2006 and was 344 million for 2007 as compared to 292 million for 2006 the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions completed in 2007 was approximately 25 million for 2007 stock option expense was 12 million and 13 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively the combined impact of net productivity and capacity improvements within both segments increased gross margin which was partially offset by pressures in our laboratory services business as a result of entering into several large new contracts requiring an increase in startup investment in the first six months of 2007 and a onetime charge related to flash module contracts in our optoelectronics segment 

  

2006 compared to 2005 cost of sales for 2006 was 9183 million versus 8593 million for 2005 an increase of 590 million or 7 as a percentage of sales cost of sales increased to 594 in 2006 from 583 in 2005 resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 110 basis points to 406 in 2006 from 417 in 2005 amortization of intangible assets was 292 million in 2006 as compared to 278 million in 2005 with the adoption of sfas no 123r cost of sales for 2006 also included stock option expense of 13 million no stock option expense was recorded in 2005 the remaining decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to unfavorable product and geography mix of sales pricing pressures and inflation including commodity costs during 2006 partially offset by efficiencies gained through increased production volume and successful execution of productivity initiatives 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

2007 compared to 2006 selling general and administrative expenses for 2007 were 4444 million as compared to 3768 million for 2006 an increase of approximately 676 million or 18 as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses were 249 in 2007 compared to 244 in 2006 amortization of intangible assets was 79 million for 2007 as compared to 30 million for 2006 stock option expense was 73 million and 72 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively this increase was primarily the result of increased headcount and employeerelated expenses to support our sales initiatives increased sales and marketing expenses to support recent acquisitions business development expenses amortization expense related to the acquisitions completed in 2007 and 2006 foreign exchange and stock option expense 

  

2006 compared to 2005 selling general and administrative expenses for 2006 were 3768 million versus 3655 million for 2005 an increase of 114 million or 3 as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased 40 basis points to 244 in 2006 from 248 in 2005 amortization of intangible assets was 30 million in 2006 as compared to 08 million in 2005 with the adoption of sfas no 123r selling general and administrative expenses for 2006 also included 72 million of stock option expense whereas no stock option expense was recorded in 2005 this decrease was the result of increased fixed cost leverage and cost controls offset in part by increased investment in business development activities stock option expense and an increase in the number of sales employees in emerging markets and higher growth product lines 

  

research and development expenses 

  

2007 compared to 2006 research and development expenses for 2007 were 1116 million versus 997 million for 2006 an increase of 119 million or 12 as a percentage of sales research and development expenses decreased to 62 in 2007 from 64 in 2006 amortization of intangible assets was 17 million for 2007 as compared to 16 million for 2006 research and development expenses also included stock option expense of 06 million and 07 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively we directed our research and development efforts similarly during 2007 and 2006 primarily toward genetic screening biodiscovery and analytical sciences markets within our life and analytical sciences segment and medical imaging and photonics within our optoelectronics segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives 

  

2006 compared to 2005 research and development expenses for 2006 were 997 million versus 874 million in 2005 an increase of 123 million or 14 as a percentage of sales research and development expenses increased to 64 in 2006 from 59 in 2005 amortization of intangible assets was 16 million in 2006 as compared to 01 million in 2005 with the adoption of sfas no 123r research and development expenses for 2006 also included 07 million of stock option expense whereas no stock option expense was recorded in 2005 we directed research and development efforts during 2006 and 2005 primarily toward genetic screening biodiscovery and analytical sciences markets within our life and analytical sciences segment and medical imaging within our optoelectronics segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives 

  

inprocess research and development charge 

  

2007 compared to 2006 inprocess research and development “iprd” charge for 2007 was 15 million which related to the acquisitions of evotec and euroscreen in determining the value of the inprocess projects we considered among other factors the inprocess projects’ stage of completion the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date the costs already incurred the projected costs to complete the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology we utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the iprd using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch this approach determines fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to an inprocess project over its useful life and then discounting these aftertax cash flows back to a present value we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value of each project at the acquisition date and the amount represents management’s best estimate of the amount a third party would pay for the projects 

  

2006 compared to 2005  we did not take an iprd charge in either 2006 or 2005 

  

gains on settlement of insurance claim 

  

2007 compared to 2006 during the second quarter of 2007 we settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred within our life and analytical sciences facility in boston massachusetts in march 2005 as a result of that settlement we recorded gains of 153 million during the second quarter of 2007 we received the final settlement payment of 215 million in june 2007 and had previously received during 2005 and 2006 a total of 350 million in advance payments towards costs incurred and for building inventory and equipment damages of the 565 million in total settlement proceeds received by us 256 million related to reimbursement of costs incurred 237 million related to damages to the building inventory and equipment and 72 million related to business interruption costs which were recorded as reductions to cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses 

  

during the second quarter of 2007 we accrued 97 million representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building including environmental matters we paid 39 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building and anticipate that the remaining payments of 58 million will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008 

  

restructuring and lease charges reversals net 

  

2007 compared to 2006 we have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions divestitures and the integration of our business units restructuring actions were recorded in accordance with sfas no 146 “ accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” “sfas no 146” restructuring and lease charges reversals net for 2007 were a 144 million charge versus a 36 million reversal for 2006 

  

the following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during 2007 2006 and 2005 

  

   

  

the purpose of the company restructuring plans approved in the first and fourth quarters of 2007 detailed below was principally to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy the pretax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations we expect the impact of immediate and future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible as we have incurred and will incur offsetting costs 

  

q4 2007 plan 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2007 our management approved a plan to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy the “q4 2007 plan” as a result of the q4 2007 plan we recognized a 48 million pretax restructuring charge in our life and analytical sciences segment related to a workforce reduction from these reorganization activities we also recognized a 48 million pretax restructuring charge in our optoelectronics segment related to a workforce reduction and the partial closure of a facility which was offset by the recognition of a 22 million deferred gain from the salesleaseback of that facility during the fiscal year 2001 

  

as part of our q4 2007 plan we reduced headcount by 90 employees all actions related to the q4 2007 plan were completed by december 30 2007 and we anticipate that the remaining payments of 43 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and the remaining payments of 43 million for the partial facility closure will be paid through fiscal year 2022 in accordance with the terms of the lease the lease payments will be offset by the recognition of the amortization of the deferred gain from the salesleaseback of that facility during the fiscal year 2001 

  

the following table summarizes the components of the q4 2007 plan activity recognized in 2007 by segment 

  

   

q1 2007 plan 

  

during the first quarter of 2007 our management approved a plan to shift resources into product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy as a result of this plan we recognized a pretax restructuring charge of 44 million during the first quarter of 2007 the “q1 2007 plan” the actions within the q1 2007 plan related to a workforce reduction resulting from reorganization activities within our life and analytical sciences segment 

  

as part of our q1 2007 plan we reduced headcount by 60 employees all actions related to the q1 2007 plan were completed by march 30 2007 and we anticipate that the remaining payments of 11 million will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 

  

viacell plan 

  

following the viacell acquisition we committed to a preliminary plan of integration of certain viacell activities that included workforce reductions as of december 30 2007 we recorded 12 million of severance liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 953 “recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination” “eitf 953” we had not finalized the preliminary integration plan as of december 30 2007 but we expect to complete the plan no later than one year from the date of acquisition as part of our viacell plan we reduced headcount by five employees and we anticipate that the payments of 12 million will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 

  

  

previous restructuring and integration plans 

  

the principal actions of these restructuring plans were workforce reductions related to the integration of our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses which is now our life and analytical sciences segment in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both the life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy during 2007 we paid 02 million related to the 2001 to 2006 restructuring and integration plans and recorded a pretax restructuring reversal of 06 million relating to these plans due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with both the life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics segments as of december 30 2007 we had approximately 20 million of remaining liabilities associated with these plans primarily relating to remaining lease obligations related to closed facilities in the life and analytical sciences segment the remaining terms of these leases vary in length and will be paid through fiscal year 2014 we anticipate that the remaining severance payments will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008 

  

lease charges

iprd charges represent incomplete acquired research and development projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use as of the acquisition date technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has completed all planning designing coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions features and technical performance requirements on the date of the acquisitions of evotec and euroscreen there were multiple iprd efforts underway at each company for certain current and future product lines in determining the value of inprocess projects we consider among other factors the inprocess projects’ stage of completion the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date the costs already incurred the projected costs to complete the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology for these acquisitions we utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the iprd using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch this approach determines fair value by estimating the aftertax cash flows attributable to an inprocess project over its useful life and then discounting these aftertax cash flows back to a present value for the acquisitions of evotec and euroscreen we estimated the value of the iprd to be 02 million and 13 million respectively we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of the acquisitions and the amount represents management’s best estimate of the amount a third party would pay in the aggregate for the projects the fair value of acquired inprocess research and development costs was expensed as of the acquisition date as the projects underway at evotec and euroscreen had not reached technological feasibility and were determined to have no alternative future use 

  

in connection with purchase price and related allocations we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed in connection with these acquisitions the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after consummation the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin thereon the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs in most acquisitions profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition the sum of the costs and operating income approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation as a result of purchase accounting we recognized the deferred revenue related to the viacell acquisition at fair value and did not recognize 181 million of deferred revenue that would have been otherwise recorded in future periods we would have recorded higher storage revenues in fiscal 2007 in the amount of 10 million as well as significantly higher amounts in future periods related to these contracts viacell customers have historically renewed these contracts although there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so in the future 

  

as of december 30 2007 the purchase price allocations for the agilix spectral ca macri ntd avalon the dma product line evotec euroscreen improvision and pki india acquisitions have been finalized as of december 30 2007 the purchase price and related allocations for the viacell acquisition were preliminary and may be revised as a result of adjustments made to the purchase price as well as additional information regarding liabilities assumed including contingent liabilities deferred taxes employee severance and facility closure costs and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the date of purchase we are not aware of any information that indicates the final purchase price allocation will differ materially from the preliminary estimates and we expect to complete any outstanding asset valuations no later than one year from the date of acquisition

we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above unresolved matters we are currently unable however to reasonably estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from the resolution of these matters or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

during 2005 the internal revenue service concluded its audit of federal income taxes for the years 1999 through 2002 there was a single open issue related to this audit which we favorably resolved during the fourth quarter of 2007 we are under regular examination by tax authorities in the united states and other countries such as china indonesia philippines and the united kingdom in which we have significant business operations the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating its unrecognized tax benefits as required by fin no 48 adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is ultimately settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at december 30 2007 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

receivables securitization facility during 2001 we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution under this arrangement we sold on a revolving basis certain of our accounts receivable balances to the consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third party financial institution as collections reduce the balance of sold accounts receivable new receivables are sold our consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables accordingly the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on our balance sheet the amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third party financial institution may not exceed 650 million under the terms of this arrangement our consolidated subsidiary retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances the amount of receivables sold to the consolidated subsidiary was 790 million as of december 30 2007 and 678 million as of december 31 2006 at each of december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 an undivided interest of 450 million in the receivables had been sold to the third party financial institution under this arrangement the remaining interest in receivables of 340 million and 228 million that were sold to and held by the consolidated subsidiary were included in accounts receivable in the consolidated financial statements at december 30 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively 

  

the agreement requires the third party financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the receivable is sold to its maturity date at december 30 2007 the effective interest rate was libor plus approximately 80 basis points the servicing fees received constitute adequate compensation for services performed no servicing asset or liability is therefore recorded the agreement also includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of bb or above as defined by standard  poor’s rating services and ba2 or above as defined by moody’s investors service at december 30 2007 we had a senior unsecured credit rating of bbb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s rating services and of baa3 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service in january 2008 our consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts receivable securitization facility to january 23 2009 

  

dividends 

  

our board declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2007 and 2006 resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per share 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 30 2007 

  

  

    

    

capital expenditures 

  

during 2008 we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in 2007 primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations to increase capacity in the amorphous silicon business and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

  

on november 6 2006 we announced that our board authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock under a stock repurchase program the “repurchase program” the repurchase program will expire on october 25 2010 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by our board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time during 2007 we repurchased in the open market approximately 81 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 2030 million including commissions under the repurchase program 

  

during 2006 we repurchased in the open market 89 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 1901 million including commissions these repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase program announced in november 2005 

  

the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

in connection with the settlement of an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred within our life and analytical sciences facility in boston massachusetts in march 2005 we accrued 97 million during the second quarter of 2007 representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building including environmental matters we paid 39 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building we anticipate that the remaining payments of 58 million will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008 

  

our businesses are not materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally however increasing or high interest rates andor widening credit spreads especially if such changes are rapid may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold for example beginning in the second half of 2007 difficulties in the mortgage and broader credit markets in the united states and elsewhere resulted in a relatively sudden and substantial decrease in the availability of credit and a corresponding increase in funding costs credit spreads widened significantly affecting volatility and liquidity in the debt and equity markets these conditions have persisted through the end of 2007 and we cannot predict how long these conditions will exist or how our businesses may be affected increases in interest rates or credit spreads as well as limitations on the availability of credit can affect our ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis which may adversely affect our 

  

liquidity and results of operations in difficult credit markets we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities this could cause us to curtail our business activities and could increase our cost of funding both of which could reduce our profitability 

  

effects of recently adopted accounting pronouncement 

  

in june 2006 the fasb issued fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin no 48 was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin no 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits classification on the balance sheet interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition we classify interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 

  

as a result of the adoption of fin no 48 on january 1 2007 we adjusted the carrying value of our uncertain tax positions and reduced our accrued liabilities by 36 million which was accounted for as an increase to retained earnings as of january 1 2007 as of the adoption date we had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of 485 million of which 360 million if recognized would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate the remaining amount if recognized would affect goodwill and discontinued operations however upon the adoption of sfas no 141r changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will effect income tax expense including those associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of sfas no 141r we had accrued interest net of tax benefits and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of 73 million which is not included in the unrecognized tax benefits of 485 million 

  

effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” sfas no 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions under the standard fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy we will be required to adopt sfas no 157 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 157 and have not yet determined the impact if any of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas no 159” sfas no 159 provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value with the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently we will be required to adopt sfas no 159 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we have evaluated the requirements of sfas no 159 and have determined the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements to be immaterial 

  

in march 2007 the fasb ratified eitf issue no 0610 “accounting for collateral assignment splitdollar life insurance agreements” “eitf no 0610” eitf no 0610 provides guidance for determining a liability for the postretirement benefit obligation as well as recognition and measurement of the associated asset on the basis of the terms of the collateral assignment agreement we will be required to adopt eitf no 0610 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we are currently evaluating the requirements of eitf no 0610 and have not yet determined the impact if any of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in june 2007 the fasb ratified eitf issue no 073 “accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities” “eitf no 073” eitf no 073 requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered 

  

for future research and development activities be deferred capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed we will be required to adopt eitf no 073 on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we are currently evaluating the requirements of eitf no 073 and have not yet determined the impact if any of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas no 141r” sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired sfas no 141r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination we will be required to adopt sfas no 141r in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 141r and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them when arrangements include multiple elements we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element all in accordance with eitf issue no 0021 “ revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by 1 applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and 2 specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings 

  

inventory valuation we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase andor manufacture we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

  

business combinations the allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocation purposes the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets 

  

value of longlived assets including intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review 1 on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and 2 on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the impairment test consists of a twostep process the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january 1 or the first day of each fiscal year this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered nonamortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized  in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization we completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of december 31 2007 and january 1 2007 and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 

  

employee compensation and benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations we incurred expenses of 125 million in 2007 102 million in 2006 and 119 million in 2005 for our retirement and postretirement plans we expect expenses of approximately 82 million in 2008 for our retirement and postretirement plans pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year as of december 30 2007 we estimated the expected longterm rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was 85 and was 76 for all plans outside the united states we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates at the measurement date if any of our assumptions were to change our pension plan expenses would also change a onequarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by 06 million for 2008 in the united states and by 05 million for 2008 for all plans outside the united states a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pretax pension expense by 24 million for 2008 in the united states and by 11 million for 2008 for all plans outside the united states we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal 2001 under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

  

restructuring activities our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals in accordance with sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of 1 severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades 2 costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and 3 asset impairments as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled “restructuring and lease charges reversals net” 

  

gains or losses on dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the year ended december 30 2007 we did not recognize any gains or losses from disposition of fixed assets we recorded 12 million in losses from the disposition of discontinued operations any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the “gains on disposition” or “discontinued operations” line items appearing in our income statement 

  

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

  

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits as required by fin no 48 adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position ii a tax position is ultimately settled with a tax authority andor iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

  

additionally in accordance with sfas no 109 we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits other income tax credits and certain pension accruals valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable improvements or other changes in our operations domestically and internationally could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial instruments 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december 30 2007 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet credit risk and market risk are insignificant as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings principal hedged currencies include the british pound gbp canadian dollar cad euro eur japanese yen jpy and singapore dollar sgd we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us equivalent notional amounts totaling 1052 million at december 30 2007 and 1748 million as of december 31 2006 and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material the duration of these contracts entered into in 2007 was generally 30 days 

  

in addition during the fourth quarter of 2007 we entered into forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling 3000 million a weighted average interest rate of 425 and a future dated settlement to coincide with our highly probable debt issuance in 2008 these contracts are intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our highly probable debt issuance in 2008 we had accumulated net derivative losses of 53 million net of taxes in other comprehensive income as of december 30 2007 related to these cash flow hedges the net derivative losses will be reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings no cash flow hedges were discontinued and no ineffectiveness was recognized during 2007 

  

we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 

  

market risk 

  

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 63 of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states resulting in a natural hedge 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days as of december 30 2007 this computation estimated that there is a 5 chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 01 million this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal 2007 the valueatrisk ranged between zero and 02 million with an average of approximately 01 million 

  

interest rate risk as described above our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

  

interest rate risk—sensitivity  as of december 30 2007 our debt portfolio consisted of 5160 million of variable rate debt in addition our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 2033 million at december 30 2007 our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

1 changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt consisting of 5160 million of revolving and interim debt facilities to fluctuate an increase of 10 or approximately 55 basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pretax charge to our earnings of 28 million for fiscal year 2008 

  

2 changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate as described above an increase of 10 or approximately 55 basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 28 million for fiscal year 2008 

  

3 changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest received to fluctuate

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

   

   

   

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 30 2007 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework 

  

based on this assessment our management believes that as of december 30 2007 our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

our registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting this report appears below 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of perkinelmer inc 

waltham massachusetts 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of perkinelmer inc and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 30 2007 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 30 2007 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 30 2007 of the company and our report dated february 28 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the company’s adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation “fin” no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin no 48” on january 1 2007

during the second quarter of 2006 our management approved a plan for workforce reductions in two locations in the united states as we shift resources into product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy we refer to this plan as our q2 2006 plan the actions within the q2 2006 plan related to workforce reductions resulting from reorganization activities within the life and analytical sciences segment we completed notifying affected employees on june 30 2006 as a result of this plan for workforce reductions we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 08 million during the second quarter of 2006 in addition during the fourth quarter of 2005 we had recognized a 22 million restructuring charge in the life and analytical sciences segment and a 60 million restructuring charge in the optoelectronics segment the “q4 2005 plan” the principal actions in the q4 2005 plan were workforce reductions and the closure of several facilities resulting from reorganization activities to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that were more consistent with our growth strategy 

  

during 2006 we recorded a pretax restructuring reversal net of 12 million relating to our q4 2005 plan due to the completion in june 2006 of the sale of a building previously reserved for as part of the q4 2005 plan partially offset by higher than expected severance costs the amount of the proceeds from the sale of the building in excess of the current book value of the building was recorded as a pretax restructuring reversal within our optoelectronics segment during 2006 we also recorded a pretax restructuring reversal of 06 million relating to our q2 2005 plan due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with both the life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics segments and a pretax restructuring reversal of 27 million relating to the q4 2002 plan due to the completion in december 2006 of the sale of a building previously reserved for in the q4 2002 plan the amount of the proceeds from this sale in excess of the current book value of the property was recorded as a pretax restructuring reversal within our life and analytical sciences segment 

  

during 2005 we recorded 221 million in restructuring and integration charges during the second and fourth quarters of 2005 our management approved separate plans to terminate employees in several locations as we shift into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy as a result of these plans of termination we incurred pretax restructuring charges of approximately 99 million also as part of our planned effort to consolidate our operations we closed one of our optoelectronics properties as a result we recorded an additional pretax restructuring charge during fiscal 2005 of approximately 61 million which consisted primarily of an impairment charge related to this facility in addition due to a soft sublease market we increased our reserves for our financial obligations under several leases associated with previous restructurings in 2001 and 2002 as a result we recorded an additional pretax restructuring charge during fiscal 2005 of approximately 61 million which is expected to be paid through 2014 

  

fluid sciences segment divestiture 

  

in september 2005 our board of directors approved a plan to divest our fluid sciences segment to increase our strategic focus on higher growth markets within our life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics segments the fluid sciences segment consisted of three businesses—aerospace fluid testing and semiconductor we have reflected this segment as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10k in november 2005 we sold the fluid testing business for approximately 345 million resulting in a net pretax gain of 303 million in december 2005 we sold the aerospace business for approximately 3330 million resulting in a net pretax gain of 2506 million in february 2006 we sold substantially all of the assets of our fluid sciences semiconductor business for approximately 265 million subject to a net working capital adjustment plus potential additional contingent consideration we recognized a pretax gain of 38 million exclusive of additional contingent consideration in 2006 we recognized these gains during fiscal 2006 and 2005 as gains on the disposition of discontinued operations we received total cash proceeds for these transactions of approximately 3900 million

marketing 

  

all of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces as of december 31 2006 we employed approximately 2700 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35 countries and marketing products and services in approximately 125 countries in addition in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials and supplies 

  

each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we generally have two to five year contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with certain of our suppliers for these raw materials for certain critical raw materials we have qualified only a single source we periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements in anticipation of future manufacturing needs with sufficient lead times we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials 

  

intellectual property 

  

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and 

  

maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties we are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights see “item 3 legal proceedings” for a discussion of these matters 

  

backlog 

  

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business units due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

  

because of the wide range of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors this affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations that produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

in our life and analytical sciences segment we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation product differentiation product availability quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market niches we expect the proportion of large competitors in this reporting segment to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

we do not believe any single competitor competes directly with our optoelectronics segment across its full product range however we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale of specialty flashtubes and ultra specialty lighting sources photo detectors and photodiodes and switched power supplies competition is based on price technological innovation operational efficiency and product reliability and quality 

  

we believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenditures were approximately 997 million during fiscal 2006 approximately 874 million during fiscal 2005 and approximately 824 million during fiscal 2004 

  

we directed our research and development efforts in 2006 2005 and 2004 primarily toward drug discovery genetic screening and environmental and chemical analysis tools within our life and analytical sciences segment and medical digital imaging xenon flash and cermax ® lighting within our optoelectronics segment 

  

environmental matters 

  

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the 

  

remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 35 million as of december 31 2006 representing our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2006 we employed approximately 8500 employees several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of december 31 2006 we employed an aggregate of approximately 1600 union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 

  

financial information about reporting segments 

  

the table below sets forth sales and operating profit loss by reporting segment for the 2006 2005 and 2004 fiscal years 

  

   

discontinued operations have not been included in the preceding table 

  

additional information relating to our reporting segments for the 2006 2005 and 2004 fiscal years is as follows 

  

   

   

financial information about geographic areas 

  

each of our reporting segments conducts business in and derives substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during fiscal 2006 we had 9560 million in sales from our international operations representing approximately 62 of our total sales during fiscal 2006 we derived approximately 78 of our international sales from our life and analytical sciences segment and approximately 22 of our international sales from our optoelectronics segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future 

  

we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements geographic information is discussed in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

  

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

  

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products we must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales we may also suffer a loss in market share and potential sales revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner 

  

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications for example some of our license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research and exclude clinical diagnostics applications 

  

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 

  

we have in the past and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems or cultural differences 

  

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us 

  

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

  

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

  

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

  

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

  

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

  

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

  

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

  

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new 

  

products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

  

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we are unable to produce an adequate quantity of products to meet our customers’ demands our revenue growth may be adversely affected 

  

we have an established global manufacturing base with facilities in multiple locations around the world each of these facilities faces risks to its production capacity that may relate to natural disasters labor relations or regulatory compliance in addition in any of these facilities we may not manage the manufacturing or production processes at expected levels we may fail to anticipate or act on the need to increase the production capacity or we may be unable to quickly resolve technical manufacturing issues that arise from time to time any of these risks could cause our revenue growth to be adversely affected 

  

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

  

some of the products produced by our life and analytical sciences segment are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration “fda” and similar international agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales resales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

  

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

  

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and 

  

market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

  

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales 

  

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total sales in the fiscal year ended december 31 2006 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

  

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

  

restrictions in our senior unsecured credit facility may limit our activities 

  

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility contains and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company our senior unsecured revolving credit facility includes restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 

  

our failure to comply with any of these restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility may result in an event of default under that facility which could permit acceleration of the debt under that facility and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date 

  

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

  

as of december 31 2006 our total assets included 15 billion of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible 

  

adverse changes in our business or the failure to grow our life and analytical sciences segment may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

not applicable 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

as of december 31 2006 our continuing operations occupied approximately 2453000 square feet we own approximately 717000 square feet of this space and lease the balance we conduct our other operations in manufacturing and assembly plants research laboratories administrative offices and other facilities located in 6 states and 35 foreign countries 

  

facilities outside of the united states account for approximately 1325000 square feet of our owned and leased property or approximately 54 of our total occupied space 

  

our real property leases are both shortterm and longterm we believe that our properties are wellmaintained and are adequate for our present requirements 

  

the following table indicates as of december 31 2006 the approximate square footage of real property owned and leased attributable to the continuing operations of each of our reporting segments 

  

   




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in papers dated october 23 2002 enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc collectively “enzo” filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york civil action no 028448 against amersham plc amersham biosciences perkinelmer inc perkinelmer life sciences inc sigmaaldrich corporation sigma chemical company inc molecular probes inc and orchid biosciences inc the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo infringed enzo’s patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against enzo by among other things engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo’s patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief in 2003 the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants we subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo’s patents are invalid in july 2006 the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and we believe excludes certain of our products from the coverage of enzo’s patents discovery is ongoing no trial date has been set but summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in january 2007 

  

on october 17 2003 amersham biosciences corp filed a complaint which was subsequently amended in the united states district court for new jersey civil action no 034901 against our subsidiary alleging that our viewlux ™ and certain of our image flashplate ™ products infringe three of amersham’s patents related to highthroughput screening the “nj case” on august 18 2004 amersham plc filed a complaint against two of our united kingdombased subsidiaries in the patent court of the english high court of justice case no 04c02688 alleging that our same products infringe one corresponding amersham patent in the united kingdom which was granted in august 2004 the “uk case” amersham seeks injunctive and monetary relief in both cases we filed answers and counterclaims in both cases on october 29 2003 we filed a complaint which was subsequently amended against amersham in the united states district court for massachusetts civil action no 0312098 alleging that amersham’s in cell analyzer and leadseeker ™ multimodality imaging system and certain cyclic amp and ip3 assays infringe two of our patents related to highthroughput screening the “ma case” we seek injunctive and monetary relief amersham subsequently filed an answer and counterclaims after a trial in the uk case in december 2005 the court ruled in february 2006 that amersham’s patent in question was invalid in the united kingdom and awarded costs to us amersham initiated an appeal of the ruling in the uk case but withdrew that appeal in january 2007 in may 2006 the court in the nj case issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in amersham’s patents that adopted many of amersham’s claim construction positions our motion asking the court to reconsider that decision was denied discovery has not yet been completed in either the nj or ma case nor has a trial date been set in either case a voluntary mediation occurred in september 2006 but did not result in a resolution of these matters fact discovery which was stayed pending the mediation has now resumed at the suggestion of the court in the nj case additional mediation is being scheduled 

  

we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above matters we are currently unable however to reasonably estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from the resolution of these matters or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at december 31 2006 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

provisionbenefit for income taxes 

  

2006 compared to 2005 the 2006 provision for income taxes from continuing operations was 324 million versus a provision of 01 million in 2005 the 2006 effective tax rate from continuing operations was 215 as compared to the 2005 effective tax rate of 02 the lower effective tax rate in 2005 was primarily due to i a benefit from the settlement of income tax audits for prior years in 2005 offset by the tax cost of the domestic reinvestment plan repatriation calculated in accordance with the homeland investment provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 and ii the use in 2005 of federal state and foreign tax attributes current year state and foreign net operating losses federal current year research and experimental credits and state current year income tax credits enabled by the sale of our fluid sciences segment 

  

our effective tax rate excluding onetime discrete items for 2006 was 237 compared to 235 for 2005 the slight difference in the rates was due to differences in the geographical distribution of income in 2006 versus 2005 

  

in december 2006 the tax relief and health care act of 2006 the “tax act” was enacted the tax act retroactively restored the expired research and experimental tax credit provisions of the law from january 1 2006 and extended the credit through december 31 2007 as a result of the tax act we recorded a benefit for the research and experimental tax credit in 2006 in the amount of 16 million 

  

2005 compared to 2004 the 2005 provision for income taxes from continuing operations was 01 million versus a provision of 235 million in 2004 the 2005 effective tax rate from continuing operations was 02 as compared to the 2004 effective tax rate of 236 the reduction in the effective tax rate between the years was due to i an incremental 170 million benefit associated with the conclusion of audits with the internal revenue service and revenue canada with respect to the years 1999 through 2002 and ii the use in 2005 of federal state and foreign tax attributes current year state and foreign net operating losses federal current year research and experimental credits and state current year income tax credits enabled by the sale of our fluid sciences segment these benefits were partially offset by an incremental accrual of 68 million for the tax cost of the domestic reinvestment plan repatriation calculated in accordance with the homeland investment provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 

  

discontinued operations 

  

as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have discontinued certain businesses and accounted for them as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” accordingly the results of operations and related cash flows have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 we recorded the following gains and losses which we report as the gain loss on dispositions of discontinued operations during the three years ended december 31 2006

in september 2004 our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our computertoplate business in june 2004 our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our electroformed products business and sell our ultraviolet lighting business the results of these businesses were previously reported as part of the optoelectronics reporting segment the abandonment of the computertoplate business resulted in a 10 million writedown of certain fixed assets and inventory for the year ended january 2 2005 the net assets of the electroformed products business were written off resulting in a 16 million pretax loss in 2004 the fixed assets and inventory of the ultraviolet lighting business were sold in july 2004 for their approximate book value 

  

during 2006 2005 and 2004 we settled various claims under certain longterm contracts and transition services with our technical services business which we sold in august 1999 the net settlement and the reversal of certain previously established contingencies resulted in pretax gains of 12 million in 2006 09 million in 2005 and 15 million in 2004

contingencies including tax matters 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party “prp” for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 35 million as of december 31 2006 representing our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a prp our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 

  

in papers dated october 23 2002 enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc collectively “enzo” filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york civil action no 028448 against amersham plc amersham biosciences perkinelmer inc perkinelmer life sciences inc sigmaaldrich corporation sigma chemical company inc molecular probes inc and orchid biosciences inc the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo infringed enzo’s patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against enzo by among other things engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo’s patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief in 2003 the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants we subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo’s patents are invalid in july 2006 the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and we believe excludes certain of our products from the coverage of enzo’s patents discovery is ongoing no trial date has been set but summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in january 2007 

  

on october 17 2003 amersham biosciences corp filed a complaint which was subsequently amended in the united states district court for new jersey civil action no 034901 against our subsidiary alleging that our viewlux ™ and certain of its image flashplate ™ products infringe three of amersham’s patents related to highthroughput screening the “nj case” on august 18 2004 amersham plc filed a complaint against two of our united kingdombased subsidiaries in the patent court of the english high court of justice case no 04c02688 alleging that our same products infringe one corresponding amersham patent in the united kingdom which was granted in august 2004 the “uk case” amersham seeks injunctive and monetary relief in both cases we filed answers and counterclaims in both cases on october 29 2003 we filed a complaint which was subsequently amended against amersham in the united states district court for massachusetts civil 

  

action no 0312098 alleging that amersham’s in cell analyzer and leadseeker ™ multimodality imaging system and certain cyclic amp and ip3 assays infringe two of our patents related to highthroughput screening the “ma case” we seek injunctive and monetary relief amersham subsequently filed an answer and counterclaims after a trial in the uk case in december 2005 the court ruled in february 2006 that amersham’s patent in question was invalid in the united kingdom and awarded costs to us amersham initiated an appeal of the ruling in the uk case but withdrew that appeal in january 2007 in may 2006 the court in the nj case issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in amersham’s patents that adopted many of amersham’s claim construction positions our motion asking the court to reconsider that decision was denied discovery has not yet been completed in either the nj or ma case nor has a trial date been set in either case a voluntary mediation occurred in september 2006 but did not result in a resolution of these matters fact discovery which was stayed pending the mediation has now resumed at the suggestion of the court in the nj case additional mediation is being scheduled 

  

we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above matters we are currently unable however to reasonably estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from the resolution of these matters or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

during 2005 the internal revenue service concluded its audit of federal income taxes for the years 1999 through 2002 we have agreed to the conclusions of the internal revenue service in all matters with the exception of one and have filed a single issue protest with the appeals division of the internal revenue service we expect to resolve the matter in the first half of 2007 regardless of the outcome of the protest we do not expect the final resolution to significantly impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we are under regular examination by tax authorities in the united states and other countries such as germany and the united kingdom in which we have significant business operations the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years’ examinations we have established income tax reserves which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments once established reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes available and when an event occurs requiring a change to the reserves the resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable in the opinion of our management based on our review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at december 31 2006 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements

of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on our balance sheet the amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third party financial institution may not exceed 650 million under the terms of this arrangement our consolidated subsidiary retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances the amount of receivables sold to the consolidated subsidiary was 678 million as of december 31 2006 and 910 million as of january 1 2006 at each of december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 an undivided interest of 450 million in the receivables had been sold to the third party financial institution under this arrangement the remaining interest in receivables of 228 million and 460 million that were sold to and held by the consolidated subsidiary were included in accounts receivable in the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2006 and january 1 2006 respectively

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2006 

  

   

because the credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates the above table does not contemplate interest obligations 

  

capital expenditures 

  

during 2007 we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately 400 million to 450 million primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations to increase capacity in the amorphous silicon business and to develop information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

  

during 2006 we repurchased in the open market 89 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 1901 million including commissions these repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase program announced in november 2005 the “program” the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value on november 6 2006 we announced that our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million additional shares of our common stock under a new stock repurchase program the “new program” the new program will expire on october 25 2010 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by our board the new program may also be suspended or discontinued at any time from january 1 2007 through february 23 2007 we repurchased 24 million shares of our common stock in the open market under the new program at an aggregate cost of 570 million including commissions any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs if we continue to repurchase shares the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility at december 31 2006 we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1911 million 

  

during 2005 and 2006 we have received advance payments toward business interruption and building damage from an insurance claim for a chemical fire that occurred within our life and analytical sciences facility in boston massachusetts in early 2005 the incident occurred during nonbusiness hours and no employee casualties or injuries were reported we expect that we will reach final settlement with the insurer in 2007 and believe we have sufficient insurance so that any gain or loss incurred by us in connection with this fire and environmental cleanup should not have a material effect on our results of operations 

  

effects of recently adopted accounting pronouncement 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r which requires compensation costs related to stockbased transactions including employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value sfas no 123r revises sfas no 123 as amended “accounting for stockbased compensation” “sfas no 123” and supersedes accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees ” we adopted sfas no 123r on january 2 2006 and prior to adoption we applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in apb opinion no 25 as permitted by sfas no 123 in accounting for employee stockbased compensation we generally did not recognize compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options because the options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 

  

in transitioning from apb opinion no 25 to sfas no 123r we have applied the modified prospective method accordingly periods prior to adoption have not been restated and are not directly comparable to periods after adoption under the modified prospective method compensation cost recognized in periods after adoption includes i compensation cost for all stockbased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 2 2006 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 less estimated forfeitures and ii compensation cost for all stockbased payments granted subsequent to january 1 2006 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123r less estimated forfeitures 

  

the total pretax stockbased compensation expense for the cost of stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and performance units was 175 million in 2006 the total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stockbased compensation was 61 million in 2006 respectively at december 31 2006 total unrecognized stockbased compensation expense expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 16 fiscal years amounted to 106 million total unrecognized stockbased compensation expense will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures if any 

  

prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we presented all excess tax benefits related to stock compensation as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows sfas no 123r requires the cash flows resulting from these tax benefits to be classified as cash flows from financing activities in 2006 the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options was 22 million which was classified as cash flows from financing activities as compared to 53 million in 2005 which was classified as cash flows from operating activities 

  

prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r unearned compensation was recorded in a contraequity account and established at the date restricted stock was granted representing the amount of unrecognized restricted stock expense that would be reduced as expense is recognized under the provisions of sfas no 123r the recognition of unearned compensation at the date restricted stock is granted is no longer required therefore in the first quarter of 2006 the 64 million of unrecognized restricted stock that had been recorded in “unearned compensation” in the consolidated balance sheet as of january 1 2006 was reclassified to “capital in excess of par value” 

  

in september 2006 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” “sab 108” sab 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year’s financial statements are materially misstated we were required to adopt sab 108 in 2006 the adoption of sab 108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 which requires companies to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally sfas no 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at their yearend balance sheet date sfas no 158 requires prospective application and was effective for us as of the end of fiscal year 2006 

  

the impact of adopting sfas no 158 was a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income of 327 million a reduction to other assets of 266 million an increase to current liabilities of 73 million an increase to current assets of 07 million and a reduction to longterm liabilities of 04 million with no impact to our consolidated statements of operations or statements of cash flows there was also no impact from the adoption of sfas no 158 on our compliance with the financial covenants contained in our loan agreement described in more detail in note 16 of our consolidated financial statements 

  

effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin no 48” fin no 48 was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the new interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we are required to adopt fin no 48 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 we are currently evaluating the requirements of fin no 48 and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” sfas no 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions under the standard fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy we will be required to adopt sfas no 157 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 157 and have not yet determined the impact if any of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas no 159” sfas no 159 provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value with the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently we will be required to adopt sfas no 159 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 159 and have not yet determined the impact if any of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them when arrangements include multiple elements we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element all in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 0021 “ revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables”  because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

warranty costs  we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by 1 applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and 2 specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings 

  

inventory valuation we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase andor manufacture we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on 

  

hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

  

business combinations the allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocation purposes in connection with the fair valuing of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed we are assisted by valuation consultants and assessments of intangible assets using customary valuation procedures and techniques are performed if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finitelived intangible assets 

  

value of longlived assets including intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review 1 on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and 2 on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings we completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill for 2006 and 2005 and concluded that there were no impairments while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 

  

employee compensation and benefits retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations we incurred expenses of 102 million in 2006 119 million in 2005 and 91 million in 2004 for our retirement and postretirement plans we expect expenses of approximately 120 million in 2007 for our retirement and postretirement plans pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year as of december 31 2006 we estimated the expected longterm rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was 85 and was 76 for plans outside the united states we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates at the measurement date if any of our 

  

assumptions were to change our pension plan expenses would also change a onequarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by 04 million for 2007 in the united states and by 01 million for 2007 for all plans outside the united states a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pretax pension expense by 21 million for 2007 in the united states and by 10 million for 2007 for all plans outside the united states we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

  

restructuring activities our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals in accordance with sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” our pretax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of 1 severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades 2 costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and 3 asset impairments as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled “restructuring and integration reversals charges net” 

  

gains or losses on dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the year ended december 31 2006 we recognized 15 million in gains from disposition of fixed assets we also recorded 24 million in gains from the disposition of discontinued operations which consisted of gains from the final disposition of our aerospace fluid testing telecommunications components and technical services businesses offset by losses associated with the disposition of our fiber optics test equipment and lithography businesses any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the “gains on disposition” or “discontinued operations” line items appearing in our income statement 

  

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

  

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world where appropriate we reserve for tax matters when we believe that the likelihood of an incremental liability being incurred is probable in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 5 “ accounting for contingencies” 

  

and sfas no 109 “ accounting for income taxes” “sfas no 109” any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

  

additionally in accordance with sfas no 109 we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits other income tax credits and certain pension accruals valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable improvements or other changes in our operations domestically and internationally could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

  

financial instruments 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december 31 2006 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet credit risk is insignificant as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs for the year ended december 31 2006 we did not engage in any designated cash flow hedges principal hedged currencies include the british pound gbp canadian dollar cad euro eur japanese yen jpy and singapore dollar sgd we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us equivalent notional amounts totaling 1748 million at december 31 2006 and 1976 million as of january 1 2006 the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material and the duration of these contracts was generally 30 days for 2006 we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 

  

market risk 

  

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us as approximately 62 of our business is conducted outside of the united states generally in foreign currencies our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures moreover we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the us resulting in a natural hedge 

  

although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days as of december 31 2006 this computation estimated that there is a 5 chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 01 million this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal 2006 the valueatrisk was 01 million with an average of approximately 01 million 

  

interest rate risk as described above our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings 

  

interest rate risk—sensitivity  as of december 31 2006 our debt portfolio consisted of 1518 million of variable rate debt in addition our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 1911 million at december 31 2006 our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

1 changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt consisting of 1518 million of revolving debt facilities to fluctuate an increase of 10 or approximately 42 basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pretax charge to our earnings of 06 million for fiscal year 2007 

  

2 changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate as described above an increase of 10 or approximately 42 basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 06 million for fiscal year 2007 

  

3 changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest received to fluctuate

conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2006 the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2006 our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

   

   

   

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework 

  

based on this assessment our management believes that as of december 31 2006 our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

our independent auditors have issued an audit report on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting this report appears below 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of perkinelmer inc 

waltham massachusetts 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that perkinelmer inc and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year 

  

ended december 31 2006 of the company and our report dated march 1 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the company’s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” and sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r”

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2006 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

unsecured credit facility  in october 2005 we entered into a 350 million unsecured senior revolving credit facility with a term of five years the facility replaced our previous 100 million facility and will be used for general corporate purposes which may include fulfilling working capital needs refinancing existing indebtedness making capital expenditures repurchasing shares or consummating acquisitions and strategic alliances 

  

tender offer  in october 2005 we commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of our outstanding 8 7  8  senior subordinated notes due 2013 the “senior subordinated notes” on november 14 2005 as part of an initial settlement under the tender offer we repurchased 2699 million of the 270 million outstanding senior subordinated notes 

  

share repurchase program on october 21 2005 our board of directors reaffirmed our authority to repurchase up to 10000000 shares of our common stock which we publicly disclosed on november 14 2005 

  

the “program” this program will expire on october 21 2008 unless it is earlier terminated by our board of directors during the fourth quarter of 2005 we repurchased in the open market under this program 1096000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 244 million we believe that the share repurchase program benefits our shareholders by increasing earnings per share by reducing the number of shares outstanding and that we are likely to have adequate financial flexibility to fund additional share repurchases given current cash and debt levels 

  

acquisition of elcos ag  in february 2005 we acquired elcos ag a leading european designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode or led solutions for biomedical and industrial applications consideration for the transaction was approximately 154 million in cash at the time of closing 03 million of additional payments in 2005 and approximately 11 million due through fiscal 2007 also we estimate that under an earn out provision in the acquisition agreement we will make an additional cash payment of approximately 31 million in 2006 to reflect the performance of the business in 2005 with the potential for additional earn out payments being made in 2007 and 2008 based on the performance of the business in 2006 and 2007 respectively 

  

american jobs creation act  the homeland investment provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 enacted on october 22 2004 provided us with an opportunity during 2005 to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries at a substantially reduced tax cost and to increase the amount of cash available to fund our operations in the united states during 2005 we repatriated cash of approximately 535 million of which over 470 million qualified as domestic reinvestment plan repatriations under the homeland investment provisions of the american jobs creation act while such repatriation carried with it reduced tax costs it also required that we still recognize incremental tax obligations it has been a general policy in the past to not provide for taxes on earnings that we did not intend to repatriate accordingly any incremental tax would have a negative impact on our current tax rates in 2005 we recognized 155 million of tax expense for qualified repatriation during 2006 and 2007 we will continue to invest the qualified earnings in permitted uses pursuant to the domestic reinvestment plans approved by our board 

  

tax audit  we are under regular examination by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these examinations tax reserves have been established which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments once established we adjust these reserves as information becomes available and when an event occurs requiring a change to the reserves we do not expect the examination process and resolution of tax matters to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position although future adjustments or settlements could have a material impact on our income tax expense effective tax rate cash flow and consolidated statement of income for a particular future period as a result of concluding the federal state and foreign audits during 2005 we recognized a benefit of 275 million 

  

restructuring and integration charges  total restructuring and integration charges for 2005 were 221 million during the second and fourth quarters of 2005 our management approved separate plans to terminate employees in several locations as we shift into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy as a result of these plans of termination we incurred pretax restructuring charges of approximately 99 million substantially all of this pretax restructuring charge will result in cash expenditures that we expect will be paid within the next 12 months also as part of our planned effort to consolidate our canadian operations we closed one of our properties in the montreal area as a result we recorded an additional pretax restructuring charge during fiscal 2005 of approximately 61 million which consisted primarily of an impairment charge related to the facility in montreal in addition due to a soft sublease market we increased our reserves for our financial obligations under several leases associated with previous restructurings in 2001 and 2002 as a result we recorded an additional pretax restructuring charge during fiscal 2005 of approximately 61 million which is expected to be paid through 2014 

  

fluid sciences business segment divestiture  in september 2005 our board of directors approved a plan to divest our fluid sciences business segment to increase our strategic focus on higher growth markets within our 

  

life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics businesses the fluid sciences business segment consisted of three businesses—aerospace fluid testing and semiconductor we have reflected this segment as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10k in november 2005 we sold the fluid testing business to caleb brett usa inc for approximately 345 million resulting in a net pretax gain of 303 million in december 2005 we sold the aerospace business to eaton corporation for approximately 333 million resulting in a net pretax gain of 2506 million we recognized these gains during fiscal 2005 as gains on the disposition of discontinued operations we received total cash proceeds in these transactions of approximately 360 million on february 27 2006 we sold substantially all of the assets of our semiconductor business to an entity affiliated with tara capital inc for approximately 265 million subject to a net working capital adjustment plus additional contingent consideration that could bring the total proceeds received to more than 30 million we are currently in the process of computing the gain on the transaction and will record such amount in the first quarter of 2006 

  

lithography divestiture and fiber optics test equipment shutdown  in 2005 as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities our board of directors also approved separate plans to sell our lithography business and to shutdown our fiber optics test equipment businesses we have reflected these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10k upon the sale of the lithography business in december 2005 we received proceeds of 05 million and recognized a pretax loss of 33 million as loss on the disposition of discontinued operations the shutdown of the fiber optics test equipment business in june 2005 resulted in a 52 million loss related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value in august 2005 certain assets that were previously written down were subsequently sold resulting in a gain of 01 million we recognized the pretax net loss of 52 million as a loss on the disposition of discontinued operations 

  

other operations classified as discontinued included in this form 10k are the financial results of other operations that were discontinued or sold prior to fiscal 2005 these include our computertoplate and electroformed products businesses which were approved for shutdown by our board of directors in september 2004 and june 2004 respectively and our ultraviolet lighting business which was sold in june 2004 these also include our telecommunications component and entertainment lighting businesses which were approved for shutdown by our board of directors in june 2002 our security and detection systems business which was sold in june 2002 and our technical services business which was sold in august 1999 we have reflected these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10k

optoelectronics 

  

our optoelectronics business unit provides a broad range of digital imaging sensor and specialty lighting components used in biomedical consumer products and other specialty end markets for fiscal 2005 our optoelectronics business unit generated sales of 3927 million 

  

we are a leading supplier of amorphous silicon digital xray detectors a technology for diagnostic medical imaging and radiation therapy amorphous silicon digital xray detectors replace film and produce improved image resolution and diagnostic capability for use in radiography angiography cardiac and cancer treatment the amorphous silicon technology is important to medical imaging applications as well as to industrial nondestructive testing for defect recognition within automated manufacturing lines 

  

we have significant expertise in optical sensor technologies with products used in a variety of applications some of the applications in which our optical sensors are used include sample detection in life sciences instruments xray luggage screening safety and security applications such as smoke detectors hvac controls document handlingsorting smart weaponry and noncontact temperature measurements for applications such as ear thermometers and consumer appliances

marketing 

  

all of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces as of january 1 2006 we employed approximately 2500 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35 countries and marketing products and services in approximately 125 countries in addition in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials and supplies 

  

each of our businesses uses raw materials and supplies that are generally readily available in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we typically do not have longterm contracts with any of our suppliers in some cases we may rely on a single supplier for particular items although we generally believe that we could obtain these items from alternative suppliers if necessary 

  

intellectual property 

  

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear 

  

royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties we are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights see “item 3 legal proceedings” for a discussion of these matters 

  

backlog 

  

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business units due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

  

because of the wide range of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors this affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations that produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

in our life and analytical sciences reporting segment we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation product differentiation product availability and quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market niches we expect the proportion of large competitors in this reporting segment to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

we do not believe any single competitor competes directly with our optoelectronics reporting segment across its full product range however we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale of specialty flashtubes and ultraspecialty lighting sources photodetectors and photodiodes and switched power supplies competition is based on price technological innovation operational efficiency and product reliability and quality 

  

we believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenditures were approximately 874 million during fiscal 2005 approximately 824 million during fiscal 2004 and approximately 768 million during fiscal 2003 

  

we directed our research and development efforts in both 2005 and 2004 primarily toward genetic screening biopharmaceutical and environmental and chemical end markets within our life and analytical sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and cermax lighting within our optoelectronics reporting segment in 2003 we directed our research and development efforts toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our life and analytical sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and cermax lighting within our optoelectronics reporting segment 

  

environmental matters 

  

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party prp for specific waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period in which our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 37 million as of january 1 2006 representing management’s estimate of the total cost for the ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the potential recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we are named a prp management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that these accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site we review these liabilities and adjust them to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or that we expect to have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows while it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may have been incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different than the amounts recorded 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

  

as of january 1 2006 we employed approximately 8000 employees several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of january 1 2006 we employed an aggregate of approximately 1800 union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 

  

financial information about reporting segments 

  

the table below sets forth sales and operating profit loss by reporting segment for the 2005 2004 and 2003 fiscal years 

  

   

discontinued operations have not been included in the preceding table 

  

additional information relating to our reporting segments for the 2005 2004 and 2003 fiscal years is as follows 

  

   

   

financial information about geographic areas 

  

the following geographic area information for continuing operations includes sales based on location of external customer and net longlived assets based on physical location 

  

   

   

each of our reporting segments conducts business in and derives substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during fiscal 2005 we had 9039 million in sales from our international operations representing approximately 61 of our total sales during fiscal 2005 we derived approximately 77 of our international sales from our life and analytical sciences reporting segment and approximately 23 of our international sales from our optoelectronics reporting segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future 

  

we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

  

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets 

  

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving customer needs and industry standards many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies substantial intellectual property portfolios substantial experience in new product development regulatory expertise manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers our products could become technologically obsolete over time or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products therefore we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales 

  

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications for example some of our license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research and exclude clinical diagnostics applications 

  

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing business or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 

  

we have in the past and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our acquisition of elcos ag in february 2005 however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems or cultural differences 

  

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us 

  

we may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property 

  

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage although it is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents patent applications we file however may not result in issued patents or if they do the claims allowed in the patents that issue may be narrower that what is needed to protect fully our products processes and technologies similarly applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed for our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret such as trade secrets and knowhow we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property 

  

third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications or may claim that our products processes or technologies infringe their patents in addition third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks we may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or other countries 

  

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

  

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

  

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

  

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

  

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

  

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or to make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we are unable to produce an adequate quantity of products particularly of our digital xray detectors to meet our customers’ demands our revenue growth may be adversely affected 

  

we have an established global manufacturing base with facilities in multiple locations around the world each of these facilities faces risks to its production capacity that may relate to natural disasters labor relations or regulatory compliance in addition in any of these facilities particularly our optoelectronics amorphous silicon facility in santa clara california we may not manage the manufacturing or production processes at expected levels we may fail to anticipate or act on the need to increase the production capacity or we may be unable to quickly resolve technical manufacturing issues that arise from time to time any of these risks could cause our revenue growth to be adversely affected 

  

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

  

some of the products produced by our life and analytical sciences segment are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration “fda” and similar international agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales resales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products cease their manufacture and distribution and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

  

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

  

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

  

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales 

  

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented the majority of our total sales in the fiscal year ended january 1 2006 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 

  

our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel the competition for these employees is intense the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 

  

restrictions in our senior unsecured credit facility may limit our activities 

  

our senior unsecured credit facility contains and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company our new senior unsecured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior unsecured credit facility our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 

  

our failure to comply with any of these restrictions in our senior unsecured credit facility may result in an event of default under that facility which could permit acceleration of the debt under that facility and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date 

  

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

  

as of january 1 2006 our total assets included 14 billion of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization we test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “nonamortizing”—on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned all of our amortizing intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible 

  

adverse changes in our business or the failure to grow our life and analytical sciences business may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

not applicable 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

as of january 1 2006 our continuing operations occupied approximately 2434000 square feet we own approximately 717000 square feet of this space and lease the balance our headquarters occupies 53000 square feet of leased space in wellesley massachusetts we conduct our other operations in manufacturing and assembly plants research laboratories administrative offices and other facilities located in 6 states and 35 foreign countries 

  

facilities outside of the united states account for approximately 1322000 square feet of our owned and leased property or approximately 54 of our total occupied space 

  

our real property leases are both shortterm and longterm we believe that our properties are wellmaintained and are adequate for our present requirements 

  

the following table indicates as of january 1 2006 the approximate square footage of real property owned and leased attributable to the continuing operations of each of our reporting segments

2004 compared to 2003 cost of sales for 2004 was 8463 million versus 7811 million for 2003 an increase of 652 million or 8 as a percentage of sales cost of sales increased to 592 in 2004 from 581 in 2003 resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 110 basis points from 419 in 2003 to 408 in 2004 the decrease in gross margin was partially attributable to greater revenue contribution as a percentage of overall sales from optoelectronics versus life and analytical sciences 

  

research and development expenses 

  

2005 compared to 2004 research and development expenses for 2005 were 874 million versus 824 million in 2004 an increase of 50 million or 6 as a percentage of sales research and development expenses increased to 59 in 2005 from 58 in 2004 we directed research and development efforts during 2005 and 2004 primarily toward genetic screening biopharmaceutical and environmental and chemical end markets within our life and analytical sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and cermax lighting within our optoelectronics reporting segment we expect our research and development spending to increase on both an absolute and percentage of sales basis in 2006 and to continue to emphasize the health sciences end markets 

  

2004 compared to 2003 research and development expenses for 2004 were 824 million versus 768 million in 2003 an increase of 56 million or 7 as a percentage of sales research and development expenses increased to 58 in 2004 from 57 in 2003 we directed research and development efforts during 2004 and 2003 primarily toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our life and analytical sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and cermax lighting within our optoelectronics reporting segment

2005 compared to 2004 selling general and administrative expenses for 2005 were 3655 million versus 3623 million for 2004 an increase of 32 million or 1 as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased 60 basis points to 248 in 2005 from 254 in 2004 the decrease as a percentage of sales of 60 basis points in 2005 was primarily due to net productivity improvements and cost reductions in both our life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics reporting segments 

  

2004 compared to 2003 selling general and administrative expenses for 2004 were 3623 million versus 3650 million for 2003 a decrease of 27 million or 1 as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased 170 basis points to 254 in 2004 from 271 in 2003 the decrease as a percentage of sales of 170 basis points in 2004 was primarily due to net productivity improvements and cost reductions in our life and analytical sciences reporting segment

2005 compared to 2004 restructuring and integration charges for 2005 were 221 million versus zero for 2004 the following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

   

q4 2005 plan 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2005 we incurred an 82 million restructuring charge in life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics which we refer to as our “q4 2005 plan” the principal actions in the q4 2005 plan included planned workforce reductions resulting from our resource shift towards product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy as well the closure of manufacturing and administrative facilities in order to consolidate certain operations in our north american and european territories 

  

as part of our q4 2005 plan we reduced headcount by 44 we anticipate that all remaining q4 2005 plan actions will be completed by december 2006 

  

we recorded restructuring charges by segment for the q4 2005 plan as follows 

  

   

q2 2005 plan 

  

during the second quarter of 2005 we recognized an 82 million restructuring charge in life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics which we refer to as our “q2 2005 plan” the purpose of these restructuring actions was to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that were more consistent with our growth strategy the principal actions in the q2 2005 plan comprised headcount reductions resulting from reorganization activities during the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded a pretax restructuring reversal of 04 million relating to this plan due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with the life and analytical sciences segment 

  

as part of our q2 2005 plan we reduced headcount by 228 we anticipate that all remaining severance costs will be paid by the end of the second quarter in 2006 

  

the following table summarizes the q2 2005 restructuring charges recognized in 2005 by segment 

  

   

q2 2003 plan 

  

during 2003 we incurred a 23 million restructuring charge in life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics which we refer to as our “q2 2003 plan” the purpose of the restructuring was to further improve performance and take advantage of synergies between our former life sciences and analytical instruments businesses which we began integrating in the fourth quarter of 2002 the principal actions in this restructuring plan included lower headcount due to the continued integration of the life and analytical sciences business in a european manufacturing and customer care center as well as headcount reduction at one of the optoelectronics manufacturing facilities to reflect recent declining demand for several product lines we planned to reduce headcount by 120 we recorded restructuring charges by segment for 2003 as follows 

  

   

this restructuring charge was primarily recorded in the second quarter of 2003 however we recorded additional charges of 05 million and 01 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 as required by sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  as some employees who were notified of their employment termination in the second quarter were required to work for a period of time prior to receiving their severance in addition in the fourth quarter of 2003 we recorded a pretax restructuring reversal of 04 million due to 30 fewer employee terminations as a result of higher attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and accordingly lower severance costs 

  

q4 2002 plan 

  

in connection with our decision to combine our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 260 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 which we refer to as our “q4 2002 plan” the q4 2002 plan allowed us to combine many business functions worldwide with the intention to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses’ sales service and research and development organizations the principal actions in the q4 2002 plan included planned workforce reductions of 546 people closure of approximately 20 facilities and disposal of underutilized assets 

  

the q4 2002 plan resulted in the integration of our united states life and analytical sciences sales service and customer care centers the integration of european customer care and finance centers the merging of a former life sciences european manufacturing facility with a former analytical instruments european manufacturing facility and the merging of a portion of a former life sciences research and development facility in europe with a former analytical instruments facility in europe 

  

during 2003 we expended 129 million to execute these actions in addition we recorded a reversal of 55 million in the q4 2002 plan due to 182 fewer terminations as a result of higher than expected employee attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and lower severance costs for actual terminations 

  

during 2004 we expended an additional 33 million to execute these actions during 2005 we expended 15 million to execute these actions in addition we recorded a restructuring charge of 56 million in the q4 2002 plan due to higher than expected costs associated with the closure of facilities primarily in europe the remaining liability associated with the q4 2002 plan represents severance related to 2 employees and ongoing lease commitments we expect to settle the remaining severance liability by the end of the first quarter of 2006 our current estimate is that our lease commitments on unoccupied buildings extend until 2014 

  

q1 2002 plan 

  

during the first quarter of 2002 our management developed a plan to restructure several businesses and we recorded a restructuring charge of 92 million we refer to these activities as our “q1 2002 plan” the principal actions in the q1 2002 plan included planned workforce and overhead reductions resulting from reorganization activities including the closure of a manufacturing facility disposal of underutilized assets and general cost reductions total headcount was reduced by 276 

  

during 2003 we recorded a restructuring reversal of 10 million in the q1 2002 plan primarily due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with our optoelectronics segment 

  

q4 2001 plan 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2001 in connection with the integration of packard bioscience company and a restructuring of our sales offices in europe we recorded a restructuring charge of 92 million in our life and 

  

analytical sciences segment and incurred 16 million in charges in 2002 we refer to these activities as our “q4 2001 plan” the principal actions in the q4 2001 plan included the closing or consolidation of several leased sales and services offices in europe as well as costs associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in europe the closure of leased manufacturing facilities in the united states and the disposal of related assets 

  

in 2003 we recorded an additional pretax restructuring charge associated with the q4 2001 plan of 18 million this charge was primarily due to additional severance and severance related benefits of the previously identified employees associated with the closure of our european manufacturing facility in the life and analytical sciences segment 

  

in 2004 we expended 10 million to execute the actions associated with the q4 2001 plan we expect to pay the remaining balance in 2006 for previously identified employees associated with the closure of our european manufacturing facility in the life and analytical sciences segment 

  

integration 

  

in november 2001 we completed our acquisition of packard bioscience company the integration activities are complete with the exception of 06 million in remaining payments due on leased facilities exited in 2001 that will be paid through 2011 

  

the following table summarizes integration reserve activity during 2005 and 2004 related to the acquisition of packard bioscience company 

  

   

gains losses on dispositions 

  

2005 compared to 2004 dispositions resulted in a net gain of 15 million in 2005 versus a net loss of 04 million in 2004 gain on dispositions in 2005 included a 20 million gain from an insurance reimbursement due to fire damage in certain manufacturing facilities offset by a 05 million loss on disposal of fixed assets due to a facilities upgrade loss on dispositions in 2004 included a 07 million loss from the sale of a business and was partially offset by a 03 million gain from the sale of facilities 

  

2004 compared to 2003 dispositions resulted in a net loss of 04 million in 2004 versus a net gain of 25 million in 2003 gains on dispositions in 2003 included 22 million from sales of facilities and 05 million from post closing adjustments associated with the resolution of contingencies related to the sale of our instruments for research and applied sciences business which we refer to as iras 

  

interest and other expense net 

  

interest and other expense net consisted of the following 

  

   

2005 compared to 2004 interest and other expense net for 2005 was 743 million versus 383 million for 2004 an increase of 360 million or 94 the increase in interest and other expense net in 2005 as compared to 2004 was due primarily to the fees associated with the extinguishment of approximately 300 million of our senior subordinated notes which included premium fees of 363 million an 89 million accelerated amortization of term loan and senior subordinated notes issuance fees and 85 million in charges associated with terminating interest rate swaps the increase was partially offset by a corresponding decrease in interest expense on our senior subordinated notes that were purchases pursuant to our tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2005 as well as a lower average outstanding term loan balance which was approximately 120 million in addition we recognized a gain on sale of investments of 58 million associated with the liquidation of an investment we anticipate that interest expense will decrease in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the repayment of the senior subordinate notes in 2005 a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

2004 compared to 2003 interest and other expense net for 2004 was 383 million versus 535 million for 2003 a decrease of 152 million or 28 the decrease in interest and other expense net in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due primarily to a lower average outstanding term loan balance by about 100 million interest and other expense also declined as a result of lower interest rates applicable to our term loan which are attributable to an amendment of our credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2003 the remaining decrease in interest and other expense was the result of i swapping 100 million of our senior subordinated notes from fixed rate debt to a floating rate based on sixmonth usd libor in january 2004 resulting in a 22 million decrease in interest expense and ii 23 million of net interest expense not incurred in 2004 as it was related to our zero coupon convertible debentures which we redeemed in 2003 the decrease in interest and other expense was partially offset by our increased acceleration of debt issuance costs of 41 million resulting from partial prepayments of our term debt during 2004 versus 19 million in 2003 

  

provisionbenefit for income taxes 

  

2005 compared to 2004 the 2005 provision for income taxes from continuing operations was 01 million versus a provision of 235 million in 2004 the 2005 effective tax rate from continuing operations was 019 as compared to the 2004 effective tax rate of 236 the reduction in the effective tax rate between the years was due to i an incremental 17 million benefit associated with the conclusion of audits with the internal revenue service and revenue canada with respect to the years 1999 through 2002 and ii the use in 2005 of federal state and foreign tax attributes current year state and foreign net operating losses federal current year research and experimental credits and state current year income tax credits enabled by the sale of our fluid science’s business unit these benefits were partially offset by an incremental accrual of 68 million for the tax cost of the domestic reinvestment plan repatriation calculated in accordance with the homeland investment provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 

  

2004 compared to 2003 the 2004 provision for income taxes was 235 million versus a provision of 227 million in 2003 the 2004 effective tax rate was 236 as compared to the 2003 effective tax rate of 

  

309 the reduction to the effective tax rate was primarily due to a 104 million benefit associated with the resolution of an appeal of internal revenue service audit findings with respect to our 1997 and 1998 taxes additional benefits resulting from the conclusion of tax audits in canada and the uk reduction of our state tax expense and the use of existing foreign net operating losses these benefits were partially offset by an accrual of 87 million for the estimated us tax cost of repatriation calculated in accordance with the homeland investment provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 

  

discontinued operations 

  

we recorded the following gains and losses which we report as the gain loss on dispositions of discontinued operations during the years ended january 1 2006 and january 2 2005 

  

   

in september 2005 our board of directors approved a plan to divest our fluid sciences business segment to increase our strategic focus on our higher growth markets within the life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics businesses the fluid sciences business segment consisted of three businesses—aerospace fluid testing and semiconductor in november 2005 we sold the fluid testing business to caleb brett usa inc for approximately 345 million resulting in a net pretax gain of 303 million in december 2005 we sold the aerospace business to eaton corporation for approximately 333 million resulting in a net pretax gain of 2506 million we recognized these gains during fiscal 2005 we received total cash proceeds in these transactions of approximately 360 million on february 27 2006 we sold substantially all of the assets of our semiconductor business to an entity affiliated with tara capital inc for approximately 265 million subject to a net working capital adjustment and additional contingent consideration that could bring the total proceeds received to more than 30 million we are currently in the process of computing the gain on the transaction and will record such amount in the first quarter of 2006 

  

as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth markets in december 2005 our board of directors also approved a plan to sell our lithography business we received proceeds of 05 million upon the sale of the business and recognized a pretax loss of 33 million we previously had reported the results of this business as part of the optoelectronics reporting segment 

  

in june 2005 our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our fiber optics test equipment business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we previously had reported the results of this business as part of the optoelectronics reporting segment the shut down of this business resulted in a 52 million loss related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value in august 2005 certain assets that were previously written down were subsequently sold resulting in a gain of 01 million 

  

as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities in june 2004 our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our electroformed products business and sell our ultraviolet lighting 

  

business in september 2004 our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our computertoplate business we previously had reported the results of all three of these businesses as part of the optoelectronics reporting segment the net assets of the electroformed products business were written off resulting in a 16 million pretax loss for the year ended january 2 2005 we sold the fixed assets and inventory of the ultraviolet lighting business in july 2004 for their approximate book value the abandonment of the computertoplate business resulted in a 10 million writedown of fixed assets and inventory 

  

during 2005 and 2004 we settled various claims under certain longterm contracts and transition services with our technical services business which we sold in august 1999 the net settlement and the reversal of certain previously established contingencies resulted in pretax gains of 09 million in 2005 and 15 million in 2004 

  

summary operating results of the discontinued operations were as follows 

  

   

acquisitions 

  

in february 2005 we acquired elcos ag a leading european designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode or led solutions for biomedical and industrial applications consideration for the transaction was approximately 154 million in cash at the time of closing 03 million of additional payments in 2005 and approximately 11 million due through fiscal 2007 also we estimate that under an earn out provision in the acquisition agreement we will make an additional cash payment of approximately 31 million in 2006 to reflect the performance of the business in 2005 with the potential for additional earn out payments being made in 2007 and 2008 based on the performance of the business in 2006 and 2007 respectively 

  

contingencies including tax matters 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 37 million as of january 1 2006 representing our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations while it is possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred we do not expect the potential exposure to be materially different from the amounts we recorded 

  

in papers dated october 23 2002 enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc “enzo” filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york civil action no 028448 against amersham plc amersham biosciences perkinelmer inc perkinelmer life sciences inc sigmaaldrich corporation sigma chemical company inc molecular probes inc and orchid biosciences inc the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo infringed enzo’s patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against enzo by among other things engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo’s patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief on may 28 2003 the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants enzo served its new complaint on july 16 2003 and we subsequently filed an answer denying the substantive allegations and including a counterclaim alleging that several of enzo’s patents are invalid during the last half of 2005 fact discovery was largely completed and a markman hearing was conducted regarding the construction of the claims in enzo’s patents the court has not yet issued its decision regarding claim construction or set a date for trial 

  

on october 17 2003 amersham biosciences corp filed a complaint which was subsequently amended in the united states district court for new jersey civil action no 034901 against one of our subsidiaries alleging that our viewlux ™ and certain of our image flashplates ™ infringe three of amersham’s patents related to highthroughput screening the “nj case” on august 18 2004 amersham plc filed a complaint against two of our united kingdombased subsidiaries in the patent court of the english high court of justice case no 04c02688 alleging that the same products infringe amersham’s european united kingdom patent granted in august 2004 the “uk case” amersham seeks injunctive and monetary relief in both cases we subsequently filed answers in both cases denying the substantive allegations and including affirmative defenses and counterclaims on october 29 2003 we filed a complaint which was subsequently amended against amersham biosciences corp in the united states district court for massachusetts civil action no 0312098 alleging that amersham’s in cell analyzer leadseeker ™ multimodality imaging system and certain cyclic amp and ip3 assays infringe two of our patents related to highthroughput screening the “ma case” we seek injunctive and monetary relief amersham subsequently filed an answer denying the substantive allegations and including affirmative defenses and counterclaims trial in the uk case was completed in december 2005 in february 2006 the court ruled that amersham’s patent in question was invalid in the united kingdom and awarded costs to us in the nj case discovery regarding issues of liability which have been bifurcated from issues of damages has largely been completed and a markman hearing on claim construction is anticipated in early 2006 no trial date has been set in the ma case discovery is ongoing 

  

we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above matters we are currently unable however to reasonably estimate the amount of loss if any that may result from the resolution of these matters or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in 2005 we resolved certain claims including the securities litigation described in part i of this annual report on form 10k under item 3 legal proceedings the resolution of these claims did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

during 2005 the internal revenue service concluded its audit of federal income taxes for the years 1999 through 2002 we have agreed to all matters with the exception of one and have filed a single issue protest with the appeals division of the internal revenue service and expect to resolve the matter in 2006 regardless of the outcome of this matter we do not expect final resolution to significantly impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows in 2006 

  

we are under regular examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities in the united states and other countries such as germany the united kingdom and states in which we have significant business operations such as california and new york the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction with the most significant one being that undertaken by the german tax authority for the years 1999 through 2003 

  

during the year in addition to the irs audit described above we concluded audits concerning income tax matters affecting certain of our subsidiaries with texas illinois the united kingdom canada and belgium 

  

as a result of concluding the federal state and foreign audits during 2005 we recognized a benefit of 275 million 

  

we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years’ examinations tax reserves have been established which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments once established reserves are adjusted as information becomes available and when an event occurs requiring a change to the reserves the resolution of current tax audits is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition although adjustments related to the examination process or audit settlement could have a material impact on our income tax expense cash flow and consolidated statement of income for a particular future period 

  

we are also subject to various other claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities each of these matters is subject to uncertainties and it is possible that some of theses matters may be resolved unfavorably to us in the opinion of our management based on its review of the information available at this time the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at january 1 2006 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january 1 2006 

  

   

because the credit facility borrowings are considered to carry variable interest rates the above table does not contemplate interest obligations 

  

capital expenditures 

  

during 2006 we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately 35 million to 45 million primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations to relocate certain administrative facilities and to capitalize expenses related to internally developed information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

other potential liquidity considerations 

  

in february 2005 we acquired elcos ag a leading european designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode or led solutions for biomedical and industrial applications the transaction combines elcos’ visible led technology platform and strong customer and application base with our global sales application and support organization therefore expanding the sales growth opportunities for the elcos technology we paid 

  

approximately 154 million in cash at the time of closing 03 million in additional payments in 2005 and are required to make future cash payments of approximately 11 million through fiscal 2007 also we estimate that under an earn out provision in the acquisition agreement we will make an additional cash payment of approximately 31 million in 2006 to reflect the performance of the business in 2005 with the potential for additional earn out payments being made in 2007 and 2008 based on the performance of the business in 2006 and 2007 respectively 

  

on october 21 2005 our board of directors reaffirmed our authority to repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock which we publicly disclosed on november 14 2005 the “program” this program will expire on october 21 2008 unless it is earlier terminated by our board of directors during the fourth quarter of 2005 we repurchased 11 million shares of our common stock in the open market under the program at an aggregate cost of 244 million subsequent to year end we repurchased 50 million shares of our common stock in the open market under the program at an average cost of 2325 per share 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas 123r” sfas 123r supersedes accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” this statement addressed the accounting for sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options under the new standard companies will no longer be able to account for sharebased compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb opinion no 25 instead companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fairvalue method and recognize the related expense associated with sharebased payments in the statement of operations sfas 123r is effective for us as of january 1 2006 we historically accounted for sharebased payments to employees under apb opinion no 25’s intrinsic value method as such we have not recognized compensation expense for options granted to employees we will adopt the provisions of sfas 123r under the modified prospective method in which compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of sfas 123r and compensation cost for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that are unvested as of the effective date of sfas 123r is recognized based on sfas 123 tax benefits will be recognized related to the cost for sharebased payments to the extent the equity instrument would ordinarily result in a future tax deduction under existing law tax expense will be recognized to write off excess deferred tax assets when the tax deduction upon settlement of a vested option is less than the expense recorded in the statement of operations to the extent not offset by prior tax credits for settlements where the tax deduction was greater than the fair value cost our current estimates associated with 2006 indicate that we will recognize stock option compensation expense of approximately 6 cents per share this amount is subject to revisions as we finalize certain assumptions related to 2006 including the size and nature of awards and forfeiture rates sfas 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financial cash flow rather than as operating cash flow as was required we cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on among other factors future employee stock option exercises 

  

in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 107 regarding the staff’s interpretation of sfas 123r this interpretation provides the staff’s views regarding interactions between sfas 123r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of sharebased payments for public companies the interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of sfas 123r and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided we will follow the guidance prescribed in sab no 107 in connection with our adoption of sfas 123r 

  

on november 29 2004 the fasb issued statement no 151 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 statement 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material statement 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning after january 1 2006 we have evaluated the adoption of statement 151 and have determined it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them when arrangements include multiple elements we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element all in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by 1 applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and 2 specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings 

  

inventory valuation we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase andor manufacture we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

  

value of longlived assets including intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review 1 on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and 2 on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings we completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill 

  

for 2005 and 2004 and concluded that there were no impairments while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our nonamortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 

  

employee compensation and benefits retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and post retirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations we incurred expenses of 119 million in 2005 91 million in 2004 and 62 million in 2003 for our retirement and post retirement plans we expect expenses of approximately 117 million in 2006 for our retirement and post retirement plans pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year as of january 1 2006 we estimated the expected longterm rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was 85 and was 75 for plans outside the united states we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for longterm rates of returns for our pension assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates at the measurement date if any of our assumptions were to change our pension plan expenses would also change a onequarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by 06 million for 2006 in the united states and by 02 million for 2006 for all plans outside the united states a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pretax pension expense by 20 million for 2006 in the united states and by 08 million for 2006 for all plans outside the united states we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 

  

restructuring activities our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of 1 severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades 2 costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and 3 asset impairments as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled “restructuring charges net” 

  

gains or losses on dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the year ended january 1 2006 we recognized 15 million in gains from disposition of fixed assets we also recorded 1864 million in gains from the disposition of discontinued operations which was comprised of gains from the final disposition of our aerospace fluid testing telecommunications components and technical services businesses offset by losses associated with the disposition of our fiber optics test equipment and lithography businesses any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the “gains on disposition” or “discontinued operations” line items appearing in our income statement 

  

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

  

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are operational decisions transactions facts and circumstances and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is not certain furthermore our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world where appropriate we reserve for tax matters when we believe that the likelihood of an incremental liability being incurred is probable in accordance with the provisions of fas 5 and fas 109 any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense our effective tax rate or our cash flow 

  

additionally in accordance with fas 109 we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and other income tax credits valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable improvements or other changes in our operations domestically and internationally could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

  

financial instruments 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january 1 2006 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 

  

12 months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs for the year ended january 1 2006 we did not engage in any designated cash flow hedges the notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately 1976 million at january 1 2006 and 1668 million as of january 2 2005 and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the duration of the foreign currency derivative contracts was generally 30 days for 2005 

  

market risk 

  

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk as a multinational corporation we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates these exposures can take a variety of different forms 

  

1 as our international sales grow exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial results reported sales made in foreign currencies by our international subsidiaries when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes can fluctuate due to exchange rate movements while exchange rate fluctuations can impact reported revenues and earnings this impact is purely a result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our shortterm cash flows 

  

2 in all parts of the world our subsidiaries on occasion invoice thirdparty customers in foreign currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business we refer to our subsidiaries’ primary business currencies as the “functional currencies” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency result in both realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses that directly impact our cash flows and our results of operations 

  

3 our manufacturing and distribution organization is worldwide accordingly inventories may be manufactured in one location stored in another and distributed in a third location this results in a wide array of intercompany transactions—transactions that are billed and paid in many different currencies our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore directly impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates of currencies involved 

  

4 the cash flow needs of each of our foreign subsidiaries vary through time accordingly there may be times when a subsidiary lends to or borrows from either the parent company or another affiliate these advances again being denominated in currencies other than a particular entity’s functional currency can expose it to fluctuations in exchange rates that can impact both our cash flows and results of operations 

  

5 in order to repay debt or satisfy operational needs we may remit cash from our foreign locations to the united states when this occurs we are liquidating foreign currency net asset positions and converting them into united states dollars our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore also impacted by these transactions 

  

we may use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations the derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes we specifically use forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and may use a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies the success of our hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies to the extent 

  

that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses the principal currencies we hedge are the british pound canadian dollar euro japanese yen and singapore dollar in those currencies where there is a liquid costeffective forward market we maintain hedge coverage between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure  we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days as of january 1 2006 this computation estimated that there is a 5 chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 01 million this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal 2005 the valueatrisk ranged between 01 million and 07 million and averaged approximately 03 million 

  

interest rate risk as described above our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings in january 2005 and january 2004 we effected for a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio interest rate swaps that in effect convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt these swaps were designated as fair value hedges and were marked to market in our consolidated financial statements while they remained outstanding the fair value movements in these swaps were offset by the fair value movement in the debt 

  

interest rate risk—sensitivity  as of january 1 2006 our debt portfolio was comprised of 2444 million of variable rate debt in addition our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 5023 million at january 1 2006 our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

1 changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt consisting of 2444 million of revolving debt facilities to fluctuate an increase of 10 or approximately 31 basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pretax charge to our earnings of 8 million for fiscal year 2006 

  

2 changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate as described above an increase of 10 or approximately 31 basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 8 million for fiscal year 2006 

  

3 changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest received to fluctuate

conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of january 1 2006 the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of january 1 2006 our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 1 2006 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework 

  

based on this assessment our management believes that as of january 1 2006 our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

our independent auditors have issued an audit report on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting this report appears below 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of perkinelmer inc 

wellesley massachusetts 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that perkinelmer inc and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 1 2006 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 1 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 1 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended january 1 2006 of the company and our report dated march 17 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

brand names our fluid sciences business offers its products under various brand names including belfab ®  callisto ™  centurion ™  uplex seals ™  eseals ™  rigid eseal joints ™ and pressurescience ™  

  

marketing 

  

all of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces as of january 2 2005 we had approximately 2600 internally employed sales and service representatives operating in approximately 40 countries and marketing products and services in approximately 125 countries in addition in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products 

  

raw materials and supplies 

  

each of our businesses uses raw materials and supplies that are generally readily available in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we typically do not have longterm contracts with any of our suppliers in some cases we may rely on a single supplier for particular items although we believe that we could obtain these items from alternative suppliers if necessary 

  

intellectual property 

  

we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks registered trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of each of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of each of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 

  

in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse 

  

outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a commercial product or require us to license the disputed property from third parties we are currently one of several parties defending litigation brought by enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc alleging that our life and analytical sciences business breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with the plaintiffs infringed the plaintiffs’ patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against the plaintiffs by among other things engaging in commercial development and exploitation of the plaintiffs’ patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants see “item 3 legal proceedings” for a discussion of this matter 

  

backlog 

  

we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business units due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business 

  

competition 

  

because of the wide range of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors this affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations that produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  

in our life and analytical sciences reporting segment we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation product differentiation product availability and quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well established market niches we expect the proportion of large competitors in this reporting segment to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors 

  

we do not believe any single competitor competes directly with our optoelectronics reporting segment across its full product range however we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale of specialty flashtubes and ultraspecialty lighting sources photodetectors and photodiodes and switched power supplies competition is based on price technological innovation operational efficiency and product reliability and quality 

  

competition in our fluid sciences reporting segment is typically based on product performance and innovation quality service and price in a few markets competitors are large diversified engineering and manufacturing concerns most of our competitors however are small specialized manufacturing companies offering limited product lines for narrow market segments competition for lubricant testing services is primarily from one large nonprofit institute and some customerowned laboratories and is mainly based on quality and price 

  

we believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition 

  

research and development 

  

perkinelmersponsored research and development expenditures were approximately 871 million during fiscal 2004 approximately 814 million during fiscal 2003 and approximately 850 million during fiscal 2002 

  

we directed our research and development efforts in both 2004 and 2003 primarily toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our life and analytical sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and cermax lighting within our optoelectronics reporting segment 

  

environmental matters 

  

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  

we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party for specific waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period in which our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 38 million as of january 2 2005 representing management’s estimate of the total cost for the ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the potential recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations we expect that these accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site we review these liabilities and adjust them to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or that we expect to have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows while it is possible that we may incur a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded we do not expect the potential exposure to be materially different than the amounts recorded 

  

we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs 

  

employees 

  

as of january 2 2005 we employed approximately 10000 employees several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of january 2 2005 we employed an aggregate of approximately 2100 union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory

overview 

  

we are a leading provider of scientific instruments consumables and services to the pharmaceutical biomedical environmental testing and general industrial markets we design manufacture market and service products and systems within three businesses each constituting one reporting segment 

  

   

   

   

formation of our life and analytical sciences business unit 

  

we combined our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses to form our life and analytical sciences business in the fourth quarter of 2002 to improve our operational scale which we believe is enabling us to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the combined businesses’ sales service and research and development organizations in the second quarter of 2003 we completed many of the changes involved in combining the two businesses including the integration of facilities and management reporting and other systems 

  

accounting period 

  

our fiscal year ends on the sunday nearest december 31 we report fiscal years under a 5253 week format under this method certain years will contain 53 weeks the fiscal year ended january 2 2005 included 53 weeks the fiscal years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002 included 52 weeks we believe that this additional week of operations had a 29 million beneficial impact on revenue and an immaterial impact on operating profit

cost of sales 

  

2004 compared to 2003 cost of sales for 2004 was 10067 million versus 9008 million for 2003 an increase of 1059 million or 118 as a percentage of sales cost of sales increased to 597 in 2004 from 588 in 2003 resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 90 basis points from 412 in 2003 to 403 in 2004 the decrease in gross margin was largely attributable to greater revenue contribution as a percentage of overall sales from optoelectronics and fluid sciences versus life and analytical sciences although our optoelectronics and fluid sciences segments have lower gross margins than our life and analytical sciences segment they also have lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales 

  

2003 compared to 2002 cost of sales for 2003 was 9008 million versus 8985 million for 2002 an increase of 23 million or 02 as a percentage of sales cost of sales decreased to 588 in 2003 from 599 in 2002 resulting in an increase in gross margin of 110 basis points from 401 in 2002 to 412 in 2003 the 110 basis point increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a 2002 172 million inventory adjustment charge recorded within our optoelectronics segment we did not record a similar charge in 2003 

  

research and development expenses 

  

2004 compared to 2003 research and development expenses for 2004 were 871 million versus 814 million in 2003 an increase of 57 million or 7 as a percentage of sales research and development expenses decreased to 52 in 2004 from 53 in 2003 due to the increase in sales we directed research and development efforts during 2004 and 2003 primarily toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our life and analytical sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and cermax lighting within our optoelectronics reporting segment we expect our research and development spending to increase in 2005 and to continue to emphasize the health sciences end markets 

  

2003 compared to 2002 research and development expenses for 2003 were 814 million versus 850 million in 2002 a decrease of 36 million or 4 as a percentage of sales research and development expenses decreased to 53 in 2003 from 57 in 2002 primarily due to our consolidation of research and development activities to take advantage of increased synergies and corresponding cost savings as a result of fewer sites we directed research and development efforts during 2003 and 2002 primarily toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our life and analytical sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and industrial sensors within our optoelectronics reporting segment 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

2004 compared to 2003 selling general and administrative expenses for 2004 were 3875 million versus 3860 million for 2003 an increase of 15 million or 04 as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased 220 basis points to 230 in 2004 from 252 in 2003 the decrease as a percentage of sales of 220 basis points in 2004 was predominately due to net productivity improvements and cost reductions in our life and analytical sciences reporting segment 

  

2003 compared to 2002 selling general and administrative expenses for 2003 were 3860 million versus 4308 million for 2002 a decrease of 448 million or 10 as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased 350 basis points to 252 in 2003 from 287 in 2002 proportionately the decrease as a percentage of sales of 350 basis points in 2003 was due to a 200 basis point decrease attributable to reduced expenses in life and analytical sciences a 100 basis point decrease in optoelectronics and a 50 basis point decrease in fluid sciences the overall decrease in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to productivity improvements throughout our company including cost savings we derived from restructuring actions 

  

restructuring reversals charges net 

  

2004 compared to 2003 restructuring charges for 2004 were zero versus 35 million of net reversals for 2003 the 2003 reversals comprised a combination of our 2003 changes in estimates of 58 million and our 2003 charges of 23 million the following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

q2 2003 plan 

  

during 2003 we incurred a 23 million restructuring charge in life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics which we refer to as our “q2 2003 plan” the purpose of the restructuring was to further improve performance and take advantage of synergies between our former life sciences and analytical instruments businesses which we began integrating in the fourth quarter of 2002 the principal actions in this restructuring plan included lower headcount due to the continued integration of the life and analytical sciences business in a european manufacturing and customer care center as well as headcount reduction at one of the optoelectronics manufacturing facilities to reflect recent declining demand for several product lines we planned to reduce headcount by 120 we recorded restructuring charges by segment for 2003 as follows 

  

   

this restructuring charge was primarily recorded in the second quarter of 2003 however we recorded additional charges of 05 million and 01 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 as required by sfas 146 as some employees who were notified of their employment termination in the second quarter were required to work for a period of time prior to receiving their severance in addition in the fourth quarter of 2003 we 

  

recorded a pretax restructuring reversal of 04 million due to 30 fewer employee terminations as a result of higher attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and accordingly lower severance costs 

  

during 2004 we completed all actions under the q2 2003 plan with the exception of a headcount reduction of one person that we expect to complete by the second quarter of 2005 

  

q4 2002 plan 

  

in connection with our decision to combine our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 260 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 which we refer to as our q4 2002 plan the q4 2002 plan allowed us to combine many business functions worldwide with the intention to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses’ sales service and research and development organizations the principal actions in the q4 2002 plan included planned workforce reductions of 546 people closure of approximately 20 facilities and disposal of underutilized assets 

  

the q4 2002 plan resulted in the integration of our united states life and analytical sciences sales service and customer care centers the integration of european customer care and finance centers the merging of a former life sciences european manufacturing facility with a former analytical instruments european manufacturing facility and the merging of a portion of a former life sciences research and development facility in europe with a former analytical instruments facility in europe 

  

during 2003 we expended 138 million to execute these actions in addition we recorded a reversal of 62 million in the q4 2002 plan due to 182 fewer terminations as a result of higher than expected employee attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and lower severance costs for actual terminations 

  

during 2004 we expended an additional 33 million to execute these actions the remaining liability associated with the q4 2002 plan represents severance related to 11 employees and ongoing lease commitments we expect to settle the remaining severance liability by the end of the first quarter of 2005 our current estimate is that our lease commitments on unoccupied buildings vary in length but primarily extend until mid2005 

  

q1 2002 plan 

  

during the first quarter of 2002 our management developed a plan to restructure several businesses we refer to these activities as our q1 2002 plan the plan resulted in pretax restructuring charges totaling 92 million the principal actions in the q1 2002 plan included planned workforce and overhead reductions resulting from reorganization activities including the closure of a manufacturing facility disposal of underutilized assets and general cost reductions 

  

q1 2002 plan charges in our life and analytical sciences segment totaled 55 million these charges comprised 44 million in severance costs 10 million in asset impairments and 01 million in lease commitments the charges were a result of actions we took as a response to decreased sales of components in our life and analytical sciences business these actions under the charges primarily included the downsizing of an additional manufacturing location and streamlining of the global sales and research and development organizations primarily in europe japan and the pacific rim we took these actions to reduce the number of employees in components of our business that had experienced declining demand 

  

q1 2002 plan charges in our optoelectronics segment totaled 37 million comprising 35 million in severance costs and 02 million in asset writeoffs this charge was primarily due to the removal of a layer of management structure within our optoelectronics reporting segment which led to a flatter and less expensive organization structure 

  

total headcount was reduced by 276 

  

during 2003 we recorded a restructuring reversal of 10 million in the q1 2002 plan primarily due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with our optoelectronics segment 

  

during 2004 we expended 01 million to complete the remaining actions associated with the q1 2002 plan 

  

q4 2001 plan 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2001 in connection with the integration of packard and a restructuring of our sales offices in europe we recorded a restructuring charge of 92 million in our life and analytical sciences segment and incurred 16 million in charges in 2002 we refer to these activities as our q4 2001 plan the principal actions in the q4 2001 plan included the closing or consolidation of several leased sales and services offices in europe as well as costs associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in europe the closure of leased manufacturing facilities in the united states and the disposal of related assets 

  

in 2003 we recorded an additional pretax restructuring charge associated with the q4 2001 plan of 18 million this charge was primarily due to additional severance and severance related benefits of the previously identified employees associated with the closure of our european manufacturing facility in the life and analytical sciences segment 

  

in 2004 we expended 10 million to execute the actions associated with the q4 2001 plan we will pay the remaining balance in 2005 for previously identified employees associated with the closure of our european manufacturing facility in the life and analytical sciences segment 

  

losses gains on dispositions 

  

2004 compared to 2003 dispositions resulted in a net loss of 04 million in 2004 versus a net gain of 27 million in 2003 loss on dispositions in 2004 included a 07 million loss from the sale of a business and was partially offset by a 03 million gain from the sale of facilities gains on dispositions in 2003 included 22 million from sales of facilities and 05 million from post closing adjustments relating to the resolution of contingencies related to the sale of our instruments for research and applied sciences business which we refer to as iras 

  

2003 compared to 2002 dispositions resulted in a net gain of 27 million in 2003 versus a net gain of 52 million in 2002 gains on dispositions in 2002 included 44 million from the sale of facilities and 08 million from post closing entries relating to our sale of our iras business which was formerly part of our life and analytical sciences segment 

  

amortization of intangible assets 

  

2004 compared to 2003 amortization of intangible assets was 285 million in 2004 and 283 million in 2003 slight increases in the life and analytical sciences amortization due to the effect of foreign exchange were partially offset by slight decreases in fluid sciences amortization 

  

2003 compared to 2002 amortization of intangible assets was 283 million for both 2003 and 2002 slight increases in the life and analytical sciences amortization due to the effect of foreign exchange were offset by slight decreases in optoelectronics and fluid sciences amortization 

  

interest and other expense net 

  

interest and other expense net consisted of the following 

  

   

2004 compared to 2003  interest and other expense net for 2004 was 403 million versus 564 million for 2003 a decrease of 161 million or 29 the decrease in interest and other expense net in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due primarily to approximately 1000 million of lower average outstanding term loan balances combined with lower interest rates applicable to our term loan due to an amendment of our credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2003 a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” the remaining decrease in interest and other expense was the result of i swapping 100 million of our 8875 notes from fixed rate debt to a floating rate based on sixmonth usd libor in january 2004 resulting in a 22 million decrease in interest expense and ii 23 million of net interest expense not incurred in 2004 as it was related to our zero coupon convertible debentures which we redeemed in 2003 the decrease in interest and other expense was partially offset by our increased acceleration of debt issuance costs of 41 million resulting from partial prepayments of our term debt during 2004 versus 19 million in 2003 we expect interest expense in 2005 to decrease due to lower outstanding debt balances and the expected benefit derived from the january 2005 swapping of an additional 100 million of our 8875 notes from fixed rate debt to a floating rate based on sixmonth usd libor 

  

2003 compared to 2002  interest and other expense net for 2003 was 564 million versus 329 million for 2002 an increase of 235 million or 71 the increase in interest and other expense net in 2003 as compared to 2002 was due primarily to higher average borrowing rates resulting from our financing completed in december 2002 the remaining increase in interest and other expense net of 30 million was due primarily to our increased acceleration of the amortization of debt issuance costs of 19 million resulting from partial prepayments of our term debt during 2003 versus 04 million in 2002 and 06 million of transaction costs we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2003 in connection with amending our credit facility to reduce the margin applicable to our term loan 

  

provisionbenefit for income taxes 

  

2004 compared to 2003 the 2004 provision for income taxes was 385 million versus a provision of 275 million in 2003 the 2004 effective tax rate was 282 as compared to the 2003 effective tax rate of 322 the change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to 104 million of benefit associated with the resolution of our successful appeal in 2004 of an internal revenue service audit finding with respect to our 1997 and 1998 taxes additional benefits resulting from the conclusion of canadian and uk tax audits reduction in state tax expense and our use of existing and our reduced generation of new net operating losses these benefits were partially offset by an accrual of 87 million for the estimated us tax cost of repatriation calculated under the homeland investment provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 

  

2003 compared to 2002 the 2003 provision for income taxes was 275 million versus a benefit of 35 million in 2002 our 2003 effective tax rate was 322 as compared to our 2002 effective tax rate of 697 the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a relatively high ratio in 2002 of permanent tax differences to loss from continuing operations before income taxes 

  

discontinued operations 

  

we recorded the following gains and losses which we report as the loss on dispositions of discontinued operations during the years ended january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 

  

   

as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities in june 2004 we approved a plan to shut down our electroformed products business and sell our ultraviolet lighting business in september 2004 we approved a plan to shut down our computertoplate business we previously had reported the results of all three of these businesses as part of the optoelectronics reporting segment we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 144 and accordingly have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as part of discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying balance sheets as of january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 the net assets of the electroformed products business were written off resulting in a 16 million pretax loss for the year ended january 2 2005 we sold the fixed assets and inventory of the ultraviolet lighting business in july 2004 for their approximate book value the abandonment of the computertoplate business resulted in a 10 million writedown of fixed assets and inventory which we recognized in our loss on dispositions for the year ended january 2 2005 

  

during 2004 and 2003 we settled various claims under certain longterm contracts and transition services with our technical services business which we sold in august 1999 the net settlement and the reversal of certain previously established contingencies resulted in pretax gains of 15 million in 2004 and 65 million in 2003 that are included in gain loss on dispositions of discontinued operations we reversed contingencies in the period in which the related issues were resolved we may increase or reverse remaining contingencies in the future pending resolution of the underlying matters 

  

in june 2002 we completed the sale of our security and detection systems business for cash consideration of approximately 1000 million and a net working capital adjustment we recorded a net pretax gain of approximately 150 million pursuant to this transaction in 2002 as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations we accounted for our security and detection systems business as a discontinued operation in accordance with apb no 30 and accordingly the results of operations and related cash flows of this business through the disposal date were segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line on our consolidated income statements we have presented the resulting gain from the sale as a component of net income within dispositions of discontinued operations net of income tax on our 2002 consolidated income statement adjustments relating to this sale resulted in a pretax loss from discontinued operations of 24 million in 2003 primarily due to revised estimates of the working capital adjustment 

  

in june 2002 our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our telecommunications components business as of june 30 2002 and a plan to sell our entertainment lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have reflected both businesses as discontinued operations in 

  

our consolidated financial statements as of june 29 2003 we had exited our entertainment lighting business completing the sale of a substantial portion of that business for cash consideration of 14 million and abandoning the remaining assets we recorded a gain of 03 million in fiscal 2004 and a net loss of 20 million in fiscal 2003 pursuant to this transaction 

  

summary operating results of the discontinued operations of the security and detection systems telecommunications component entertainment lighting electroformed products ultraviolet lighting and computertoplate businesses for the periods prior to disposition were as follows 

  

   

effect of accounting change 

  

as required by sfas 142 we completed the transitional impairment analysis of our recorded goodwill as of january 1 2002 in connection with the adoption of this standard we reviewed our forecasts and projections of all of our reporting units and determined that based on decreased demand for certain specialty lamps resulting from a downturn in the printed circuit board production worldwide and other smaller markets the fair value of the lighting reporting unit was less than its carrying value with the assistance of valuation specialists and using a discounted cash flow model we determined that the carrying value of the recorded goodwill was in excess of the fair value of that goodwill as a result we recorded an impairment charge totaling 1178 million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change the entire transition adjustment related to our lighting reporting unit within our optoelectronics reporting segment in addition as part of our ongoing compliance with sfas no 142 we completed our annual assessment of goodwill using a measurement date of january 3 2005 this annual assessment did not result in an impairment charge 

  

acquisitions and divestitures 

  

in february 2005 we acquired elcos ag a leading european designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode or led solutions for biomedical and industrial applications the transaction combines elcos’ visible led technology platform and strong customer and application base with our global sales application and support organization therefore expanding the sales growth opportunities for the elcos technology consideration for the transaction was approximately 151 million in cash at the time of closing with additional consideration of approximately 14 million due through fiscal 2007 in addition potential earn out payments of up to approximately 82 million may be made based on the future performance of the business 

  

in november 2001 we completed our acquisition of packard bioscience company the integration activities are complete with the exception of 04 million in remaining payments due on leased facilities exited in 2001 that will be paid through 2005 these integration activities are linked to the q4 2001 plan and are disclosed in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

the following table summarizes integration reserve activity during 2004 2003 and 2002 related to the acquisition of packard 

  

   

contingencies 

  

we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 38 million as of january 2 2005 representing our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations while it is possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred we do not expect the potential exposure to be materially different from the amounts we recorded 

  

we and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit filed in july 2002 and we and certain officers and directors have been named as defendants in purported derivative lawsuits filed in june and july 2004 the plaintiffs in all of these suits have alleged among other things various statements made by the company and management during the same time period for all three suits were misleading with respect to our prospects and future operating results further information with respect to these lawsuits is contained in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and are contesting the actions vigorously we are currently unable however to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss if any that may result from the resolution of these matters 

  

we previously received a notice from the internal revenue service asserting federal income tax deficiencies for 1997 and 1998 the company and the internal revenue service resolved these matters in 2004 as a result of the settlement we have reversed the reserves of 104 million that had been established in accordance with fas 5 based on our previous assessment of the resolution of these matters which assessment was less favorable than the ultimate outcome 

  

we are under regular examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities in the united states and other countries such as canada finland and the united kingdom and states in which we have significant business operations such as california and new york the tax years under examination vary by 

  

jurisdiction for example the irs is currently examining 1999 through 2002 assuming current progress we expect the irs examination to be completed in fiscal 2005 we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years’ examinations tax reserves have been established which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments once established reserves are adjusted as information becomes available and when an event occurs requiring a change to the reserves the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition although such settlement could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and consolidated statement of income for a particular future period

operating profit for 2004 was 382 million versus 179 million for 2003 an increase of 203 million or 113 the increase in operating profit resulted primarily from increased sales shifting production to lower cost locations in asia other productivity improvements resulting from six sigma and lean manufacturing initiatives amortization of intangible assets was 9 million for 2004 and 11 million for 2003 

  

2003 compared to 2002 sales for 2003 were 1797 million versus 1895 million for 2002 a decrease of 98 million or 5 changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately 24 million the following analysis of significant sales by product line for 2003 as compared to 2002 includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates sales decreased 44 million in our semiconductor products due to declining demand and 27 million in our energy technology products in addition sales to our aerospace and fluid testing customers declined modestly by 17 million and 10 million respectively in two difficult markets 

  

operating profit for 2003 was 179 million versus 175 million for 2002 an increase of 04 million or 2 the increase in operating profit resulted primarily from shifting production to lower cost locations in asia cost controls cost reduction actions and other productivity improvements resulting from six sigma and lean manufacturing initiatives that more than offset an operating profit decrease due to reduced sales amortization of intangible assets was 11 million for 2003 and 15 million for 2002

we require cash to pay our operating expenses make capital expenditures service our debt and other longterm liabilities and pay dividends on our common stock our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets particularly the debt markets in the near term we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses capital expenditures interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock in the longterm we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other longterm liabilities 

  

principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include 

  

   

   

   

principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

cash flows 

  

fiscal year 2004 

  

operating activities net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was 1995 million in 2004 contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2004 was net income from continuing operations of 983 million depreciation and amortization of 762 million and a decrease in working capital accounts of 49 million contributing to the decrease in working capital in 2004 were decreases in accounts receivable of 146 million and inventory of 19 million offset by decreases in accounts payable of 116 million in general accounts receivable collections increased due primarily to our focus on improved processes and collections whereas inventory balances decreased primarily due to improved logistics and inventory management processes accounts payable decreased primarily due to timing of payments there was no incremental use of our accounts receivable securitization facility during 2004 the outstanding amount under this facility totaled 450 million at both january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 as discussed under “offbalance sheet arrangements” we had approximately 20 million of undrawn capacity available under the facility at january 2 2005 

  

investing activities investing activities related to continuing operations used 123 million in 2004 in 2004 we made capital expenditures of 190 million mainly for tooling and productivity improvements and for 

  

system and facility costs we derived 34 million from sales of a building and equipment and 28 million from the settlement of an escrow related to an entity acquired in 2000

fiscal year 2003 

  

operating activities net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was 1637 million in 2003 contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2003 was net income from continuing operations of 579 million depreciation and amortization of 795 million and a decrease in working capital accounts of 709 million contributing to the decrease in working capital in 2003 were reductions in accounts receivable of 434 million and inventory of 282 million in general accounts receivable and inventory levels declined due to our focus on customer payment terms as well as enhanced inventory management accounts receivable also decreased as a result of increased use of our accounts receivable securitization facility which increased 16 million from 29 million at december 29 2002 to 45 million at january 2 2005 cash outlays for accrued expenses restructuring and other assets and liabilities totaled 460 million during 2003 primarily as a result of payments toward restructuring plans and other obligations we expect our restructuring expenditures to be reduced in 2004 

  

investing activities in 2003 we withdrew 1875 million of cash held in escrow to retire substantially all of our remaining outstanding indebtedness under our zero coupon convertible debentures in 2003 we made capital expenditures of 166 million mainly in the areas of tooling and productivity improvements along with system and facility costs related to integration activities net proceeds from the dispositions of businesses and fixed assets during 2003 were 44 million we derived 49 million of these proceeds from the sale of a building made redundant due to integration activities 

  

financing activities  in 2003 we used 2984 million of net cash in financing activities we expended 1875 million of cash withdrawn from our designated escrow account along with approximately 24 million of available cash to redeem our outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures debt reductions during 2003 also included 700 million of cash used to repay a portion of our term loan in december 2003 we amended our credit facility to among other things reduce the interest rate applicable to our term loan we paid 44 million transaction in fees during 2003 in connection with that amendment we also paid 354 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 36 million in 2003 

  

borrowing arrangements 

  

senior secured credit facility in december 2002 we entered into a senior credit facility this facility comprises a sixyear term loan in the amount of 3150 million and a 1000 million fiveyear revolving credit facility in 2004 we made 1750 million of principal payments on the term loan accordingly at january 2 2005 we had 700 million outstanding under our term loan and no outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility at january 2 2005 or at any other time 

  

interest rates under the senior credit facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit facility are determined as a margin over either the eurodollar rate or the base rate the base rate is the higher of 1 the corporate base rate announced from time to time by bank of america na and 2 the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points the applicable margins for the term loan and the revolving credit facility vary based upon our leverage ratio at the end of the prior quarter the applicable margin as of january 2 2005 was 200 basis points for the eurodollar rate and 100 basis points for the base rate we may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based upon the margin over the eurodollar rate or the base rate at 

  

january 2 2005 the eurodollar rate was approximately 247 basis points and the base rate was 525 basis points resulting in a eurodollar interest rate on the senior credit facility of 447 basis points 

  

in october 2004 we amended our senior credit facility to allow greater flexibility regarding acquisitions stock repurchases debt reduction and cash repatriation the amount of permitted acquisitions and any related indebtedness was raised from 125 million to 250 million the amount of indebtedness related to acquisitions is subject to compliance with all financial covenants 

  

the term loan is repayable in mandatory nominal quarterly installments of 08 million of the outstanding balance until december 2007 and thereafter in four equal quarterly installments of 25 of the then outstanding balance until december 2008 additionally annual principal payments as a percentage of excess cash flow defined as a ratio based on our cash flow and leverage ratio in the credit agreement are payable six months following the end of each fiscal year we are not required to make any such principal payment in 2005 with respect to our 2004 excess cash flow in 2004 we made 175 million in principal payments on the term loan the revolving credit facility is available to us through december 2007 for our working capital needs at no point in fiscal 2004 nor at any other time did we have any outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility 

  

our senior credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specific financial ratios including 

  

   

   

   

   

as of january 2 2005 and at all other times during fiscal 2004 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 

  

8 7  8  notes in december 2002 we issued and sold tenyear senior subordinated notes at a rate of 8 7  8  with a face value of 3000 million we received 2975 million in gross proceeds from the issuance we recorded deferred issuance costs of 70 million as a noncurrent asset the debt which matures in january 2013 is unsecured but is guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries interest on our 8 7  8  notes is payable semiannually on january 15 and july 15 in january 2004 we swapped the fixed rate on 100 million of these notes to a floating rate using swap instruments which reset semiannually in arrears based upon sixmonth usd libor and an applicable spread as defined in the swap agreements in january 2005 we swapped an additional 100 million of these notes from fixed rate to floating rate at similar terms to the january 2004 swap and therefore we now pay the applicable sixmonth usd libor rate plus the applicable spread on 200 million of our obligations represented by the notes 

  

if a change of control of our company occurs each holder of 8 7  8  notes may require us to repurchase some or all of its notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest before january 15 2006 we may redeem up to 35 of the aggregate principal amount with the net proceeds of specified public equity offerings at 108875 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest if at least 65 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding after the redemption we may redeem some or all of our 8 7  8  notes at any time on or after january 15 2008 at a redemption price of 104438 the redemption price decreases to 102958 on january 15 2009 to 101479 on january 15 2010 and to 100 on january 15 2011 the debt is subordinated to our senior credit facility these notes contain financial and other covenants most of these covenants terminate if the notes obtain an investment grade rating by standard  poor’s rating services and moody’s investors service at january 2 2005 and at all times during fiscal 2004 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 

  

zero coupon convertible debentures through the first quarter of 2003 we repurchased 3447 million in accreted amount of our zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 in open market purchases and through a 

  

december 2002 tender offer we redeemed the remaining 1574 million of accreted value of zero coupon debentures on august 7 2003 in accordance with their terms we used approximately 1550 million held in escrow pursuant to the terms of our senior secured credit facility along with available cash of approximately 24 million to redeem the zero coupon convertible debentures as of december 28 2003 the zero coupon convertible debentures had been fully retired 

  

68 notes in december 2002 we initiated a tender offer for all of our outstanding 68 notes we completed the tender offer and repurchased all but 47 million of these notes as of december 26 2002 we paid consent payments pursuant to a consent solicitation we made concurrently with the tender offer the consent solicitation eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our 68 notes as of december 29 2002 we may from time to time repurchase outstanding 68 notes through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise the remaining 47 million in notes are due to be paid in october 2005 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

receivables securitization facility 

  

in december 2001 we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to purchase on a revolving basis certain of our accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution in september 2003 we amended the facility to increase total funding capacity from 500 million to 650 million to expand our sources of liquidity amounts funded under this facility were 450 million at both january 2 2005 and december 28 2003 as of january 2 2005 we had approximately 20 million of undrawn capacity available under the facility the facility had an effective interest rate of approximately libor plus 74 basis points as of january 2 2005 the facility includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of bb or above as defined by standard  poor’s rating services and ba2 or above as defined by moody’s investors service at january 2 2005 we had a senior unsecured credit rating of bb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s rating services and of ba2 with a positive outlook from moody’s investors service the facility expires on january 27 2006 

  

dividends 

  

our board of directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2004 and 2003 resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per share our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding 8 7  8  senior subordinated notes contain restrictions that may limit our ability to pay our regular quarterly cash dividend in the future if we are unable to comply with certain financial covenants that primarily relate to cash flow 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january 2 2005 

  

   

capital expenditures 

  

during 2005 we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately 25 million to 35 million primarily to introduce new products to improve our operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to capitalize expenses related to internally developed information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

  

future accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued fasb no 123r sharebased payment  this statement is a revision of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion or apb no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related implementation guidance sfas no 123r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions the statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grantdate fair value of those awards with limited exceptions sfas no 123r is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june 15 2005 

  

we expect to adopt sfas no 123r using the statement’s modified prospective application method we expect our adoption of sfas no 123r to increase stock compensation expense we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 123r will have on our financial results 

  

on november 29 2004 the fasb issued statement no 151 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 statement 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material statement 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we are evaluating the potential impact if any the adoption of statement 151 will have on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element we recognize product revenue upon delivery and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them when arrangements include multiple elements we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element all in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  because the majority of our sales relate to specific 

  

manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant product returns or refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by 1 applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and 2 specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings 

  

inventory valuation we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase andor manufacture we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

  

value of longlived assets including intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review 1 on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and 2 on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the 2002 initial assessment of goodwill recoverability under sfas no 142 resulted in a 1178 million charge to our earnings this charge relating to goodwill in our lighting reporting unit within our optoelectronics business segment was caused by expected declines in profitability and cash flows as a result of softness in key endmarkets we completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill for 2003 and 2004 and concluded that there was no impairment while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not being amortized at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas 142 these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 

  

employee compensation and benefits retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation retirement and post retirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations we incurred expenses of 91 million in 2004 62 million in 2003 and 39 million in 2002 for our retirement and post retirement plans we expect expenses of approximately 128 million in 2005 for our retirement and post retirement plans pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or 

  

expense for the year as of january 2 2005 we estimated the expected longterm rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was 85 percent and was 75 percent for plans outside the united states we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions have been and continue to be based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates at the measurement date if any of our assumptions were to change our pension plan expenses would also change a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pretax pension expense by 21 million for 2005 in the united states and by 07 million for 2005 for all plans outside the united states we have reduced the volatility in our health care costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for health care costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the health care needs of that retiree our maximum future liability therefore cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of health care 

  

restructuring activities our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of 1 severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades 2 costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and 3 asset impairments as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled “restructuring charges net” 

  

gains or losses on dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the year ended january 2 2005 we recognized 04 million in losses from disposition of a business and excess facilities we also recorded 05 million in losses from the disposition of discontinued operations comprised of gains from the final disposition of our telecommunications components and technical services businesses these gains were offset by losses associated with the disposition of our electroformed products and computertoplate businesses any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the “gains on disposition” or “discontinued operations” line items appearing in our income statement 

  

income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in more than 40 countries tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax position any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

  

our tax positions are consistently subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world where appropriate we reserve for tax matters where we believe that there is a significant likelihood of an 

  

incremental liability being incurred any significant changes as a result of changes in underlying facts law tax rates tax audit or review could lead to adjustments in our effective tax rate or cash flow 

  

in addition we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and other credits valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to ultimately use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed to be recoverable improvements or other changes in our operations domestically and internationally could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 

  

the fasb also issued fasb staff position or fsp no 1092 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004  the american jobs creation act introduces a special onetime dividends received deduction on the repatriation of specified foreign earnings to a us taxpayer provided criteria are met fsp 1092 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision until the treasury department or congress provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision the total amount of foreign earnings to be repatriated by us cannot be determined and the presumption that such unremitted earnings will not be repatriated cannot be overcome fsp 1092 grants an enterprise additional time beyond the year ended december 31 2004 in which the act was enacted to evaluate the effects of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted earnings fsp 1092 calls for enhanced disclosures of among other items the status of a company’s evaluations the effects of completed evaluations and the potential range of income tax effects of repatriations such disclosures are included in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

forwardlooking information and factors affecting future performance 

  

the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

  

economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales 

  

because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented more than 50 of our total sales in the fiscal year ended january 2 2005 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer 

  

we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products could become technologically obsolete over time in which case our sales and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products therefore we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales 

  

in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications for example some of our license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research and exclude clinical diagnostics applications 

  

our debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities 

  

as of january 2 2005 we had approximately 3746 million in outstanding indebtedness 

  

we have 1000 million in additional borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility and 20 million under our receivable securitization program we may also obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

  

our leverage could have negative consequences including 

  

   

   

   

   

approximately 70 million of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates pursuant to the terms of the original agreements however after giving effect to the interest rate swaps entered into in january 2004 and january 2005 approximately 270 million of our indebtedness now bears interest at floating rates as a result our interest payment obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase 

  

our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not 

  

generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy if we are unable to service our debt and fund our business we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or research and development expenditures seek additional financing or equity capital restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

  

restrictions in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our 8 7  8  notes may limit our activities 

  

our senior credit facility and the indenture relating to our 8 7  8  notes contain and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 

  

our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under our senior credit facility would trigger an event of default under our 8 7  8  notes and a default under our 8 7  8  notes would trigger an event of default under the senior credit facility and possibly other debt 

  

if an event of default occurs we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under our indebtedness if we are unable to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility those lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings under that agreement our inability to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility may also cause a default under other of our obligations including our accounts receivable securitization facility 

  

our operating results may could be harmed by cyclical downturns affecting several of the industries into which we sell our products 

  

some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical industry downturns are often characterized by reduced product demand excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling 

  

prices and profits in the past significant downturns in our customers’ markets and in general economic conditions have resulted in a reduced demand for several of our products and have hurt our operating results for example during 2002 our operating results were reduced by downturns in many of the markets we serve including the pharmaceutical biomedical semiconductor and aerospace markets 

  

our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we may not be able to make those adjustments or to make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing business or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 

  

we have in the past and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our acquisition of elcos ag in february 2005 however we may be unable to identify complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations such as incompatible management information or other systems or cultural differences 

  

to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us 

  

if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 

  

we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 

  

our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

  

if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed 

  

we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

  

if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

  

some of the products produced by our life and analytical sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar international agencies in addition some of the activities of our fluid sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the united states federal aviation administration these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales resales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution we had to do this on a temporary basis in 2004 in response to an fda directive at one of our life and analytical sciences locations until we were able to resolve the matter by implementing additional testing and labeling conditions on the relevant product in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

  

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 

  

we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

  

obtaining and enforcing patent protection for our proprietary products processes and technologies may be difficult and expensive we may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties 

  

patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing and marketing new technologies and products is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to 

  

apply for additional patents to cover our products we may not obtain issued patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology 

  

third parties may seek to challenge invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to us or claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 

  

in addition to our patents we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties the measures that we employ to protect this technology and these rights may not be adequate moreover in some cases the licensor can terminate a license or convert it to a nonexclusive arrangement if we fail to meet specified performance targets 

  

we may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties in addition claims of third parties against us such as the pending actions by respectively enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc and by amersham biosciences corp and amersham plc could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or abroad 

  

our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 

  

as of january 2 2005 our total assets included 15 billion of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization we test these items on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned 

  

adverse changes in our business or the failure to grow our life and analytical sciences business may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

  

financial instruments 

  

financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january 2 2005 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs for the year ended january 2 2005 we did not engage in any designated cash flow hedges the notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately 1668 million at january 2 2005 and 1685 million as of december 28 2003 and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant the duration of the foreign currency derivative contracts was generally 30 days for 2004 

  

market risk 

  

market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 

  

foreign exchange risk as a multinational corporation we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates these exposures can take a variety of different forms 

  

1 as our international sales grow exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial results reported sales made in foreign currencies by our international subsidiaries when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes can fluctuate due to exchange rate movements while exchange rate fluctuations can impact reported revenues and earnings this impact is purely a result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our shortterm cash flows 

  

2 in all parts of the world our subsidiaries on occasion invoice thirdparty customers in foreign currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business we refer to our subsidiaries’ primary business currencies as the “functional currencies” movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency result in both realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses that directly impact our cash flows and our results of operations 

  

3 our manufacturing and distribution organization is worldwide accordingly inventories may be manufactured in one location stored in another and distributed in a third location this results in a wide array of intercompany transactions—transactions that are billed and paid in many different currencies our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore directly impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates of currencies involved 

  

4 the cash flow needs of each of our foreign subsidiaries vary through time accordingly there may be times when a subsidiary lends to or borrows from either the parent company or another affiliate these advances again being denominated in currencies other than a particular entity’s functional currency can expose it to fluctuations in exchange rates that can impact both our cash flows and results of operations 

  

5 in order to repay debt or satisfy operational needs we may remit cash from our foreign locations to the united states when this occurs we are liquidating foreign currency net asset positions and converting them into united states dollars our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore also impacted by these transactions 

  

we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations the derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes we specifically use forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and use a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies the success of our hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses the principal currencies we hedge are the british pound canadian dollar euro japanese yen and singapore dollar in those currencies where there is a liquid costeffective forward market we maintain hedge coverage between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure 

  

foreign currency risk—valueatrisk disclosure —we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days as of january 2 2005 this computation estimated that there is a 5 chance that the market value of the 

  

underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 01 million this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal 2004 the valueatrisk ranged between 01 million and 03 million and averaged approximately 02 million 

  

interest rate risk as described above our debt portfolio includes both fixed rate and variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings in january 2005 and january 2004 we effected for a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio interest rate swaps that in effect convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt these swaps have been designated as fair value hedges these swaps are marked to market in our consolidated financial statements the fair value movements in these swaps are offset by the fair value movement in the debt 

  

interest rate risk—sensitivity —as of january 2 2005 our debt portfolio was comprised of 3046 million fixed rate debt and 700 million of variable rate debt after giving effect to the interest rate swaps entered into in january 2004 and january 2005 1046 million of our debt portfolio is fixed and 2700 million is variable in addition our cash and cash equivalents for which we receive interest at variable rates were 1975 million at january 2 2005 our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

  

1 changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt comprised of 70 million of term loan and 200 million of swapped 8 7  8  notes to fluctuate a 10 increase or approximately 64 basis points in current interest rates would cause an additional pretax charge to our earnings of 17 million for fiscal year 2005 

  

2 changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate as described above an increase of 10 or approximately 64 basis points in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 17 million for fiscal year 2005 

  

3 changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest received to fluctuate 

  

4 changes in interest rates can cause the value of our fixed rate debt to change however such a value change has no impact on either our earnings or our cash flows unless we determine that we wish to retire this debt in the open market

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend   

conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of january 2 2005 the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of january 2 2005 our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2005 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework 

  

based on this assessment our management believes that as of january 2 2005 our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

  

our independent auditors have issued an audit report on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting this report appears below 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of perkinelmer inc 

wellesley massachusetts 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that perkinelmer inc and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2005 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2005 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended january 2 2005 of the company and our report dated march 10 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

analytical instruments businesses we combined our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses to improve our operational scale which we believe will enable us to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses’ sales service and research and development organization in the second quarter of 2003 we completed many of the changes involved in combining the two businesses including the integration of facilities management reporting and other systems we achieved in excess of the original range of 12 to 25 million in pretax cost savings in fiscal 2003 from the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses relative to our fiscal 2002 cost levels we are targeting additional pretax cost savings from the combination of between 50 million and 200 million in fiscal 2004 for a combined pretax cost savings of between 300 million and 450 million relative to our fiscal 2002 cost levels unforeseen factors may offset some or all of

sales forces as of december 28 2003 we had approximately 2600 internally employed sales and service representatives operating in approximately 40 countries and marketing products and services in approximately 125 countries in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence we utilize distributors to sell our products raw materials and supplies   each of our businesses uses raw materials and supplies that are generally readily available in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we typically do not have longterm contracts with any of our suppliers in some cases we may rely on a single supplier for particular items although we believe that we could obtain these items from alternative suppliers if necessary intellectual property   we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks registered trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of each of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of each of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments 7   in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a commercial product or require us to license the disputed property from third parties we are currently one of several parties defending litigation brought by enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc alleging that our life and analytical sciences business breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with the plaintiffs infringed the plaintiffs’ patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against the plaintiffs by among other things engaging in commercial development and exploitation of the plaintiffs’ patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants on july 16 2003 enzo life sciences served its new complaint and we subsequently filed an answer denying the substantive allegations and including a counterclaim alleging that several of enzo’s patents are invalid see “item 3 legal proceedings” for a discussion of this matter backlog   we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business units due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business competition   because of the wide range of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors this affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations that produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments   in our life and analytical sciences reporting segment we compete on the basis of service level price technological innovation product differentiation product availability and quality and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have wellestablished market niches we expect the proportion of large competitors in this reporting segment to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors   no single competitor competes directly with our optoelectronics reporting segment across its full product range however we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale of specialty flashtubes and ultraspecialty lighting sources photodetectors and photodiodes and switched power supplies competition is based on price technological innovation operational efficiency and product reliability and quality   competition in our fluid sciences reporting segment is typically based on product performance and innovation quality service and price in a few markets competitors are large diversified engineering and manufacturing concerns most of our competitors however are small specialized manufacturing companies offering limited product lines for narrow market segments competition for lubricant testing services is primarily from one large nonprofit institute and some customerowned laboratories and is mainly based on quality and price   we believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition research and development   perkinelmersponsored research and development expenditures were approximately 831 million during 2003 approximately 865 million during 2002 and approximately 801 million during 2001 8   we directed our research and development efforts in both 2003 and 2002 primarily in the genetic screening applications markets and the biopharmaceutical end markets within our life and analytical sciences business and in the medical digital imaging and industrial sensor markets within our optoelectronics business environmental matters   our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees   we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and expect to incur costs pursuant to these statutes   we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party for specific waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period in which our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 62 million as of december 28 2003 representing management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we are named a potentially responsible party our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that these accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site we review these liabilities and adjust them to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or that we expect to have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows while it is possible that we may incur a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded we do not expect the potential exposure to be materially different than the amounts recorded   we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs employees   as of december 28 2003 we employed approximately 10000 employees several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils as of december 28 2003 we employed an aggregate of approximately 2100 union and workers’ council employees we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 9 financial information about reporting segments   the table below sets forth sales and operating profit loss by reporting segment for the 2003 2002 and 2001 fiscal years    our

continuing operations for the 2003 2002 and 2001 fiscal years represents sales based on location of external customer and net property plant and equipment based on physical location     each of our reporting segments conducts business in and derives substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during 2003 we had 8176 million in sales from our international operations representing approximately 53 of our total sales during 2003 we derived approximately 73 of our international sales from our life and analytical sciences reporting segment approximately 24 of our international sales from our optoelectronics reporting segment and approximately 3 of our international sales from our fluid sciences reporting segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future   we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements 11

   we combined our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses to form our life and analytical sciences business in the fourth quarter of 2002 to improve our operational scale which we believe will enable us to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the combined businesses’ sales service and research and development organizations in the second quarter of 2003 we completed many of the changes involved in combining the two businesses including the integration of facilities and management reporting and other systems we have now aggregated the two segments into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes as discrete financial information is now only available on a combined basis for comparative purposes we have disclosed our life and analytical sciences business as one reporting segment for all periods presented   in connection with the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments business units we recorded a 260 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 as a result of workforce reductions facility closures and contract terminations these actions occurred during 2003 with the exception of lease commitment payouts and other spending which we expect to complete in 2004 we achieved in excess of the original range of 12 to 25 million in pretax cost savings in fiscal 2003 from the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses relative to our fiscal 2002 cost levels we are targeting additional pretax cost savings from the combination of between 5 million and 20 million in fiscal 2004 for combined pretax cost savings of between 30 million and 45 million relative to our fiscal 2002 cost levels unforeseen factors may offset some or all of the estimated cost savings or other benefits from the integration as a result our actual cost savings if any could differ or be delayed compared to our estimates consolidated results of continuing operations   sales   2003 compared to 2002 sales for 2003 were 15352 million versus 15050 million during 2002 an increase of 302 million or 2 changes in foreign exchange rates primarily the euro increased sales by approximately 73 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 this increase in sales reflects a 120 million or 1 increase in our life and analytical sciences segment sales which grew from 9917 million in 2002 to 10037 in 2003 and includes approximately 620 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates compared to 2002 our optoelectronics segment sales grew 280 million or 9 from 3238 million in 2002 to 3518 million in 2003 including approximately 100 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates compared to 2002 the increased sales in our life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics segments were offset by a decrease in sales of 98 million or 5 in our fluid sciences segment which declined from 1895 million in 2002 to 1797 million in 2003   2002 compared to 2001 sales for 2002 were 15050 million versus 15253 million during 2001 a decrease of 203 million or 1 changes in foreign exchange rates primarily the euro increased sales by approximately 22 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 this decrease in sales reflects a 564 million or 15 decrease in our optoelectronics segment sales which declined from 3802 million in 2001 to 3238 million in 2002 the decrease in optoelectronics sales in 2002 was primarily due to the absence of sales from our specialty lighting businesses and other discontinued product lines which we divested in 2001 that had accounted for 394 million in sales for 2001 our fluid sciences segment sales declined by 411 million or 18 from 2306 million in 2001 to 1895 million in 2002 the decrease in sales in our optoelectronics and fluid sciences segments were offset in part by an increase in sales of 772 million or 8 in our life and analytical sciences segment which grew from 9145 million in 2001 to 9917 million in 2002 this increase includes approximately 180 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates compared to 2001 also contributing to the increased sales in our life and analytical sciences segment were sales from a full year of packard which we acquired in november 2001 in 2001 we included only two months or 40 million of sales from packard in our results of operations the increase in sales for 2002 in our life and analytical sciences segment was offset in part by our divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2001 of our instruments for research and applied science business which contributed 474 million in sales in 2001 18   cost of sales   2003 compared to 2002 cost of sales for 2003 was 9063 million versus 9041 million for 2002 an increase of 22 million or 02 as a percentage of sales cost of sales decreased to 59 in 2003 from 60 in 2002 resulting in an increase in gross margin of 100 basis points from 40 in 2002 to 41 in 2003 the 100 basis point increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a 2002 172 million inventory adjustment charge recorded within our optoelectronics segment we did not record a similar charge in 2003 apart from this adjustment the gross margin percentages for the life and analytical sciences optoelectronics and fluid sciences reporting segments were substantially unchanged in 2003 as compared to 2002   2002 compared to 2001 cost of sales for 2002 was 9041 million versus 8494 million for 2001 an increase of 547 million or 6 as a percentage of sales cost of sales increased to 60 in 2002 from 56 in 2001 resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 400 basis points from 44 in 2001 to 40 in 2002 of the 400 basis point decrease in gross margin approximately a 350 basis point was due to a decrease in gross margin in our optoelectronics segment resulting primarily from a 2002 172 million inventory adjustment and 150 basis point to a decrease in gross margin in our fluid sciences segment offset in part by a 100 basis point increase in gross margin in our life and analytical sciences segment 

 

   2003 compared to 2002 research and development expenses for 2003 were 831 million versus 865 million in 2002 a decrease of 34 million or 4 as a percentage of sales research and development expenses decreased to 54 in 2003 from 57 in 2002 primarily due to the consolidation of research and development activities to take advantage of increased synergies and corresponding cost savings as a result of fewer sites we directed research and development efforts during 2003 and 2002 primarily toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our life and analytical sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and industrial sensors within our optoelectronics reporting segment we expect our research and development efforts to continue to emphasize the health sciences end markets we expect our research and development spending for fiscal 2004 to remain substantially similar to our historical levels in fiscal 2003 and 2002   2002 compared to 2001 research and development expenses for 2002 were 865 million versus 801 million in 2001 an increase of 64 million or 8 as a percentage of sales research and development expenses increased to 57 in 2002 from 53 in 2001 principally as a result of the inclusion of spending associated with the packard operations we directed research and development efforts during 2002 and 2001 primarily toward drug discovery tools and genetic screening applications as well as biopharmaceutical end markets within our life and analytical sciences reporting segment and biomedical end markets within our optoelectronics reporting segment 

 

   2003 compared to 2002 selling general and administrative expenses for 2003 were 3864 million versus 4313 million for 2002 a decrease of 449 million or 10 as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses decreased 350 basis points to 252 in 2003 from 287 in 2002 proportionately the decrease as a percentage of sales of 350 basis points in 2003 was due to a 200 basis point decrease attributable to reduced expenses in our life and analytical sciences segment a 100 basis point decrease attributable to reduced expenses in our optoelectronics segment and a 50 basis point decrease attributable to reduced expenses in our fluid sciences segment the overall decrease in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to productivity improvements throughout our company including cost savings we derived from restructuring actions   2002 compared to 2001 selling general and administrative expenses for 2002 were 4313 million versus 3769 million for 2001 an increase of 544 million or 14 as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative expenses increased 400 basis points to 287 in 2002 from 247 in 2001 proportionately the increase as a percentage of sales of 400 basis points was due to a 250 basis point increase attributable to increased expenses in our life and analytical sciences segment primarily due to integration costs and an 19 overall decline in sales a 20 basis point increase attributable to increased expenses in our optoelectronics segment and a 130 basis point increase attributable to a decline in sales in our fluid sciences segment 

 

   2003 compared to 2002 restructuring reversals charges net for 2003 was a reversal of 35 million the combination of our 2003 changes in estimate of 58 million and our 2003 charges of 23 million versus a charge of 357 million during 2002 the following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during 2003 2002 and 2001  

 

   during 2003 we incurred a 23 million restructuring charge in our life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics segments which we refer to as our q2 2003 plan the purpose of the restructuring was to further improve performance and take advantage of synergies between our former life sciences and analytical instruments businesses which we began integrating in the fourth quarter of 2002 the principal actions in this restructuring plan included lower headcount due to the continued integration of life and analytical sciences business in a european manufacturing and customer care center as well as headcount reduction at one of the optoelectronics manufacturing facilities to reflect recent declining demand for several product lines we planned to reduce headcount by 120 we recorded restructuring charges by segment for 2003 as follows    this restructuring charge was primarily recorded in the second quarter of 2003 however we recorded additional charges of 05 million and 01 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2003 as required by sfas 146 as some employees who were notified of their employment termination in the second quarter were required to work for a period of time prior to receiving their severance in addition in the fourth quarter of 2003 we recorded a pretax restructuring reversal of 04 million due to 30 fewer employee terminations as a result of higher attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and accordingly lower severance costs   we completed all actions under the q2 2003 plan by december 28 2003 with the exception of nine headcount reductions that we expect to complete by the second quarter of 2004 

 

   in connection with our decision to combine our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 260 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 which we refer to as our q4 2002 plan the q4 2002 plan allowed us to combine many business functions worldwide with the intention to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses’ sales service and research and development organizations the principal actions in the q4 2002 plan included planned workforce reductions of 546 people closure of approximately 20 facilities and disposal of underutilized assets 20   the q4 2002 plan resulted in the integration of our united states life and analytical sciences sales service and customer care centers the integration of european customer care and finance centers the merging of a former life sciences european manufacturing facility with a former analytical instruments european manufacturing facility and the merging of a portion of a former life sciences research and development facility in europe with a former analytical instruments facility in europe   during 2003 we expended 138 million to execute these actions in addition we recorded a reversal of 62 million in the q4 2002 plan due to both higher than expected employee attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and lower severance costs for actual terminations   the remaining liability associated with the q4 2002 plan represents severance related to 65 employees and lease commitments we expect to settle the remaining severance liability by the second quarter of 2004 the lease commitments on unoccupied buildings extend until 2005 

 

   during the first quarter of 2002 our management developed a plan to restructure several businesses we refer to these activities as our q1 2002 plan the plan resulted in pretax restructuring charges totaling 92 million the principal actions in the q1 2002 plan included planned workforce and overhead reductions resulting from reorganization activities including the closure of a manufacturing facility disposal of underutilized assets and general cost reductions   q1 2002 plan charges in our life and analytical sciences segment totaled 55 million these charges comprised 44 million in severance costs 10 million in asset impairments and 1 million in lease commitments the charges were a result of actions we took as a response to decreased sales of components in our life and analytical sciences business these actions under the charges primarily included the downsizing of an additional manufacturing location and streamlining of the global sales and research and development organizations primarily in europe japan and the pacific rim we took these actions to reduce the number of employees in components of our business that had experienced declining demand   q1 2002 plan charges in our optoelectronics segment totaled 37 million comprising 35 million in severance costs and 02 million in asset writeoffs this charge was primarily due to the removal of a layer of management structure within our optoelectronics reporting segment which led to a flatter and less expensive organization structure   total headcount was reduced by 276   during 2003 we recorded a restructuring reversal of 10 million in the q1 2002 plan primarily due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with our optoelectronics segment the remaining 01 million represented lease commitments on a closed facility and will be paid in the first quarter of 2004 

 

   during the fourth quarter of 2001 in connection with the integration of packard and a restructuring of our sales offices in europe we recorded a restructuring charge of 92 million in our life and analytical sciences segment we refer to these activities as our q4 2001 plan the principal actions in the q4 2001 plan included the closing or consolidation of several leased sales and services offices in europe as well as costs associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in europe the closure of leased manufacturing facilities in the united states and the disposal of related assets these actions were designed to streamline the organization and take advantage of the synergies offered by the packard acquisition as they relate to the legacy life and analytical science segment we terminated a total of 272 employees   in 2003 we recorded an additional pretax restructuring charge associated with the q4 2001 plan of 18 million this charge was primarily due to additional severance and severance related benefits of the previously identified employees associated with the closure of our european manufacturing facility in the life and analytical sciences segment and will be paid in 2004 21 

 

   inprocess research and development expenses for 2001 were 715 million and consisted primarily of inprocess research and development expenses related specifically to projects we acquired in our acquisition of packard within our life and analytical sciences reporting segment we determined the value of these projects based on discounted probable future cash flows on a projectbyproject basis we prepared revenue and expense projections as well as technology assumptions through 2008 we discounted the projected cash flows using discount rates specific to each project derived from a cost of capital adjusted upward for the stage of completion these adjusted discount rates ranged between 2037 based upon the remaining effort and risk of completion the efforts required to develop the inprocess technologies into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning designing prototyping verification and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the products could be designed to meet their design specifications including function features and technical performance requirements failure to complete any of these projects has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition   we classified packard acquisition projects for which the charge is associated as follows  

 

   2003 compared to 2002 dispositions resulted in a net gain of 27 million in 2003 versus a net gain of 52 million in 2002 gains on dispositions in 2003 included 22 million from sales of facilities and 05 million from post closing adjustments relating to the resolution of contingencies related to the sale of our instruments for research and applied sciences business which we refer to as iras gains on dispositions in 2002 included 44 million from the sale of facilities and 08 million from post closing entries relating to our sale of our iras business which was formerly part of our life and analytical sciences segment 22   2002 compared to 2001 dispositions resulted in a net gain of 52 million in 2002 versus a net gain of 332 million in 2001 gains on dispositions in 2002 included 44 million from sales of facilities and 08 million from post closing adjustments relating to the sale of our iras business gains on dispositions in 2001 included 323 million from the sale of our iras business and 72 million from dispositions within our optoelectronics and life and analytical sciences reporting segments offset in part by a 63 million loss on the sale of our voltarc technologies business formerly part of our optoelectronics reporting segment 

 

   2003 compared to 2002 amortization of intangible assets was 283 million for both 2003 and 2002 slight increases in the life and analytical sciences segment amortization due to the effect of foreign exchange offset by slight decreases in amortization in the optoelectronics and fluid sciences segments in 2003 compared to 2002   2002 compared to 2001 amortization of intangible assets for 2002 was 283 million versus 439 million for 2001 a decrease of 156 million or 36 the 2001 amortization expense included 271 million related to the amortization of goodwill we discontinued the amortization of goodwill upon adoption of sfas no 142 at the beginning of 2002 the year over year increase in intangible asset amortization was the result of the amortization on intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets that arose from the acquisition of packard 

 

   interest and other expense net consisted of the following    2003 compared to 2002 interest and other expense net for 2003 was 564 million versus 329 million for 2002 an increase of 235 million or 71 the increase in interest and other expense net in 2003 as compared to 2002 was due primarily to higher average borrowing rates resulting from our december 2002 financing a more complete discussion of our liquidity and our prospective costs to borrow can be seen under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” the remaining increase in interest and other expense net of 30 million was due primarily to our increased acceleration of the amortization of debt issuance costs of 19 million resulting from partial prepayments of our term debt during 2003 versus 04 million in 2002 and 06 million of transaction costs we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2003 in connection with amending our credit facility to reduce the interest rate margin applicable to our term loan in january 2004 100 million of our outstanding fixed rate debt was swapped to a floating rate with swap instruments that reset semiannually in arrears based on sixmonth usd libor we expect interest expense in 2004 to decrease due to lower outstanding debt balances lower interest rate margin on our term loan due to the amendment of our credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2003 and the expected benefit derived from our january 2004 swap instruments identified above   2002 compared to 2001 interest and other expense net for 2002 was 329 million versus 292 million for 2001 an increase of 37 million or 13 the increase in interest and other expense net in 2002 as compared to 2001 was due primarily to losses on sales of investments in 2002 as compared to gains in 2001 of 43 million this increase was offset in part by a decline in interest expense to 321 million in 2002 from 377 million in 2001 resulting from decreased levels of indebtedness and lower associated interest rates the 23 04 million in debt extinguishment in 2002 is comprised of 1 32 million in fees and previously capitalized issuance costs writtenoff in connection with our december 2002 debt refinancing transactions 2 a 56 million call premium paid in the first quarter of 2002 upon our extinguishment of the debt we assumed in our acquisition of packard and 3 an offsetting 84 million gain realized on our repurchase of a portion of our zero coupon convertible debentures 

 

   2003 compared to 2002 the 2003 provision for income taxes was 259 million versus a benefit of 44 million in 2002 our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to geographic income patterns our 2003 effective tax rate was 32 as compared to our 2002 effective tax rate of 52 the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a relatively high ratio of permanent tax differences to income loss from continuing operations before income taxes   2002 compared to 2001 the benefit for income taxes for 2002 was 44 million versus a provision of 591 million during 2001 as mentioned above our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to geographic income patterns our 2002 effective tax rate was 52 as compared to our 2001 effective tax rate of 59 the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced profitability in 2002 and inprocess research and development charges associated with our packard acquisition which were not deductible for tax purposes discontinued operations   we recorded the following gains and losses which we report as the loss on dispositions of discontinued operations during the years ended december 28 2003 and december 29 2002    during 2003 we settled various claims under certain longterm contracts and transition services with our technical services business which we sold in august 1999 the net settlement and the reversal of certain previously established contingencies resulted in a pretax gain of 65 million that we recognized in 2003 and included in gain loss on dispositions of discontinued operations   in june 2002 we completed the sale of our security and detection systems business for cash consideration of approximately 1000 million and a net working capital adjustment the amount of which has yet to be finalized we recorded a net pretax gain of approximately 150 million pursuant to this transaction in 2002 as a gain on the disposition of a discontinued operation we accounted for our security and detection systems business as a discontinued operation in accordance with apb no 30 and accordingly the results of operations and related cash flows of this business through the disposal date have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line on our consolidated income statements we present the resulting gain from the sale as a component of net income within dispositions of discontinued operations net of income tax on our 2002 consolidated income statement adjustments relating to this sale resulted in a pretax loss from discontinued operations of 24 million in 2003 primarily due to revised estimates of the working capital adjustment 24   also in june 2002 our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our telecommunications components business and a plan to sell our entertainment lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have reflected both businesses as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements as of june 29 2003 we had exited our entertainment lighting business completing the sale of a substantial portion of that business for cash consideration of 14 million and abandoned the remaining assets sales and losses from discontinued operations for 2003 until that time were 56 million and 16 million respectively as of june 30 2002 we had shut down our telecommunications components business effect of accounting change   as required by sfas 142 we completed the transitional impairment analysis of our recorded goodwill as of january 1 2002 in connection with the adoption of this standard we reviewed our forecasts and projections of all of our reporting units and determined that based on decreased demand for certain specialty lamps resulting from a downturn in the printed circuit board production worldwide and other smaller markets the fair value of the lighting reporting unit was less than its carrying value with the assistance of valuation specialists and using a discounted cash flow model we determined that the carrying value of the recorded goodwill was in excess of the fair value of that goodwill as a result we recorded an impairment charge totaling 1178 million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change the entire transition adjustment related to our lighting reporting unit within our optoelectronics reporting segment in addition as part of our ongoing compliance with sfas no 142 we completed our annual assessment of goodwill using a measurement date of january 1 2003 this annual assessment did not result in an impairment charge acquisitions and divestitures 

 

   in november 2001 we completed our acquisition of packard for a purchase price of approximately 7640 million in exchange for approximately 22 million shares of our common stock and our assumption of approximately 1182 million in debt that we subsequently redeemed in march 2002 the acquisition extended our capabilities in automated liquid handling and sample preparation and strengthened our position as a global provider of comprehensive drug discovery tools and solutions in connection with the packard acquisition we initially recorded approximately 33 million for integration charges the packard integration plans included initiatives to integrate the operations of packard and principally comprise amounts related to employee separation costs for approximately 200 individuals the termination of leases and other contractual obligations and asset writeoffs in connection with these actions in the fourth quarter of 2002 we finalized our estimates of severance costs and determined that our initial estimates were too high principally due to actual severance costs per employee being lower than planned as a result we reversed 119 million of severance costs in the integration accrual in the fourth quarter of 2002 with the offsetting amount recorded to goodwill we also reversed 40 million related to the termination of leases and other contractual obligations in the fourth quarter of 2002 with the offsetting amount recorded to goodwill due to changes in our estimate of our lease obligations the total reversal in the fourth quarter of 2002 was 159 million therefore the net integration charge related to our purchase of packard totaled 171 million the integration activities were completed in early 2003 with the exception of 09 million in remaining payments due on leased facilities exited in 2001 that will be paid through 2004 these integration activities are linked to the q4 2001 plan and are disclosed in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 25   the following table summarizes integration reserve activity during 2003 2002 and 2001 related to the acquisition of packard    in july 2000 we completed our acquisition of nen life sciences inc a provider of drug discovery products services reagents and technologies to the life sciences industry we recorded a 40 million integration reserve related to the acquisition of nen the nen restructuring plan included approximately 38 million in termination and employment related costs of individuals principally based in nen’s headquarters and operations center and 2 million of lease termination costs 34 million of the termination and employment related costs remained as of the end of fiscal 2000 the integration activities occurred concurrently with our restructuring activities of 2000 the following table summarizes integration reserve activity during 2001 related to the acquisition of nen    in may 1999 we completed our acquisition of the analytical instruments division of pe corp for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 425 million as part of the analytical instruments acquisition we incurred integration charges to merge the analytical instruments business with our existing business the analytical instruments integration plan included initiatives to integrate the operations of the acquired businesses and reduce overhead the primary components of these plans related to 1 employee termination benefits and related costs for approximately 600 individuals 2 consolidation or shutdown of certain operational facilities worldwide and 3 termination of certain leases and other contractual obligations the integration activities were completed in 2002 26   the following table summarizes integration reserve activity during 2002 and 2001 related to our acquisition of analytical instruments  contingencies   we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 62 million as of december 28 2003 representing our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations while it is possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred we do not expect the potential exposure to be materially different from the amounts we recorded   we and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs have alleged various statements made by us were misleading with respect to our prospects and future operating results we believe we have meritorious defenses to the lawsuits and we intend to contest the actions vigorously we are currently unable however to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss if any that may result from the resolution of these matters   we have received a notice from the internal revenue service asserting federal income tax deficiencies for 1997 and 1998 we are challenging many of the proposed adjustments we believe that the ultimate outcome of the notices will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position reporting segment results of continuing operations 

 

   2003 compared to 2002 sales for 2003 were 10037 million versus 9917 million in 2002 an increase of 120 million or 1 changes in foreign exchange rates primarily the euro increased sales by approximately 61 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 the favorable effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations was offset in part by reduced unit sales volume the following analysis compares selected sales by 27 market and product type for 2003 as compared to 2002 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers increased 227 million sales to genetic screening customers increased 63 million and our onesource tm laboratory service sales increased by 148 million these increases were offset by a 318 million decrease in sales to biopharmaceutical customers primarily in sales of liquid handling instruments and radiochemical reagents as general biopharmaceutical market demand remained weak throughout 2003 sales by type of product included increases in sales of consumables of 235 million and service of 148 million partially offset by decreases in sales of instruments of 263 million 

  operating profit for 2003 was 947 million versus 274 million in 2002 an increase of 673 million the increase in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily the result of approximately 430 million of overall cost savings in 2003 associated with restructuring and integration activities mainly due to a reduction in the number of employees and the elimination of excess facilities the increase in operating profit in 2003 as compared to 2002 was also due to approximately 315 million of net restructuring charges included in our results for 2002 compared to a net restructuring credit of 19 million in 2003 amortization of intangibles was 260 million for the year ended december 28 2003 versus 255 million for the year ended december 29 2002   2002 compared to 2001 sales for 2002 were 9917 million versus 9145 million in 2001 an increase of 772 million or 8 the increase in sales in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily because our results for 2002 included a full year of results from packard which we acquired in november 2001 and our results for 2001 included only two months or 40 million of results from packard sales by packard for the first ten months of 2001 prior to acquisition were approximately 165 million partially offsetting the effects in 2002 of including the results of packard was the absence of results in 2002 from our iras business which we divested in the fourth quarter of 2001 sales from that business were 474 million in 2001 changes in foreign exchange rates primarily the euro increased sales by approximately 18 million in 2002 compared to 2001 the following analysis compares selected sales by market and product type for 2002 as compared to 2001 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations sales to biopharmaceutical customers increased 994 million due to the full year impact of the packard acquisition service sales increased by 336 million and sales to genetic screening customers increased 85 million these increases were offset in part by a 169 million decrease in sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers and our iras divestiture sales by type of product included increases in sales of consumables of 401 million service of 336 million and instruments of 509 million all partially offset by the absence of sales from our divested iras business sales of our iras business in 2001 were 474 million   operating profit for 2002 was 274 million versus 314 million in 2001 a decrease of 40 million or 13 items contributing to this decrease in operating profit included restructuring charges in 2002 which were 315 million versus 87 million in 2001 and gains from dispositions of businesses which were only 52 million in 2002 versus 321 million in 2001 increases in operating profit year over year included charges primarily related to the integration and reorganization of packard which decreased from 278 million in 2001 to 48 million in 2002 operating profit for 2001 also included a 690 million charge associated with acquired inprocess research and development associated with our acquisition of packard the favorable impact on operating profit in 2002 from additional sales volume was more than offset by the inclusion of additional costs related to packard for the full year goodwill and intangible asset amortization expenses were 256 million for 2002 and 342 million for 2001 

 

   2003 compared to 2002 sales for 2003 were 3518 million versus 3238 million for 2002 an increase of 280 million or 9 changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately 100 million or 3 the following analysis compares selected sales by product line for 2003 as compared to 2002 and includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates sales of specialty lighting products increased by 202 million due to growth in sales of flash products and sales of digital imaging products increased by 177 million due to increased sales of diagnostic and radiotherapy digital xray detector products these 28 increases were offset in part by sales decreases totaling 99 million in our sensors lithography and fiber optic test product lines due to limited demand in these end markets 

  operating profit for 2003 was 422 million versus an operating loss of 40 million for 2002 an increase of 462 million the operating loss for 2002 includes a charge of 172 million for an inventory write down which was not repeated in 2003 2003 included a net restructuring reversal of 18 million compared to a net restructuring charge of 37 million in 2002 increased sales and productivity improvements including improved manufacturing performance and reduced operating expenses and a headcount reduction of more than 200 contributed a total of approximately 200 million in additional operating profit in 2003 compared to 2002 amortization of intangible assets was 12 million for 2003 and 13 million for 2002   2002 compared to 2001 sales for 2002 were 3238 million versus 3802 million for 2001 a decrease of 564 million or 15 the decrease in sales in 2002 was primarily due to the absence of sales from divested specialty lighting businesses and product lines which accounted for 394 million in sales for 2001 changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately 30 million or 1 the following analysis compares selected sales by product line for 2002 as compared to 2001 and includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rate fluctuations sales of digital imaging products increased by 302 million due primarily to increased sales of digital xray detector products sales of sensor products decreased by 123 million and sales within our fiber optic test and lithography businesses decreased 356 million as a result of weak market demand sales decreased by 387 million in our specialty lighting products business mainly due to the previously referenced divested businesses and product lines   operating loss for 2002 was 40 million versus an operating profit of 513 million for 2001 a decrease of 553 million the decrease in 2002 operating profit was primarily the result of lower sales the inclusion in 2002 of an inventory write down of 172 million and a restructuring charge of 37 million goodwill and intangible asset amortization was 13 million for 2002 and 70 million for 2001

   operating activities net cash generated by continuing operations was 1604 million in 2003 contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2003 was net income from continuing operations of 550 million and a decrease in working capital accounts of 722 million contributing to the decrease in working capital in 2003 were reductions in accounts receivable of 434 million and inventory of 282 million in general accounts receivable and inventory levels declined due to our focus on customer payment terms as well as enhanced inventory management accounts receivable also decreased as a result of increased use of our accounts receivable securitization facility which increased 16 million from 29 million at december 29 2002 to 45 million at december 28 2003 cash outlays for accrued expenses restructuring and other assets and liabilities totaled 519 million during 2003 primarily as a result of payments toward restructuring plans and other obligations we expect our restructuring expenditures to be reduced in 2004   investing activities in 2003 we withdrew 1875 million of cash held in escrow to retire substantially all of our remaining outstanding indebtedness under our zero coupon convertible debentures in 2003 we made capital expenditures of 166 million mainly in the areas of tooling and productivity improvements along with system and facility costs related to integration activities net proceeds from the dispositions of businesses and fixed assets during 2003 were 44 million we derived 33 million of these proceeds from the sale of a building made redundant due to integration activities in 2004 we expect to incur approximately 40 million in capital expenditures   financing activities in 2003 we used 2984 million of net cash for financing activities we expended 1875 million of cash withdrawn from our designated escrow account along with approximately 24 million of available cash to redeem our outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures debt reductions during 2003 also included 700 million of cash used to repay a portion of our term loan in december 2003 we amended our credit facility to among other things reduce the interest rate applicable to our term loan we paid 30 44 million in transaction fees during 2003 in connection with that amendment we also paid 354 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 36 million in 2003 

 

   operating activities net cash generated by continuing operations was 1145 million in 2002 contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2002 was a decrease in working capital of 974 million the working capital decrease during 2002 reflects improved working capital management as well as a 172 million inventory adjustment within our optoelectronics reporting segment offset in part by a net decrease of 80 million in proceeds from our receivable securitization program we decreased inventory levels by 482 million during 2002 including a 172 million optoelectronics inventory adjustment on lower sales volume cash outlays for accrued expenses restructuring and other assets and liabilities totaled 492 million during 2002 primarily as a result of payments toward restructuring plans and the settlement of payroll professional fees hedging and other obligations   investing activities in 2002 our investing activities used 1508 million of cash including placing 1865 million of cash in escrow for the purpose of retiring some of our outstanding indebtedness under our zero coupon convertible debentures we made capital expenditures of 378 million mainly in the areas of tooling and process improvement for our drug discovery tools business and other products for biopharmaceutical applications we also expended 300 million in the settlement of a lease obligation on our fremont california facility resulting in our purchase of this facility net proceeds from the dispositions of businesses and fixed assets during 2002 of 1260 million were primarily from approximately 962 million in net proceeds received from the sale of our security and detection systems business during the second quarter of 2002 and approximately 298 million associated with the sale of facilities cash outflows of 225 million associated with acquisitions related primarily to the settlement of liabilities incurred in connection with the packard acquisition   financing activities in 2002 we generated 245 million of net cash from financing activities our gross debt levels increased by 814 million to 8055 million at december 29 2002 included in this amount was 1865 million of our outstanding indebtedness under the zero coupon convertible debentures which were not tendered by holders as part of our 2002 refinancing transactions for which we had 1865 million of cash held in escrow at december 29 2002 for the purpose of retiring the untendered indebtedness reductions in debt included 1103 million of 68 notes due in 2005 and 3043 million of zero coupon convertible debentures both of which we repurchased as part of our 2002 debt refinancing transactions debt reductions in 2002 also included 1182 million of 9375 senior subordinated tenyear notes issued by packard in march 1997 which we repurchased at a rate of 104688 and 55 million in other credit facilities we paid down during 2002 offsetting these reductions was our december 2002 issuance of senior subordinated notes which generated proceeds of 2975 million and our establishment of a term loan which generated proceeds of 3150 million in connection with these debt issuances and terminations we paid 158 million in fees during 2002 we also paid 353 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 129 million in 2002 borrowing arrangements   senior secured credit facility in december 2002 we entered into a senior credit facility this facility is comprised of a sixyear term loan in the amount of 3150 million and a 1000 million fiveyear revolving credit facility in 2003 we made 70 million of principal payments on the term loan accordingly at december 28 2003 we had 245 million outstanding under our term loan with no outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility at december 28 2003 or at any other time during the year this credit facility is secured primarily by a portion of our subsidiaries domestic assets   in april 2003 we amended our senior credit facility to 1 allow for the sale of our entertainment lighting business under the final negotiated terms of that sale and 2 to ensure conformity between the credit agreement governing the facility and the financial covenants negotiated with the lead arranger merrill lynch the amendment corrected a drafting error in the definition of consolidated interest expense under the initial 31 agreement consolidated interest expense was erroneously defined as being calculated using pro forma annualized interest expense beginning in the first quarter of 2003 compared to the intended calculation using a rolling quarter methodology as originally agreed the definition of consolidated interest expense under the amended agreement was changed to properly state the calculation as a rolling fourquarter methodology 

  in december 2003 we amended our senior credit facility to reduce the margin paid on the term loan as well as to amend several restrictive covenants interest rates under the senior credit facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit facility are determined as a margin over either the eurodollar rate or the base rate the base rate is the higher of 1 the corporate base rate announced from time to time by bank of america na and 2 the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points   the applicable margin for the term loan was amended to 225 basis points for the eurodollar rate from the original 400 basis points and to 125 basis points for the base rate from the original 300 basis points the applicable margins for the term loan and the revolving credit facility vary based upon our leverage ratio at the end of the prior quarter   we may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based upon the margin over the eurodollar rate or the base rate at december 28 2003 the eurodollar rate was approximately 114 basis points and the base rate was 400 basis points resulting in an eurodollar interest rate on the senior credit facility of 339 basis points   the term loan is repayable in mandatory nominal quarterly installments of 08 million of the outstanding balance until december 2007 and thereafter in four equal quarterly installments of 25 of the then outstanding balance until december 2008 additionally annual payments of 50 of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement are payable six months following the end of each fiscal year in 2003 we made 70 million in principal payments on the term loan the revolving credit facility is available to us through december 2007 for our working capital needs at no point in fiscal 2003 did we have any outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility   our senior credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specific financial ratios including    as of december 28 2003 and at all other times during fiscal 2003 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants   8 78 notes in december 2002 we issued and sold tenyear senior subordinated notes at a rate of 8 78 with a face value of 3000 million we received 2975 million in gross proceeds from the issuance we recorded deferred issuance costs of 70 million as a noncurrent asset the debt which matures in january 2013 is unsecured but is guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries interest on our 8 78 notes is payable semiannually on january 15 and july 15 interest payments began on july 15 2003 in january 2004 we swapped the fixed rate on 100 million of these notes to a floating rate using swap instruments which reset semiannually in arrears based upon sixmonth usd libor if a change of control occurs each holder of 8 78 notes may require us to repurchase some or all of its notes at a purchase price equal to 101 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest before january 15 2006 we may redeem up to 35 of the aggregate principal amount of our 8 78 notes with the net proceeds of specified public equity offerings at 108875 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest if at least 65 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding after the redemption we may redeem some or all of our 8 78 notes at any time on or after january 15 2008 at a redemption price of 104438 the redemption price decreases to 102958 on january 15 2009 to 101479 on january 15 2010 and to 100 on january 15 2011 the debt is subordinated to our senior credit facility our 8 78 notes contain financial and other covenants most of these covenants terminate if the notes obtain an investment grade rating by 32 standard  poor’s rating services and moody’s investors service at december 28 2003 and at all times during fiscal 2003 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 

  zero coupon convertible debentures through the first quarter of 2003 we repurchased 3447 million in accreted amount of our zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 in open market purchases and through a december 2002 tender offer we redeemed the remaining 1574 million of accreted value of zero coupon debentures on august 7 2003 in accordance with their terms we used approximately 1550 million held in escrow pursuant to the terms of our senior secured credit facility along with available cash of approximately 24 million to redeem the zero coupon convertible debentures as of december 28 2003 the zero coupon convertible debentures have been fully retired   68 notes in december 2002 we initiated a tender offer for all of our outstanding 68 notes we completed the tender offer and repurchased all but 47 million of these notes as of december 26 2002 we paid consent payments pursuant to a consent solicitation we made concurrently with the tender offer the consent solicitation eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our 68 notes as of december 29 2002 we may from time to time repurchase outstanding 68 notes through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise these notes are due to be paid in 2005 offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

   in december 2001 we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to purchase on a revolving basis certain of our accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution in september 2003 we amended the facility to increase total funding capacity from 50 million to 65 million to expand our sources of liquidity amounts funded under this facility were 450 million at december 28 2003 and 290 million at december 29 2002 as of december 28 2003 we had approximately 20 million of undrawn capacity available under the facility the facility had an effective interest rate of approximately libor plus 120 basis points as of december 28 2003 the facility includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of bb or above as defined by standard  poor’s rating services and ba2 or above as defined by moody’s investors service at december 28 2003 we had a senior unsecured credit rating of bb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s rating services and of ba2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service in january 2004 we entered into an agreement to extend the term of our accounts receivable securitization facility to january 28 2005 as well as reduce the underlying cost of the facility cost reductions in the new agreement would result in an effective interest rate of approximately libor plus 90 basis points based on the drawn balance of 45 million as of december 28 2003 we expect to renew this facility again in january 2005 as it currently provides us a vehicle to accelerate the cash collection of customer receivables dividends   our board of directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2003 and 2002 resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per share our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding 8 78 senior subordinated notes contain restrictions that may limit our ability to pay our regular quarterly cash dividend in the future 33 contractual obligations   the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 28 2003    during 2004 we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately 40 million primarily to introduce new products to improve operating processes to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations and to reflect investments in information technology we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures new accounting pronouncements   in january and december 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 and no 46 revised fin 46r consolidation of variable interest entities  these statements which address accounting for entities commonly known as specialpurpose or offbalancesheet entities require consolidation of certain interests or arrangements by virtue of holding a controlling financial interest in such entities certain provisions of fin 46r related to interests in special purpose entities were applicable for the period ended december 31 2003 we must apply fin 46r to our interests in all entities subject to the interpretation as of the first interim or annual period ending after march 15 2004 we have considered the application of fin 46 and fin46r to our investments receivables securitization program and other business relationships and concluded that the adoption of this new method of accounting for variable interest entities did not and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position application of critical accounting policies and estimates   the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories intangible assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements   revenue recognition we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured for products that include installation if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element product revenue is recognized upon delivery and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete for sales that include customerspecified acceptance criteria revenue is recognized only after the acceptance criteria have been met revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the 34 contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer when arrangements include multiple elements we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element all in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates further we have not experienced any significant product returns or refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

  allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by 1 applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and 2 specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings   inventory valuation we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase andor manufacture we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and when necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated inventory previously written down may be sold resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period   value of longlived assets including intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review 1 on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets and 2 on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings the 2002 initial assessment of goodwill recoverability under sfas no 142 resulted in a 1178 million charge to our earnings this charge relating to goodwill in our lighting reporting unit within our optoelectronics business segment was caused by expected declines in profitability and cash flows as a result of softness in key endmarkets we completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill for 2003 and concluded that there was no impairment while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets in addition we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not being amortized at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life if events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas 142 these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization   employee compensation and benefits retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected longterm rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year as of december 28 2003 we estimated the expected longterm 35 rate of return in the united states was 85 percent and ranged from 25 to 75 percent for our plans outside the united states we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets our management will continue to assess the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate discount rate assumptions were based on the prevailing market longterm interest rates at the measurement date if any of our assumptions were to change our pension plan expenses would also change a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase pretax pension expense by 22 million for 2004 in the united states and by 06 million for 2004 for all plans outside the united states retirement and post retirement benefit plan expense is allocated to cost of sales research and development and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations we incurred expenses of 62 million in 2003 39 million in 2002 and 24 million in 2001 for our retirement and post retirement plans we expect expenses of approximately 84 million in 2004 for our retirement and post retirement plans we have reduced the volatility in our health care costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature under the defined dollar plan feature our total annual liability for health care costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount regardless of the nature or cost of the health care needs of that retiree our future liability therefore cannot be impacted by future changes in the cost of health care 

  restructuring activities our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of 1 severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades 2 costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of subrental income and 3 asset impairments as discussed above under “value of longlived assets including intangibles” because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention for example actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected in addition unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled “restructuring charges net”   gains or losses on dispositions when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated during the year ended december 28 2003 we recognized 16 million in losses from the dispositions of divested businesses classified as discontinued operations and 27 million in gains from the disposition of assets comprised largely of excess facilities the 16 million included additional losses from the final disposition of our telecommunications components and entertainment lighting businesses as well as working capital adjustments related to the sale of our security and detection business these losses were offset by gains from the resolution of contingencies associated with the 1999 divestiture of the technical services business any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the “gains on disposition” or “discontinued operations” line items appearing in our income statement   income taxes our business operations are global in nature and we are subject to taxes in more than 40 countries tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law our tax provision contemplates tax rates in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax position any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of 36 taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 

  in addition we have established valuation allowances against a variety of tax attributes including net operation loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and other credits valuation allowances take into consideration among other things limitations imposed upon the use of the tax attributes and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed to be recoverable improvements or other changes in our operations domestically and internationally could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

 

   financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december 28 2003   in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs for the year ended december 28 2003 we did not engage in hedges designated as cash flow the notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately 1685 million at december 28 2003 and 1030 million as of december 29 2002 and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts designated as fair value hedges was insignificant the duration of the foreign currency derivative contracts is generally 30 day for 2003 

 

   market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures   foreign exchange risk as a multinational corporation we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates these exposures can take a variety of different forms  37    we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations the derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes we specifically use forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and use a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies the success of our hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses the principal currencies hedged are the british pound canadian dollar euro japanese yen and singapore dollar in those currencies where there is a liquid costeffective forward market we maintain hedge coverage between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure   foreign currency risk — valueatrisk disclosure  — we utilize a valueatrisk model to determine the potential earningfair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program our valueatrisk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days as of december 28 2003 this computation estimated that there is a 5 chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 01 million this valueatrisk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during each of the four quarters of fiscal 2003 the valueatrisk ranged between 01 million and 10 million and averaged approximately 05 million   interest rate risk as described above our debt portfolio includes both fixed rate and variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings in january 2004 we initiated for a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio interest rate swaps that in effect convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt these swaps have been designated as fair value hedges these swaps will be marked to market in our consolidated financial statements so that fair value movements in these swaps will be offset by the fair value movement in the debt   interest rate risk — sensitivity  — as of december 28 2003 our debt portfolio is comprised of 55 fixed rate debt and 45 variable rate debt after giving effect to the interest rate swap entered into in january 2004 37 of our debt portfolio is fixed and 63 is variable our current debt covenants require that we 38 maintain at least 30 of our debt portfolio in fixed rate debt as defined in the credit agreement our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows 

 forwardlooking information and factors affecting future performance   the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

 

   some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical industry downturns are often characterized by reduced product demand excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling prices and profits significant downturns in our customers’ markets and in general economic conditions have resulted in a reduced demand for several of our products and have hurt our operating results for example during 2003 our operating results were adversely affected by downturns in many of the markets we serve including the pharmaceutical biomedical semiconductor and aerospace markets current economic conditions have caused a decrease in capital spending by many of our customers which in turn has adversely affected our sales and business 

 

   we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products could become technologically obsolete over time in which case our sales and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to    many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products therefore we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales 39   in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications for example some of our license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research and exclude clinical diagnostics applications 

 

   as of december 28 2003 we had approximately 5495 million in outstanding indebtedness excluding obligations under our accounts receivable securitization facility   our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay the principal or interest in respect of our indebtedness we have 1000 million in additional borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility we may also obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage   our leverage could have negative consequences including    a significant portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates as a result our interest payment obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase   our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy if we are unable to service our debt and fund our business we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures seek additional financing or equity capital restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all 

 

   our senior credit facility and the indenture relating to our 8 78 notes contain and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to  40    we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition   our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under our senior credit facility would trigger an event of default under our 8 78 notes and a default under our 8 78 notes would trigger an event of default under the senior credit facility and possibly other debt   if an event of default occurs we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under our indebtedness if we are unable to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility those lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings under that agreement our inability to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility may also cause a default under other of our obligations including our accounts receivable securitization facility 

 

   because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented more than 50 of our total sales in the fiscal year ended december 28 2003 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including  41 

 

   given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we can offer no assurance of our ability to make such adjustments or to make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include  

 

   we have in the past and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our acquisition of packard bioscience company in november 2001 we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons including    some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations   to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us 42 

 

   in 2003 we achieved in excess of the original range of 12 to 25 million in pretax cost savings from the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses announced in the fourth quarter of 2002 in 2004 we are targeting additional pretax cost savings of between 50 million and 200 million for a combined pretax cost savings of between 300 million and 450 million relative to fiscal 2002 cost levels while we believe these cost savings to be reasonable they are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict are necessarily speculative in nature and are subject to various integration risks the integration risks include the possibility that we may experience a loss of productivity sales and key personnel and that the information technology systems of these two businesses may not be fully compatible if any of the potential difficulties were to occur and persist the business results of our life and analytical sciences reporting segment could suffer in addition unforeseen factors may offset some or all of the estimated cost savings or other benefits from the integration   as a result of these integration risks and possible unforeseen factors our actual cost savings if any could differ or be delayed compared to our estimates moreover our capability to more fully capitalize through their combination on the strengths of our former life sciences and analytical instruments businesses’ sales service and research and development organizations may be compromised 

 

   we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share   our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 

 

   we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 

 

   some of the products produced by our life and analytical sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar international agencies in addition some of the activities of our fluid sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the united states federal aviation administration these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales resales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 43 

 

   we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 

 

   patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing and marketing new technologies and products is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents to cover our products we may not obtain issued patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology 

 

   in addition to our patents we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties the measures that we employ to protect this technology and these rights may not be adequate moreover in some cases the licensor can terminate a license or convert it to a nonexclusive arrangement if we fail to meet specified performance targets   we may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties in addition claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or abroad 

 

   as of december 28 2003 our total assets included 15 billion of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization these assets have historically been amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives in connection with our adoption of sfas no 142 we discontinued the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets beginning in fiscal 2002 instead we test these items at a minimum on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned   future impairment testing may result in additional intangible asset writeoffs which could adversely affect our results of operations 44

developments   as part of our efforts to refocus our company on our core businesses we have recently taken the following measures   life and analytical sciences in october 2002 we formed our life and analytical sciences business unit by combining our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses   security and detection systems business in june 2002 we completed the sale of our security and detection systems business to l3 communications we received cash proceeds in this transaction of approximately 1000 million these proceeds are subject to a working capital adjustment which we do not expect to be material we have reflected this business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10k   telecommunications component and entertainment lighting businesses in june 2002 our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our telecommunications component business and a plan to sell our entertainment lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have reflected these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on form 10k   packard bioscience in november 2001 we completed our acquisition of packard bioscience company for consideration of approximately 7640 million primarily in the form of approximately 22 million shares of our common stock and our assumption of 1182 million in debt the acquisition extended our capabilities in automated liquid handling and sample preparation and strengthened our position as a global provider of comprehensive drug discovery solutions 1   fluid sciences in october 2001 our board of directors approved a plan to sell our fluid sciences business unit at which time we reflected the business as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 30 “reporting the results of operations — reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” due to external market conditions we did not complete the sale of this business within the oneyear time period afforded by apb no 30 our consolidated results from continuing operations therefore again reflect our fluid sciences business unit for all periods presented in this report   nen life sciences in july 2000 we completed our acquisition of nen life sciences inc a provider of stateoftheart drug discovery products services reagents and technologies to the life sciences industry we purchased nen life sciences for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 4180 million in connection with the acquisition we paid approximately 3500 million in cash and issued warrants to purchase approximately 600000 shares of our common stock in addition we repaid approximately 500 million of outstanding indebtedness of nen life sciences life and analytical sciences   we are a leading provider of drug discovery genetic screening and chemical analysis tools and instrumentation our instruments are used in daily applications for scientific research and clinical applications our research products provide the fundamental tools necessary for a variety of testing applications that are critical to the development of many of our customers’ product pipelines   we formed our life and analytical sciences business unit in october 2002 by combining our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses for the year ended december 29 2002 the life sciences and analytical instruments reporting segments together generated sales of 9917 million   we combined our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses to improve our operational scale which we believe will enable us to better serve our customers and to more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses’ sales service and research and development organizations we expect that this new integrated business will allow us to provide a single point of contact to our customers and to promote our sales efforts to senior levels of their organizations we believe that these senior decision makers are positioned to expand the range of products and services their organizations purchase from us we are targeting annualized cost savings from the combination of these businesses of between 300 million and 450 million the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses will require changes to our organizational structure processes and systems over the next year because we anticipate that the benefits of the combination of these businesses will not be fully realized until 2004 we are targeting cost savings of between 120 million and 250 million in 2003 we cannot assure you that we will achieve any of these cost savings

marketing   all of our businesses market their products and services through their own specialized sales forces as well as independent foreign and domestic manufacturer’s representatives distributors and agents our businesses sometimes enter into joint venture and license agreements with local firms in foreign countries to manufacture and market their products as of december 29 2002 we had approximately 2500 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 45 countries and marketing products in approximately 125 countries raw materials and supplies   each of our reporting segments use raw materials and supplies that are generally readily available in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources we typically do not have longterm contracts with any of our suppliers in some cases we may rely on a single supplier for particular items although we believe that we could obtain these items from alternative suppliers if necessary intellectual property   we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and abroad we also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances in addition to our patent portfolio we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow we also own numerous united states and foreign trademarks registered trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the united states and abroad we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of each of our reporting segments but we also rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of each of our reporting segments we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a materially adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments   in some cases we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement to enforce our or our licensors’ patents to protect our trade secrets knowhow or other intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources an adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a commercial product or require us to license the disputed property from third parties we are currently one of several parties defending a litigation brought by enzo biochem inc and enzo life sciences inc alleging that we breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with the plaintiffs infringed the plaintiffs’ patents engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against the plaintiffs by among other things engaging in commercial development and 7 exploitation of the plaintiffs’ patented products and technology separately and together with the other defendants see “item 3 legal proceedings” for a discussion of this

backlog   we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business units due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business competition   because of the wide range of our products and services we face many different types of competition and competitors this affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations that produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do to small concerns producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments   in our life sciences reporting segment we compete on the basis of service level price product availability and reliability competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well established market niches we compete in these markets on the basis of innovative technologies product differentiation and quality we expect the proportion of large competitors in this reporting segment to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors   no single competitor competes directly with our analytical instruments reporting segment as a whole we compete with instrument companies that serve particular segments of markets in industrial instrumentation we compete in this segment primarily on the basis of product performance product reliability service and price   no single competitor competes directly with our optoelectronics reporting segment across its full product range however we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the products and sale of specialty flashtubes and ultraspecialty lighting sources photodetectors and photodiodes and switched power supplies competition is based on price technological innovation operational efficiency and product reliability and quality   competition in our fluid sciences reporting segment is typically based on product performance and innovation quality service and price in a few markets competitors are large diversified engineering and manufacturing concerns most of our competitors however are small specialized manufacturing companies offering limited product lines for narrow market segments competition for lubricant testing services is primarily from one large nonprofit institute and some customerowned laboratories and is mainly based on quality and price   we believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our reporting segments experience competition research and development   perkinelmersponsored research and development expenditures were approximately 865 million during 2002 approximately 801 million during 2001 and approximately 761 million during 2000   we directed our research and development efforts in both 2002 and 2001 primarily in the drug discovery tools and genetic screening applications markets as well as the biopharmaceutical markets within our life sciences and analytical instruments reporting segments and in the biomedical markets within our optoelectronics reporting segment environmental matters   our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations these requirements include those governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances 8 the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees 

  we may have liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various thirdparty sites we have incurred and will continue to incur costs pursuant to these statutes   we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party for specific waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period in which our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 71 million as of december 29 2002 representing management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we are named a potentially responsible party management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site we review these liabilities and adjust them to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows while it is possible that we may incur a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different than the amounts recorded   in connection with our acquisitions we may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs employees   as of december 29 2002 we employed approximately 10700 employees in our continuing operations several of our subsidiaries with an aggregate of approximately 1400 employees as of december 29 2002 are parties to contracts with labor unions we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory financial information about reporting segments   the table below sets forth sales and operating profit loss by reporting segment for 2002 for 2001 and for 2000  9    our security and detection systems telecommunications component and entertainment lighting businesses are discontinued operations and therefore have not been included in the preceding table the results for the periods presented above include certain acquisition charges restructuring charges and other items which are discussed in this annual report on form 10k under the heading “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”   additional information relating to our reporting segments is as follows   10 financial information about geographic areas   the following geographic area information for continuing operations includes sales based on location of external customer and net property plant and equipment based on physical location     each of our reporting segments conducts business in and derives substantial revenue from various countries outside the united states during 2002 we had 7824 million in sales from our international operations representing approximately 52 of our total sales during 2002 we derived approximately 44 of our international sales from our analytical instruments reporting segment approximately 32 of our international sales from our life sciences reporting segment approximately 20 of our international sales from our optoelectronics reporting segment and approximately 4 of our international sales from our fluid sciences reporting segment we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales   we are exposed to the risks associated with international operations including exchange rate fluctuations regional and countryspecific political and economic conditions foreign receivables collection concerns trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements tax risks staffing and labor law concerns intellectual property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements 11

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following management discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking information that you should read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements that we have included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k actual results may differ materially from the plans intentions or expectations we disclose in the forwardlooking statements we make we have included important factors below under the heading “forwardlooking information and factors affecting future performance” that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements we make overview   we are a leading provider of scientific instruments consumables and services to the pharmaceutical biomedical environmental testing and general industrial markets we design manufacture market and service products and systems within three business units  

 

   during the fourth quarter of 2002 we combined our life sciences and analytical instruments business units into a new integrated business named life and analytical sciences we combined our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses to improve our operational scale which we believe will enable us to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses’ sales service and research and development organizations our life and analytical sciences business unit comprised two reporting segments for the years presented in this annual report on form 10k in connection with the formation of our life and analytical sciences business unit and expected nearterm pressure on capital expenditures within certain key end markets we recorded a 260 million restructuring charge as a result of workforce reductions facility closures and contract terminations that we expect to make we expect many of these actions to occur during 2003 the combination of these businesses will require changes to our organizational structure processes and systems over the next year we are targeting annualized pretax cost savings from the combination of between 300 million and 450 million beginning in 2004 with interim pretax cost savings of between 120 million and 250 million in 2003 we cannot assure you that we will achieve any of these cost savings 18

   2002 compared to 2001 other expense net for 2002 was 329 million versus 292 million for 2001 an increase of 37 million or 13 the increase in other expense net was due primarily to 87 million in premiums fees and writeoffs of unamortized costs resulting from the early extinguishment of debt during 2002 25 million in transaction costs incurred as part of the proposed sale of the fluid sciences business a 20 million loss on an equity investment versus net gains of 43 million in 2001 and other items totaling 41 million offsetting these amounts were 84 million in gains realized on the repurchase of a portion of the zero coupon convertible debentures a year over year decline in net interest expense of 51 million and a 44 million gain realized on the termination of a fixed to variable interest rate swap as a result of the tender offer for our 68 notes the 87 million in charges associated with the early extinguishment of debt were comprised of a 55 million call premium paid on the extinguishment of the packard debt called in the first quarter of 2002 and 32 million in fees and previously capitalized issuance costs writtenoff in connection with our december 2002 debt refinancing transactions a decline in interest expense to 321 million in 2002 from 377 million in 2001 was the result of decreased levels of indebtedness and lower associated interest rates period over period we expect interest expense in 2003 to increase due to the debt we raised as part of our 2002 debt refinancing transactions 23   2001 compared to 2000 other expense net for 2001 was 292 million versus 331 million in 2000 a decrease of 39 million or 12 other expense net for 2001 included gains realized on the sale of investments of 43 million the results from 2000 included similar gains of 09 million interest expense for 2001 of 377 million versus 374 million in 2000 was the result of higher debt levels due to acquisition activity offset by lower borrowing costs the remaining impact in each of the years was attributable to foreign exchange losses 

 

   2002 compared to 2001 the benefit for income taxes for 2002 was 44 million versus a provision of 591 million during 2001 our 2002 effective tax rate of 52 is primarily attributable to the geographic income patterns reduced profitability permanent tax differences and use of foreign tax credits in the united states our 2001 effective tax rate of 59 was increased by the tax treatment of inprocess research and development charges associated with our packard acquisition which were not deductible for tax purposes absent these items we would expect our effective tax rate to approximate 35   2001 compared to 2000 the provision for income taxes was 591 million in 2001 versus 564 million in 2000 our 2001 tax rate was increased by the tax treatment of inprocess research and development charges associated with the packard acquisition which were not deductible for tax purposes our 2000 effective tax rate of 38 was impacted to a lesser extent by similar inprocess research and development charges discontinued operations   in june 2002 we sold our security and detection systems business to l3 communications we received cash proceeds in this transaction of approximately 1000 million at closing the proceeds are subject to a working capital adjustment which we do not expect to be material we have reflected the business and the associated impact of the disposition as a discontinued operation within our consolidated financial statements in accordance with apb no 30 for the portion of 2002 prior to being sold our security and detection systems business had sales of 1082 million   also in june 2002 our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our telecommunications component business and a plan to sell our entertainment lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities we have reflected both businesses as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 144 as of june 30 2002 we had shut down our telecommunications component business for 2002 our telecommunications component business had sales of 17 million and our entertainment lighting business had sales of 103 million effect of accounting change   we adopted sfas no 142 as of the beginning of fiscal 2002 and have accordingly ceased the amortization of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the second quarter of 2002 we completed our transitional implementation of the impairment of testing provisions of sfas no 142 which resulted in a 1178 million aftertax charge for goodwill associated with the lighting reporting unit within the optoelectronics business unit in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 we have taken this charge as the effect of an accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal 2002 contingencies   we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and along with other companies have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated we have accrued 71 million as of december 29 2002 representing management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential 24 remedies possible joint and several liability the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute we expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations while it is possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from the amounts recorded 

  we and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs have alleged various statements made by us were misleading with respect to our prospects and future operating results we believe we have meritorious defenses to the lawsuits and we intend to contest the actions vigorously we are currently unable however to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss if any that may result from the resolution of these matters reporting segment results of continuing operations   we report our continuing operations as four reporting segments reflecting our management methodology and structure our security and detection systems business previously reported as part of our analytical instruments reporting segment and our telecommunications component business and entertainment lighting business previously reported as part of our optoelectronics reporting segment have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies of our reporting segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements we evaluate performance based on profitability of the respective reporting segments the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of the primary changes in operating results by reporting segment for 2002 versus 2001 and for 2001 versus 2000 

 

   2002 compared to 2001 sales for 2002 were 4943 million versus 3461 million in 2001 an increase of 1482 million or 43 year over year sales increased due primarily to the timing of the packard acquisition increased sales in our genetic screening business and increased sales in consumables and services these increases were offset in part by a decline in sales from drug discovery instruments due to challenges within the pharmaceutical research and development end markets sales in 2001 would have been approximately 1650 million higher had the results from packard been included for the first ten months of the year   operating profit for 2002 was 80 million versus a loss of 464 million in 2001 the year over year increase in operating profit was primarily attributable to the inclusion of 217 million in charges in 2002 versus 861 million in charges during 2001 principally associated with acquisitions and restructurings the operating profit for 2002 included 169 million in net restructuring charges including a 129 million charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2002 for severance and facility closure actions stemming from the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses into a single business — life and analytical sciences additionally the operating profit from 2002 included 33 million in costs incurred during the first quarter of 2002 as a result of integration efforts and 15 million from the amortization of inventory acquired as part of our acquisition of packard the results from 2001 included a 690 million charge associated with acquired inprocess research and development 60 million in integrationrelated charges 34 million of net restructuring charges a 33 million integration incentive associated with the packard acquisition a net 29 million in other charges which include the settlement of preacquisition contingencies from a prior acquisition and a 15 million charge for the revaluation of acquired inventory lower production volumes which led to lower utilization of production capacity and the inclusion of packard for the full year decreased operating profit in 2002 goodwill and intangible asset amortization expenses were 212 million for 2002 and 237 million for 2001 25   2001 compared to 2000 sales for 2001 were 3461 million versus 2214 million for 2000 an increase of 1247 million or 56 the timing of our packard and nen acquisitions contributed to the increased sales for 2001 sales for 2001 included two months of results from packard which totaled 400 million sales for 2000 would have been approximately 700 million higher had nen been included for the first seven months of the year the year over year increase in sales was also attributable to increased sales in our drug discovery tools and genetic screening businesses and increased sales in related consumables resulting from new product introductions and geographic expansions   operating loss for 2001 was 464 million versus a loss of 36 million for 2000 the year over year increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to the inclusion of 861 million in charges during 2001 versus 335 million in charges during 2000 the results from 2001 included a 690 million charge associated with acquired inprocess research and development 60 million in integrationrelated charges 34 million of net restructuring charges a 33 million integration incentive associated with our packard acquisition a net 29 million in other charges which include the settlement of preacquisition contingencies from a prior acquisition and a 15 million charge for the revaluation of acquired inventory 2000 operating profit included a 243 million charge for acquired inprocess research and development 39 million in restructuring charges 35 million in integrationrelated charges associated with our nen acquisition and a 18 million charge for the revaluation of acquired inventory sales of higher margin products and the benefit of lower costs resulting from the consolidation of manufacturing and administrative sites reduced the operating loss in 2001 goodwill and intangible asset amortization expenses were 237 million for 2001 and 93 million for 2000 

 

   2002 compared to 2001 sales for 2002 were 4974 million versus 5684 million for 2001 a decrease of 710 million or 12 the year over year decrease was due primarily to business divestitures and declines in sales due to weakness in the general analytical and pharmaceutical end markets these declines were offset by favorable changes in foreign exchange rates and by increased sales of consumables and services sales for 2001 included 474 million in sales from our instruments for research and applied science business which we divested in the fourth quarter of 2001   operating profit for 2002 was 194 million versus 778 million for 2001 a decrease of 583 million or 75 the year over year decrease in operating profit was due primarily to the inclusion of 94 million in charges during 2002 versus 161 million in net gains during 2001 as well as lower sales due to divested businesses volume declines and associated lower utilization of production capacity operating profit for 2002 included 146 million in net restructuring charges of which 131 million was taken in the fourth quarter in connection with our decision to combine our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses as well as 52 million in gains resulting from the final settlement of the disposition of property and businesses divested in prior years operating profit for 2001 included 321 million in gains realized on the disposal of businesses 84 million in reorganization charges associated with relocations to lower cost geographies consolidation of european finance functions and relocations of administrative and manufacturing facilities a restructuring charge of 53 million and a 23 million incentive payment associated with the successful completion of divestitures goodwill and intangible asset amortization expense was 44 million in 2002 and 105 million in 2001   2001 compared to 2000 sales for 2001 were 5684 million versus 6177 million for 2000 a decrease of 493 million or 8 the year over year decrease was due primarily to the disposition of our berthold business in late 2000 which had sales of approximately 300 million in the year 2000   operating profit for 2001 was 778 million versus 561 million in 2000 an increase of 217 million or 39 the year over year increase in operating profit was due primarily to productivity enhancements and cost containment actions results from 2001 included 321 million in gains realized on the disposal of businesses 84 million in reorganizationrelated charges associated with relocations to lower cost geographies consolidation of european finance functions and relocations of administrative and manufacturing facilities a restructuring charge of 53 million and a 23 million incentive payment associated with the successful completion of 26 the divestitures operating profit for 2000 included a 152 million gain from the sale of businesses goodwill and intangible asset amortization was 105 million for 2001 and 135 million for 2000 

 

   2002 compared to 2001 sales for 2002 were 3238 million versus 3802 million for 2001 a decrease of 564 million or 15 the decrease in sales in 2002 was due primarily to the impact of divested businesses and product lines which accounted for 394 million in sales for 2001 and continued weakness in the semiconductor market which more than offset growth in sales in the digital imaging and sensors end markets   operating loss for 2002 was 40 million versus an operating profit of 513 million for 2001 the year over year decline in operating profit was due primarily to a decline in sales due in part to divestitures and lower capacity utilization leading to unabsorbed manufacturing expenses partially offset by headcount reductions and the reduction and relocation of facilities 2002 operating loss included an inventory write down of 172 million which was taken during the first quarter of 2002 as the result of expected lower sales volumes in several key markets additionally 2002 operating loss included 37 million in net restructuring charges related to facility closures and workforce reduction actions 2001 operating profit included a 55 million net loss realized on the disposal of businesses reorganizationrelated charges of 49 million associated with our further expansion and relocation into lower cost manufacturing locations a 18 million retention incentive charge and 30 million in other net credits related to resolution of outstanding liabilities goodwill and intangible asset amortization was 13 million for 2002 and 70 million for 2001   2001 compared to 2000 sales for 2001 were 3802 million versus 4471 million for 2000 a decrease of 669 million or 15 the decrease in sales in 2001 was due primarily to businesses and product lines divested during 2000 and 2001 which accounted for 336 million more in sales in 2000 than they did in 2001 the decrease in sales also resulted from decreased sales in the photography and semiconductor markets offset by an increase in sales to the digital imaging and sensors markets   operating profit for 2001 was 513 million versus 961 million for 2000 a decrease of 449 million or 47 the year over year decline in operating profit was attributable to the 92 million in charges during 2001 versus 154 million in net gains during 2000 and lower sales discussed above the 2001 operating profit included a 55 million net loss realized on the disposal of businesses reorganizationrelated charges of 49 million associated with our further expansion and relocation into lower cost manufacturing locations restructuring and other net credits of 30 million mainly related to previously unresolved potential liabilities and a 18 million retention incentive the 2000 operating profit included gains of 117 million from the sale of a building 67 million from the disposition of businesses and other net credits of 30 million goodwill and intangible amortization was 70 million for both years 

 

   2002 compared to 2001 sales for 2002 were 1895 million versus 2306 million for 2001 a decrease of 411 million or 18 the decrease in sales was due primarily to weakness in the semiconductor assembly fluid testing and aerospace end markets offset by growth in the power generation end markets the decline in sales was also a result of the divestiture of two aerospace businesses which contributed 66 million during 2001   operating profit for 2002 was 175 million versus 573 million for 2001 a decrease of 398 million or 69 the decrease in operating profit was due primarily to the decline in sales previously discussed and the cost of relocating manufacturing to lower cost geographies and to a lesser extent the impact of 21 million in net onetime gains during 2001 the 2001 operating profit included 66 million in gains from the sale of two businesses during the first half of 2001 25 million in reversals of previously announced restructuring charges and 21 million in restructuringrelated charges goodwill and intangible amortization was 15 million for 2002 and 27 million for 2001   2001 compared to 2000 sales for 2001 were 2306 million versus 2518 million for 2000 a decrease of 211 million or 8 the decrease in sales in 2001 as compared to 2000 was due primarily to a decline in 27 sales to the semiconductor assembly markets partially offset by an increase in sales to the aerospace fluid testing and power generation markets 

  operating profit for 2001 was 573 million versus 451 million in 2000 an increase of 122 million or 27 the year over year increase in operating profit resulted from increased sales of higher margin products to the aerospace market and the inclusion of 66 million in onetime gains in 2001 operating profit for 2001 included gains of 66 million associated with the sale of two businesses disposed of during 2001 25 million in reversals of previously announced restructuring charges and 21 million in restructuringrelated charges operating profit for 2000 included 24 million in restructuring charges and 04 million in restructuringrelated charges offset by 28 million in gains from dispositions goodwill and intangible asset amortization was 27 million in 2001 and 25 million in 2000 liquidity and capital resources   we require cash to pay our operating expenses make capital expenditures and service our debt and other longterm liabilities our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets particularly the debt markets in the near term we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses capital expenditures and interest payments on our debt in the longterm we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other longterm liabilities   principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include    principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include  

 

 

 

   operating activities net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was 1082 million in 2002 contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2002 was a decrease in working capital which includes accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable of 974 million the working capital decrease during 2002 reflects improved working capital management as well as a 172 million inventory adjustment within our optoelectronics reporting segment offset by a net decrease of 80 million in proceeds from our receivable securitization program we decreased inventory levels by 482 million during 2002 including the 172 million optoelectronics inventory adjustment on lower sales volume noncash items contributing to the net loss during 2002 were 766 million in depreciation and amortization charges 195 million in amortization of deferred debt issuance costs accretion of discounts and net gains from extinguishment of debt 32 million in noncash restructuring actions and 26 million of stockbased compensation offsetting these amounts were 354 million in noncash benefits from deferred taxes and 32 million in net gains from dispositions and sales of investments cash outlays for accrued expenses restructuring and other assets and liabilities totaled 492 million during 2002 primarily as the result of payments toward restructuring plans and the settlement of payroll professional fees hedging and other obligations 28   investing activities in 2002 our investing activities used 1508 million of cash including our use of 1865 million of cash held in escrow to retire substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness under the zero coupon convertible debentures which were not tendered as part of our 2002 refinancing transactions in 2002 we made capital expenditures of 378 million mainly in the areas of tooling and process improvement for the drug discovery tools business and other products for biopharmaceutical applications we also expended 300 million in the settlement of a lease obligation on our fremont california facility resulting in our purchase of this facility net proceeds from the dispositions of businesses and fixed assets during 2002 of 1260 million were primarily from approximately 962 million in net proceeds received from the sale of our security and detection systems business during the second quarter of 2002 and approximately 298 million associated with the sale of facilities cash outflows of 225 million associated with acquisitions related primarily to the settlement of liabilities incurred in connection with the packard acquisition   financing activities in 2002 we generated 307 million of net cash from financing activities our debt levels increased by 814 million to 8055 million at december 29 2002 included in this amount is 1865 million of our outstanding indebtedness under the zero coupon convertible debentures which were not tendered as part of our 2002 refinancing transactions for which we had 1865 million of cash held in escrow at december 29 2002 for the purpose of retiring after consideration of the cash held in escrow our debt decreased by 1051 million because we anticipate that the cash held in escrow will be used to repurchase outstanding zero coupon debentures in 2003 we believe that an understanding of our debt levels after consideration of the escrow provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition reductions in debt included 1103 million of 2005 notes and 3043 million of zero coupon convertible debentures both of which we repurchased as part of our 2002 debt refinancing transactions debt reductions in 2002 also included 1182 million of 9375 senior subordinated tenyear notes issued by packard in march 1997 which we repurchased at a rate of 104688 and 55 million in other credit facilities we paid down during 2002 offsetting these reductions was our december 2002 issuance of senior subordinated notes which generated proceeds of 2975 million and our establishment of a term loan which generated proceeds of 3150 million in connection with these debt issuances and terminations we paid 158 million in fees during 2002 we also paid 353 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan of 131 million in 2002

  in december 2002 we deposited 1865 million in escrow to retire substantially all our outstanding zero coupon debentures assuming all of the zero coupon debentures outstanding at december 29 2002 remain outstanding at august 7 2003 our redemption of those zero coupon debentures would require 1905 million on that date we expect to use available cash to satisfy our obligations on the zero coupon debentures in excess of the escrow amount through march 11 2003 we have repurchased 325 million of accreted value of our outstanding zero coupon debentures in open market transactions using a portion of the funds held in escrow   68 notes in october 1995 we issued 1150 million in notes bearing an interest rate of 68 and maturing in 2005 interest on the 68 notes is payable semiannually on april 15 and october 15 during the fourth quarter of 2001 the fixed rate on these notes was swapped to a floating rate using a swap instrument which reset semiannually in arrears based upon sixmonth usd libor as part of our 2002 debt refinancing transactions we initiated a tender offer for all of the outstanding 68 notes as of december 29 2002 we had completed the tender offer and repurchased all but 47 million of these notes we paid consent payments pursuant to a consent solicitation we made concurrently with the tender offer the consent solicitation eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our 68 notes we may from time to time repurchase outstanding 68 notes through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise in connection with this tender offer we extinguished the swap arrangement and recorded a 44 million gain on the extinguishment   packard notes in november 2001 we completed our acquisition of packard and assumed approximately 1182 million of senior subordinated tenyear notes issued in march 1997 we redeemed the notes on march 1 2002 at a rate of 104688 in accordance with the indenture dated as of march 4 1997 as such this amount was reclassified to shortterm on our december 30 2001 balance sheet for presentation purposes in connection with this redemption we realized a loss of 55 million as a result of the call premium paid to the holders of the notes 

 

   in december 2001 we established a whollyowned consolidated subsidiary to purchase on a revolving basis certain of our accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution as collections reduce the accounts receivable balances new receivables are sold our consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables under the terms of this arrangement we retain collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances the accounts receivable securitization facility provides for up to 510 million in accounts receivable funding the facility has an effective interest rate of approximately libor plus 140 basis points as of december 29 2002 amounts funded by the counterparty under this facility were 290 million at december 29 2002 and 370 million at december 30 2001 the facility includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of bb or above as defined by standard  poor’s rating services and ba2 or above as defined by moody’s investors service at december 29 2002 we had a senior unsecured credit rating of bb with a stable outlook from standard  poor’s rating services and of ba2 with a stable outlook from moody’s investors service in january 2003 we entered into an agreement to extend the term of our accounts receivable securitization facility to january 31 2004 31 

 

   our board of directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2002 and 2001 resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per share our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding 8 78 senior subordinated notes contain restrictions that may limit our ability to pay our regular cash dividend 

 

   at our 2001 annual meeting of stockholders our stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 100000000 shares to 300000000 shares on april 24 2001 our board of directors approved a twoforone stock split the stock split has been retroactively reflected in this annual report on form 10k 

 

   the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 29 2002 and the effects we expect those obligations to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods     during 2003 we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately 40 million primarily for the introduction of new products the improvement of operating processes and the shift of production capacity to lower cost geographies we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 32 change in accounting principle and new accounting pronouncements   in june 2001 fasb issued sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under sfas no 142 goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are no longer systematically amortized but instead are subject to periodic impairment testing which at a minimum will occur on an annual basis we adopted sfas no 142 as of the beginning of fiscal 2002 and have accordingly ceased the amortization of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the second quarter of 2002 we completed our transitional implementation of the impairment testing provisions of sfas no 142 which resulted in a 1178 million aftertax charge for goodwill associated with the lighting reporting unit within our optoelectronics business unit in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 we took this charge as the effect of an accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal 2002 as part of our ongoing compliance with the sfas no 142 we will perform our annual assessment during the first quarter   our consolidated financial statements also reflect our early adoption of sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections as of july 2 2002” accordingly we reflected the gains and losses resulting from our retirement of debt during 2002 in other expense net within our consolidated income statements rather than as “extraordinary items”   in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” which nullifies eitf issue no 943 sfas no 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred whereas eitf no 943 had recognized the liability at the commitment date to an exit plan we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 146 effective for exit or disposal activities initiated by us after december 30 2002 sfas no 146 does not affect the restructuring actions that we took in the fourth quarter of 2002   in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensationtransition and disclosure — an amendment of fasb statement no 123” sfas no 148 amends sfas no 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition sfas no 148 amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results the disclosure requirements of sfas no 148 have been implemented in note 1 and note 18 to the accompanying financial statements and the interim reporting requirements will be adopted in the first interim period in 2003 we have not determined whether we will undertake a change to the fair value method in the near future as our supplemental disclosure in note 1 and note 18 indicates our adoption of the fair value provisions of sfas no 123 would have a negative effect on our consolidated income statements   in november 2002 the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” eitf issue no 0021 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services andor rights to use assets the provisions of eitf issue no 0021 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 we are currently evaluating but have not yet determined the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 0021 will have on our results of operations and financial condition   in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” fin 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties fin 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january 31 2003 for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2003 we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin 46 will have on our results of operations and financial condition 33 application of critical accounting policies and estimates   the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions   we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements   revenue recognition we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured we analyze our installation requirements and record revenue only when installation is perfunctory in instances where installation is necessary to ensure the functionality of the product we do not recognize revenue until the product is installed a provision is made at the time sales are recognized for the cost of any perfunctory installation obligations and the estimated cost of product warranties we estimate product warranty obligations based on labor and material costs we incur within the one year warranty period future changes in warranty costs could decrease or increase our earnings because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than longterm customized projects we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates   as discussed in “change in accounting principle and new accounting pronouncements” above we will be required in the third quarter of 2003 to implement eitf 0021 this standard may impact our revenue recognition methodology as described above we are currently assessing this impact   allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by 1 applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible and 2 specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty therefore if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts this would reduce our earnings and our cash flows   inventory valuation we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase andor manufacture inventory we periodically review these values to ascertain that the inventory continues to maintain a market value that is in excess of its recorded cost generally reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and where necessary record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirement or historical trailing usage of the product if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory this would reduce our earnings and cash flows   value of longlived assets including intangibles we carry a variety of longlived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment investments identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based in part upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows we undertake this review 1 on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and intangible assets and 2 on a periodic basis for other longlived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings as reported in our 2002 financial statements the 2002 initial assessment of goodwill recoverability under sfas no 142 resulted in a 1178 million charge to our earnings the charge relating to goodwill in our lighting reporting unit within our optoelectronics business segment was caused by expected declines in profitability and cash flows as a result of softness in key endmarkets while we believe that our future estimates are reasonable different assumptions regarding items 34 such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 

  employee compensation and benefits we develop estimates of the cost of the health care pension and postretirement benefits we provide to employees based on factors including current discount rates trends in health care costs projected returns on trust assets and anticipated salary increases the impact of pension and postretirement benefits have not had a material impact on the results from operations or cash flows our anticipated rate of return for our pension plans has been based in general on the average rate of return on assets expected the expected rate of return on assets is based both on our actual longterm historic return on assets and expected future rates of return for the asset investment classes the discount rates used to measure our pension obligation reflect rates at which the pension benefit could be settled the discount rates chosen are based on the current returns of investment quality bonds in light of declining interest rates and rates of asset returns we reduced our discount rate and expect to reduce our expected rate of return on plan assets the reduction in rates is not expected to have a material impact on our financial results changes in these assumptions could lead to changes in estimates of cost and consequently to additional charges or credits to our earnings we have reduced the volatility in our health care costs provided to our retirees because of the defined dollar plan feature we adopted our future liability therefore cannot be impacted by future changes in the cost of health care   restructuring activities our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of 1 severance benefits to be granted to employees based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades 2 costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs and estimates of subrental income and 3 as discussed earlier asset impairments because these accruals are estimates they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled restructuring charges net    gains or losses on dispositions at the time we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition this estimate is based on a variety of factors including current interest in the market alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we record a loss if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated accordingly we may realize amounts different than were first estimated such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our income statement   income taxes our business operations are global in nature and our tax structure is complex tax rates in countries throughout the world vary substantially and are on occasion subject to fluctuations given the current political and economic climate in those countries we employ tax planning strategies so as to minimize our overall tax burden these strategies contemplate tax rates being in effect in certain countries and we use these rates to determine both our current and deferred tax status any significant fluctuations in rates and tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rates 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

 

   financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments marketable securities and accounts receivable we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december 29 2002 35   in the ordinary course of business we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs effectiveness of these cash flow hedges is measured utilizing the cumulative dollar offset method and is reviewed quarterly for the year ended december 29 2002 net losses from hedges reclassified from other comprehensive income to sales and expense totaled 639000 the notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately 1030 million at december 29 2002 and 2800 million as of december 30 2001 at december 29 2002 the approximate fair value for foreign currency derivative contracts designated as fair value hedges was insignificant at december 30 2001 the approximate fair value for foreign currency derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges was 560000 

 

   market risk we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures   foreign exchange risk as a multinational corporation we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates these exposures can take a variety of different forms  36   we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations the derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes we specifically use forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and use a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies the success of the hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses the principal currencies hedged are the british pound canadian dollar euro japanese yen and singapore dollar in those currencies where there is a liquid costeffective forward market we maintain hedge coverage between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure   foreign currency risk — valueatrisk disclosure  — we utilize a valueat risk “var” model to determine the potential earning fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments as discussed above we seek to minimize such exposures through our hedging program our var computation is based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days as of december 29 2002 this computation estimated that there is a 5 chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than 06 million this var measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program specifically during the four quarters ended december 29 2002 the var ranged between 06 million and 16 million and averaged approximately 11 million   interest rate risk as described earlier our debt portfolio includes both fixed rate and variable rate instruments fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our shortterm cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings for the year ended december 29 2002 we maintained for a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio an interest rate swap that served to effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt this interest rate swap was specifically designed to serve as both a fair value hedge on our 68 115 million debt and to modify our cash flows so that our net interest payments would be reduced in the event that interest rates continued to decline the swap was marked to market in our consolidated financial statements so that fair value movements in the swap were offset by the fair value movement in the debt this swap position was terminated at the end of 2002 when the 68 debt was effectively retired   interest rate risk — sensitivity  — as we have discussed above we have restructured our debt in the fourth quarter of 2002 accordingly as of december 29 2002 61 of our debt portfolio is composed of fixed rate debt and 39 represented by variable rate debt there are currently no interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments outstanding intended to hedge fair value cash flow or earnings exposures our current debt covenants also require that we maintain at least 50 of our debt portfolio in fixed rate debt as defined in the credit agreement our current earnings exposure can be summarized as follows  37 forwardlooking information and factors affecting future performance   this annual report on form 10k contains “forwardlooking statements” as defined in section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 for this purpose any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forwardlooking statements words such as “believes” “anticipates” “plans” “expects” “will” and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by these forwardlooking statements including among others the factors set forth below   the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations our operating results may continue to be harmed by cyclical downturns affecting several of the industries into which we sell our products   some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical industry downturns often are characterized by reduced product demand excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling prices and profits significant downturns in our customers’ markets and in general economic conditions have resulted in a reduced demand for several of our products and have hurt our operating results for example during 2002 our operating results were adversely affected by downturns in many of the markets we serve including the pharmaceutical biomedical semiconductor and aerospace markets current economic conditions have caused a decrease in capital spending by many of our customers which in turn has adversely affected our sales and business these trends are continuing in 2003 if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer   we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products could become technologically obsolete over time in which case our sales and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to    many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products therefore we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products in developing new products we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invests heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales   in addition some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications for example some of our license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research and exclude clinical diagnostics applications our substantial debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities   we have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness as of december 29 2002 we had approximately 8055 million in outstanding indebtedness including 1865 million in outstanding zero coupon 38 debentures excluding obligations under our accounts receivable securitization facility also we have 1000 million in borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility 

  our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay the principal or interest in respect of our indebtedness we may also obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage   our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences including    a significant portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates as a result our interest payment obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase   our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy if we are unable to service our debt and fund our business we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures seek additional financing or equity capital restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all restrictions in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our 8 78 notes may limit our activities   our senior credit facility and the indenture relating to our 8 78 notes contain and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to  39    we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition   our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under our senior credit facility would trigger an event of default under our 8 78 notes and a default under our 8 78 notes would trigger an event of default under the senior credit facility and possibly other debt   if an event of default occurs we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under our indebtedness if we are unable to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility those lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings under that agreement our inability to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility may also cause a default under other of our obligations including our accounts receivable securitization facility economic political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales   because we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our sales originating outside the united states represented 66 of our total sales in the fiscal year ended december 29 2002 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including  our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate   given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations and we can offer no assurance of our ability to make such adjustments or to make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales 40 research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

 we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing business or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable   we have in the past and may in the future supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines such as our acquisition of packard bioscience company in november 2001 we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons including    some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations   to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us if we do not successfully integrate our life sciences and analytical instruments business units we may not achieve the benefits we anticipate we will derive from the combination of these businesses   in the fourth quarter of 2002 we announced the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments business units into a new integrated business named life and analytical sciences representing 66 of our total sales for 2002 this combination is subject to various integration risks and the integration of these two business units may not achieve the benefits we anticipate it will achieve as a result of the combination we may experience a loss of productivity sales and key personnel in addition the information technology systems of the two businesses may not be fully compatible if any of these potential difficulties were to occur and persist the business results of our life sciences and analytical instruments reporting segments could suffer 41   we are targeting annualized cost savings from the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses of between 300 million and 450 million because we anticipate that the benefits of the combination of these businesses will not be fully realized until 2004 we are targeting cost savings of between 120 million and 250 million in 2003 while we believe these cost savings to be reasonable they are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature in addition unforeseen factors may offset some or all of the estimated cost savings or other benefits from the integration as a result our actual cost savings if any could differ or be delayed compared to our estimates our loss of licenses may require us to stop selling products or lose competitive advantage   we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage potential competitors could inlicense technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share   our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license such as the right to exclusivity in a market in some cases we could lose all rights under the license in addition rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control for example the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons including invalidity of the licensed patent or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses if we do not compete effectively our business will be harmed   we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties   some of the products produced by our life and analytical sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar international agencies in addition some of the activities of our fluid sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the united states federal aviation administration these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales resales and distribution if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses   we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products obtaining and enforcing patent protection for our proprietary products processes and technologies may be difficult and expensive we may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties   patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing and marketing new technologies and products is timeconsuming and expensive we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents to cover our products we may not obtain issued patents from any pending or 42 future patent applications owned by or licensed to us the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology 

third parties may seek to challenge invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to us or claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights   in addition to our patents we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties the measures that we employ to protect this technology and these rights may not be adequate moreover in some cases the licensor can terminate a license or convert it to a nonexclusive arrangement if we fail to meet specified performance targets   we may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties in addition claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing using importing or selling our products in the united states or abroad our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets   as of december 29 2002 our total assets included 14 billion of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights trademark rights and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization these assets have historically been amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives in connection with our adoption of sfas no 142 we discontinued the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets beginning in fiscal 2002 instead we will test these items at a minimum on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned   during the second quarter of 2002 we completed our transitional implementation of the impairment testing provisions of sfas no 142 which resulted in a 1178 million beforeandaftertax charge for goodwill associated with our lighting business in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 we took this charge as the effect of an accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal 2002   future impairment testing may result in additional intangible asset writeoffs which could adversely affect our results of operations 43

highly demanding environments this business unit provides precision valves seals bellows pneumatic joints coatings and subassemblies to the aerospace semiconductor equipment power generation maintenance repair and overhaul and fluid testing markets   during july 2001 the company announced its intention to sell its security and detection systems business and consequently moved that business to discontinued operations on january 3 2002 perkinelmer announced an agreement to sell this business to l3 communications for approximately 100 million the proposed sale is currently being reviewed by the us department of justice and is expected to be finalized during the first half of 2002 security and detection systems is a leading supplier of xray inspection equipment that screens airline baggage and cargo   on august 20 1999 the company sold the assets of its technical services business including the outstanding capital stock of egg defense material inc a subsidiary of the company to egg technical services inc an affiliate of the carlyle group lp for approximately 250 million in cash and the assumption by the buyer of certain liabilities of the technical services segment results of this unit have been classified as discontinued operations through its technical services segment the company provided engineering scientific management and technical support services to a broad range of governmental and industrial customers   sales from the discontinued operations of the technical services fluid sciences and security and detection systems businesses were 2717 million 3597 million and 6151 million during 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively marketing   all three of the company’s business units life sciences optoelectronics and analytical instruments market their products and services through their own specialized sales forces as well as independent foreign and domestic manufacturer’s representatives and distributors in certain foreign countries these operating segments have entered into joint venture and license agreements with local firms to manufacture and market their products raw materials and supplies   raw materials and supplies used by each of the company’s business units are generally readily available in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources patents and trademarks   while the company’s patents trademarks and licenses in the aggregate are important to its business the company does not believe that the loss of any one patent trademark or license or group of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a materially adverse effect on the overall business of the company or on any of its operating segments the company has both trademarks and registered trademarks for a variety of its product names backlog   the company believes that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of its strategic business units due to the shortlead time required on a majority of the company’s sales therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business competition   because of the wide range of its products and services the company faces many different types of competition and competitors this affects its ability to sell its products and services and the prices at which 5 such products and services are sold competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations that produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and which may have greater financial and other resources than the company to small concerns producing a small number of goods or services for specialized market segments 

  in the life sciences segment competition is on the basis of product availability and reliability and service level competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well established market niches the company competes in these markets on the basis of innovative technologies product differentiation and quality the proportion of large competitors in this segment is expected to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors   in the optoelectronics segment no single competitor competes directly with this business unit across its full product range however the company does compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacture and sale of specialty flashtubes and ultraspecialty lighting sources certain photodetectors and photodiodes switched power supplies and telecommunications products competition is based on price technological innovation operational efficiency and product reliability and quality   in the analytical instruments segment no single competitor competes directly with this business unit as a whole the company competes with instrument companies that serve particular segments of markets in industrial instrumentation and imagining detection systems the company competes in this segment primarily on the basis of product performance product reliability service and price research and development   during 2001 2000 and 1999 companysponsored research and development expenditures were approximately 81 million 77 million and 67 million respectively environmental compliance   the company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former company locations and along with other companies has been named a potentially responsible party a “prp” for certain waste disposal sites the company accrues for environmental issues in the accounting period in which the company’s responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated the company has accrued 69 million as of december 30 2001 representing management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters this amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where the company has been named a prp management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute the company expects that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to five years as assessments and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations while it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may have been incurred the preliminary stages of the investigations make it impossible for the company to reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure employees   as of march 1 2002 the company employed roughly 10800 employees of which approximately 9300 were employed within its continuing operations certain of the company’s subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions the company considers its relations with employees to be satisfactory 6 financial information about operating segments   sales and operating profit by segment for continuing operations for the three years ended december 30 2001 are shown in the table below    the company’s fluid sciences business security and detection systems business and technical services

53400 square feet of leased space in wellesley massachusetts the company’s other operations are conducted in manufacturing and assembly plants research laboratories administrative offices and other facilities located in nine states and 39 foreign countries 

  nonus facilities account for approximately 1600000 square feet of owned and leased property or approximately 50 of the company’s total occupied space   the company’s real property leases are both shortterm and longterm in management’s opinion the company’s properties are wellmaintained and are adequate for its present requirements   the following table indicates the approximate square footage of real property owned and leased attributable to each of the company’s operating segments for continuing operations  item 3 legal proceedings   the company is subject to various claims legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the company the company has established accruals for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable management believes that any liability that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters in excess of amounts provided will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company   in september 2001 the company announced that it had resolved its us tax court case with the internal revenue service irs the case which was brought by the irs in 1995 primarily involved accounting for gains and intercompany pricing during the years 1985 through 1994 the irs had proposed additional tax of 74 million plus interest the settlement however awarded a small refund to the company and eliminated all outstanding disputes with the irs   the company and its subsidiary egg idaho inc were named in 1998 as defendants in a lawsuit pending in the united states district court for the district of idaho filed by two former employees of egg idaho under the civil false claims act the suit names as defendants six entities which were formerly or currently are prime contractors or subcontractors to the united states department of energy at the idaho national engineering and environmental laboratory plaintiffs allege that the defendants submitted false claims to the government for reimbursement of environmental activities which they knew or should have known had either not been performed or were performed improperly the district court recently granted the company’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed most but not all of the allegations involving the company the plaintiffs may appeal that ruling the plaintiffs have yet to quantify the damages they are seeking   the company’s subsidiary egg rocky flats inc and two other companies were also named as defendants in january 2000 in a civil false claim action pending in the united states district court for the district of colorado involving security issues at the united states department of energy’s rocky flats plant in response to a motion filed by the united states department of justice the district court dismissed the case the plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal   the company intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters and believes that their ultimate disposition will not

portfolio during the three years ended december 30 2001 are highlighted below   2001    2000    1999  other accomplishments   other significant accomplishments during 2001 included  13    as a result of the significant amount of changes the results period over period are frequently not comparable in order to improve the comparability of financial results the company has highlighted nonrecurring items in all periods and presented a discussion of the results excluding these items nonrecurring items represent income and expenses associated with an acquisition restructuring divestiture or other unusual event that are not expected to have an impact on ongoing operations 2001 acquisitions and divestitures   on november 13 2001 the company completed the acquisition of packard bioscience company “packard” for consideration of approximately 762 million in the form of approximately 22 million common shares and the assumption of 118 million in debt the acquisition extends the company’s capabilities in automated liquid handling and sample preparation and strengthens the company’s position as a global provider of comprehensive drug discovery solutions packard a global developer manufacturer and marketer of instruments software and related consumables and services for use in drug discovery and other life sciences research generated sales of approximately 165 million for its year ended december 31 2000   packard’s operations assumed as of the date of acquisition are reported within the results from operations of the life sciences segment the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with the recently issued financial accounting standards board statement no 141 business combinations “sfas no 141” and the company has accordingly allocated the purchase price of packard based upon the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation of the purchase price has not yet been finalized however the company does not expect material changes portions of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed were valued by independent appraisers utilizing customary valuation procedures and techniques these intangible assets included 690 million in acquired inprocess research and development for projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and for which no future alternative use existed these costs were expensed during the fourth quarter of 2001 other acquired intangible assets valued at 2373 million included the fair value of trade names trademarks patents and developed technology of this amount 765 million has been ascribed to trade names and trademarks for which an indefinite life has been assigned the packard acquisition also resulted in goodwill of 4386 million which is not being amortized in accordance with sfas no 141 effective for all business combinations completed subsequent to july 1 2001   during the fourth quarter of 2001 the company sold its instruments for research and applied science business “iras” and its voltarc technologies “voltarc” business these sales resulted in a gain of 323 million and a loss of 63 million respectively additionally the company has deferred gains of approximately 30 million in connection with certain contingencies related to the iras sale the combined net income of these businesses was 14 million in 2001 through date of disposal and 54 million in 2000   the packard acquisition and 2001 dispositions are expected to result in a higher concentration of revenue in the life sciences segment in future periods 14 adjusted income from operations   the following table presents adjusted net income which excludes goodwill and intangibles amortization and the impact of nonrecurring items    the following table reconciles adjusted income from continuing operations to net income on a reported basis    note certain components within the nonrecurring items captions for the prior year have been adjusted in some instances for ease of comparability to current year references to reported results refer to us gaap whereas adjusted results reflect the us gaap results excluding the impact of goodwill and intangible amortization and the impact of nonrecurring items 15 discussion of consolidated results of operations — 2001 compared to 2000 sales 2001 compared to 2000   sales for 2001 were 13301 million

revenue of 74 million associated with divested businesses the negative impact of foreign exchange of 26 million and organic revenue decline of 8 million organic revenue which the company defines as growth in historical businesses plus growth in acquired businesses assuming they were owned in prior periods adjusted for the effects of exited businesses and foreign exchange was strong in the life sciences segment as a result of market expansion and new product introductions but was offset by declines in electronicbased endmarkets 2000 compared to 1999   sales for 2000 were 13355 million versus 10508 million in 1999 representing an increase of 2847 million or 27 incremental revenue from the acquisition of nen and ai organic growth in the life sciences and optoelectronics segments as well as new product introductions within the life sciences segment contributed to the increase   cost of sales 2001 compared to 2000   reported cost of sales of 7217 million for 2001 versus 7569 million during 2000 represented a decrease of 352 million or 5 on a percentageofsales basis cost of sales decreased to 54 in 2001 from 57 during 2000 the decrease is reflective of the company’s continued productivity and cost containment gains in the form of headcount and facility rationalization and further expansion and relocation into lower cost manufacturing geographies as well as strategic moves into higher margin businesses   adjusted cost of sales which excludes the impact of nonrecurring items was 7063 million for 2001 versus 7533 million for 2000 representing a 470 million or 6 decrease

nonrecurring charges principally comprised of the writeup of inventory acquired as part of the ai acquisition   research and development and inprocess research and development charges 2001 compared to 2000   reported research and development expenses including inprocess research and development charges increased to 1504 million in 2001 from 1012 million in 2000 an increase of 492 million or 49 as a result of higher inprocess research and development charges in 2001 research and development efforts during 2001 were mainly directed in the end markets of drug discovery tools pharmaceutical and biomedical within the life sciences business 16   adjusted research and development costs which exclude the impact of nonrecurring items were 813 million in 2001 versus 769 million in 2000 an increase of 44 million or 6 as a percentage of sales research and development costs on an adjusted basis represented 6 of sales for both 2001 and 2000 a trend reflective of the company’s continued commitment

sales basis adjusted research and development costs were 6 for both 2000 and 1999 nonrecurring charges for 2000 were 243 million which represented a writeoff of inprocess research and development charges associated with the nen acquisition nonrecurring charges for 1999 were 230 million which represented a similar writeoff related to the ai acquisition   selling general and administrative expenses 2001 compared to 2000   reported sga expenses for 2001 were 4111 million versus 3759 million for 2000 representing an increase of 352 million or 9 the increase primarily reflects the inclusion of expenses associated with packard’s operations of 9 million assumed during the fourth quarter of 2001 increased amortization expenses associated with the nen and packard acquisitions of 113 million as well as the restructuring and reorganization related charges noted below   adjusted sga expenses which exclude goodwill and intangibles amortization and the impact of nonrecurring items

longlived assets within the analytical instruments and optoelectronics segments these charges are considered nonrecurring in the company’s presentation of adjusted net income gains on dispositions 2001 compared to 2000   dispositions resulted in a net gain of 266 million for 2001 versus a net gain of 351 million in 2000 the gain in 2001 resulted principally from the 323 million gain on the sale of the instruments for research and applied sciences business previously part of the analytical instruments business and approximately 06 million in net gains resulting from dispositions in the optoelectronics and analytical instruments businesses offset in part by the 63 million loss resulting from the sale of the voltarc technologies business previously part of the optoelectronics segment the gain in 2000 included a gain of approximately 167 million on the sale of a building a 100 million gain on the disposition of the company’s berthold business 67 million in gains from other

resolution of certain events and contingencies the resulting impact for both years is considered nonrecurring in the company’s presentation of adjusted net income   other expense net 2001 compared to 2000   other expense net for 2001 was 298 million versus 337 million in 2000 representing a decrease of 39 million or 12 other expense net consisted principally of interest from debt associated with prior acquisitions the decrease is caused primarily by the impact of nonrecurring gains which consisted of gains realized on the sale of investments of 43 million and 09 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively   other expense net excluding nonrecurring items was 341 million versus 346 million decreased interest rates offset the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the acquisition of nen in 2000 2000 compared to 1999   other expense net for 2000 was 337 million versus 150 million in 1999 an increase of 187 million the increase is primarily the result of increased debt levels as a result of acquisitions as well as the impact of foreign exchange losses as discussed the 2000 expense includes a 09 million nonrecurring gain associated with the sale of an investment the 1999 results did not include any nonrecurring amounts 18 provision for income taxes 2001 compared to 2000   provision for income taxes was 348 million for 2001 versus 397 million in 2000 the 2001 tax rate was primarily impacted by the tax treatment of inprocess research and development charges associated with the packard acquisition with a minor benefit resulting from a refund on a case previously brought by the internal revenue service the 2000 rate was impacted to a lesser extent by similar inprocess research and development charges as discussed below   provision for income taxes on adjusted net income was 409 million in 2001 and 364 million in 2000 the effective rate on an adjusted basis was 26 for 2001 versus 28 for 2000 the decrease in effective rate was primarily the result of the company’s continued expansion of manufacturing operations to lower tax jurisdictions 2000 compared to 1999   provision for income taxes was 397 million in 2000 versus 46 million in 1999 the effective rate for both years was 40 on a reported basis and reflected the tax impact of inprocess research and development charges for the nen acquisition during 2000 and the ai acquisition during 1999   provision for income taxes on adjusted net income was 364 million in 2000 versus 247 million in 1999 the effective rate was 28 for both periods on an adjusted basis segment results of operations   the

business previously reported as part of the company’s instruments segment and fluid sciences business have been classified as discontinued operations in accordance with accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 30 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions “apb no 30” the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements the company evaluates performance based on operating profit of the respective segments the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of the primary changes in operating results by segment for 2001 versus 2000 and 2000 versus 1999   life sciences 2001 compared to 2000   sales for 2001 were 3461 million versus 2214 million in 2000 representing a 1247 million or 56 increase this increase reflects approximately 102 million from the combined impact of the inclusion of the results of operations of nen for a full year and two months of results associated with packard the increase was also driven by strong growth in the drug discovery and genetic screening businesses and growth in related consumables resulting from new product introductions and geographic expansions leading to organic growth in excess of 12   the reported operating loss for 2001 was 460 million versus a loss of 36 million in 2000 due to the inclusion of purchase accounting and restructuring charges associated with the acquisition of packard during 2001 partially offset by similar charges during 2000 from the nen acquisition as discussed below   adjusted operating profit excluding goodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items was 639 million for 2001 which represented a 247 million or 63 increase over that of 2000 as a percentage of sales adjusted operating profit rose to 185 from 177 as a result of sales of higher margin products and the impact of productivity and cost containment associated with the consolidation of manufacturing and administrative sites goodwill and intangibles amortization was 237 million for 2001 versus 93 million for 2000 as a result of the acquisitions discussed above nonrecurring charges during 2001 totaled 862 million consisting of a 690 million charge associated with acquired inprocess research and development a 15 million charge for the revaluation of acquired inventory 34 million of net restructuring charges a 33 million integration incentive associated with the packard acquisition 60 million in integrationrelated 19 charges outside the scope of purchase accounting and a net 28 million in other charges which include the settlement of certain preacquisition contingencies from a prior

2000 compared to 1999   sales of 2214 million for 2000 increased 634 million or 40 versus 1999 organic revenue growth for 2000 was 18 higher volumes from high throughput screening and drug discovery applications revenues from new product introductions in the areas of genetic screening and drug discovery tools and the inclusion of revenues from nen life sciences acquired in august 2000 were the primary drivers of the increase in 2000 versus 1999   reported operating loss for 2000 was 36 million versus reported operating income of 158 million in 1999 the decline is attributed principally to the impact of purchase accounting and restructuring charges associated with the acquisition of nen   adjusted operating profit before goodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items for 2000 was 392 million representing an increase of 152 million or 63 versus 1999 higher revenues discussed above particularly sales of highermargin new products and revenues from the nen acquisition

2000 the lower revenue was a result of an organic revenue decline of 10 as well as the impact of divested businesses and product lines this decline in organic revenue reflects continued weakness in the photography semiconductor and telecom component markets which more than offset strong growth in the digital imaging sensors and biomedical markets   reported operating profit for 2001 was 458 million down 511 million or 53 from the 969 million recognized during 2000 the decline was driven principally by the decreases in revenue discussed above and the costs associated with moving to lower cost production locations and streamlining operations   adjusted operating profit for 2001 was 686 million representing a 150 million or 18 decrease from 836 million for 2000 as a percentage of sales adjusted operating profit was 165 for 2001 versus 168 for 2000 with the impact of the reduction in sales offset to some degree by cost savings and productivity enhancements associated with reduced headcount and facility costs as well as moves to lower cost geographies the 2001 reported operating profit included goodwill and intangibles amortization of 81 million as well as nonrecurring items of 147 million nonrecurring items were primarily comprised of a 40 million inventory writeoff related to unexpected declines in enduser demand in the telecom component business a 55 million net loss

operating profit increased 566 million in 2000 to 969 million versus 403 million in 1999 representing a 140 increase the increase in 2000 was due primarily to higher revenues discussed above the sale of higher margin new specialty lighting products and the continued benefits of six sigma and other manufacturing initiatives and the nonrecurring credits discussed below   adjusted operating profit before goodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items for 2000 was 836 million increasing 253 million or 43 versus 1999 the 2000 reported operating profit included goodwill and intangibles amortization of 81 million and net nonrecurring gains of 214 million nonrecurring items included gains on dispositions of 234 million restructuring credits of 99 million restructuring

sales for 2001 were 5682 million a decrease of 491 million or 8 versus the 6173 million recognized during 2000 the decline in revenue was driven principally by the disposition of the berthold business in late 2000 which had revenue of 30 million in the year 2000 as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange of 14 million in 2001 organically the business contracted less than 1   reported operating profit for 2001 was 784 million versus 569 million in 2000 an increase of 215 million or 38 the increase during 2001 reflects the impact of nonrecurring gains associated with the sale of the

resulting from the berthold sale   adjusted operating profit before goodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items was 728 million for 2001 versus 617 million for 2000 representing an 111 million or 18 increase as a percentage of sales adjusted operating profit rose from 100 to 128 driven principally by reductions in headcount of over 350 people as a result of transitioning european manufacturing to lower cost asian facilities as well as consolidating european sales and back office operations adjusted operating profit for 2001 excludes goodwill and intangibles amortization of 105 million and net nonrecurring gains of 161 million nonrecurring items included 321 million in gains realized on the disposal of businesses a restructuring charge of 53 million a 23

the effects of a stronger dollar in 2000   reported operating profit for 2000 was 569 million versus an operating loss in 1999 of 214 million the increase is due primarily to the inclusion of the ai acquisition for a full year in 2000 improvements in manufacturing cost structure and benefits from restructuring actions   for 2000 adjusted operating profit before goodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items was 617 million versus 402 million in 1999 representing an increase of 215 million or 53 the 2000 reported operating profit included goodwill and intangibles

has been retroactively reflected in this report environmental   the company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former company locations and along with other companies has been named a potentially responsible party prp for certain waste disposal sites the company accrues for environmental issues in the accounting period that the company’s responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated the company has accrued 69 million as of december 30 2001 representing management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters such amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables including the stage of the environmental investigations the magnitude of the possible contamination the nature of the potential remedies possible joint and several liability the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations for sites where the company has been named a prp management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute the company expects that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to five years as assessments and remediation activities progress at each individual site these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations while it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may have been incurred the preliminary stages of the investigations make it impossible for the company to reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure liquidity and capital resources cash flows   net cash provided by operating activities was 1110 million in 2001 compared to 982 million in 2000 for 2001 this was comprised of net income before depreciation amortization and other noncash items of 1768 million partially offset by gains on disposition of assets net of 309 million and 349 million net change in certain assets and liabilities and other items during 2001 the 2000 operating cash flow was comprised of net income before depreciation amortization and other noncash items of 1626 million partially offset by gains on dispositions of assets net of 372 million and 272 million of net change in certain assets liabilities and other items during the period   included in the change in assets and liabilities for 2001 was a 395 million increase in inventory due to lower than planned sales in a number of the businesses primarily in the optoelectronics segment and inventory safety stock for production moves 315 million in restructuring payments partially offset by a 140 million reduction in accounts receivable which is net of 370 million from a receivable securitization program that is discussed below 23   capital expenditures were 887 million in 2001 versus 553 million in 2000 this increase was due to a 30 million leasehold improvement at a new worldwide headquarters facility for the analytical instruments business and a 20 million expansion of the company’s telecom manufacturing capability the company estimates capital expenditures for 2002 of approximately 60 million principally for equipment process improvement and maintenance associated with increasing productivity and capacity within the businesses of drug discovery tools and other biomedical applications   cash flow from the sale of businesses primarily iras and voltarc was 575 million and from the monetization of assets was 563 million for 2001 monetization of assets consisted of the sale of nonstrategic assets and the saleleaseback of facilities and equipment costs of acquisitions net of cash acquired generated 455 million of cash in 2001 principally from the packard acquisition versus a usage of 4315 million in 2000 during 2000 cash flow from the sale of businesses was 492 million and from the monetization of assets was 339 million monetization of assets during 2000 included the sale of assets nonstrategic investments and the saleleaseback of facilities   cash flows generated through operating and investing activities along with proceeds of 394 million from the exercise of stock options were used in part to reduce shortterm commercial paper borrowings by 1770 million during 2001 in 2000 the company issued convertible debt with net proceeds totaling 448 million these proceeds along with net borrowings under commercial paper of approximately 370 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 469 million were used in part to reduce other debt balances by approximately 2340 million cash utilized in the payment of dividends to common stockholders totaled 283 million during 2001 borrowing arrangements   the company maintains two unsecured lines of credit totaling 370 million in march 2002 the company’s revolving credit facility was refinanced in the amount of 270 million and will expire in march 2003 in march 2001 the company’s 100 million revolving credit facility was refinanced and will expire in march 2006 these agreements which serve as backup facilities for the commercial paper borrowings have no significant commitment fees the credit lines if drawn bear interest at libor plus 60 basis points under the terms of the credit agreement the company is required to maintain certain minimum debt to total capital and interest coverage ratios there were no amounts outstanding under these lines at december 31 2000 or december 30 2001 nor during any time period in these two years and the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants   at december 30 2001 and december 31 2000 longterm debt was 5981 million and 5833 million respectively included in these amounts are 115 million of unsecured tenyear notes issued in october 1995 which carry an interest rate of 68 and mature in 2005 during the fourth quarter of 2001 this fixed rate was swapped to a floating rate resulting in an allincost of funds of 446 during 2001 a reduction of 234 from the fixed rate this interest rate swap instrument resets semiannually in arrears based upon six month usd libor the fair value of this instrument as of december 30 2001 was 23 million which is offset by a corresponding gain on the underlying bond other longterm debt includes zero coupon senior convertible debentures described below which had a 483 million accreted value at 2001 and a 468 million accreted value at 2000 the carrying amount of the unsecured tenyear notes and senior subordinated tenyear notes approximated the estimated fair value at december 30 2001 based on a quoted market price the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures approximated 512 million at december 30 2001 also based on a quoted market price   as discussed above in 2001 the company relocated its analytical instruments headquarters to a new leased facility and prefunded 30 million of leasehold improvements originally these improvements were to be included in the operating lease of the facility however the company determined it was more economical to purchase the leasehold improvements and fund them through asset securitization consequently the company established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to purchase on a revolving basis certain of the company’s accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution as collections reduce the accounts receivable balances new receivables are sold the company’s consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables and 24 accordingly the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on the company’s balance sheet under the terms of this arrangement the company retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances the facility is renewable on an annual basis and has an effective interest rate of approximately libor plus 30 basis points amounts sold under this facility during 2001 approximated 37 million this amount has reduced the outstanding receivables balance 

  in august 2000 the company sold zero coupon senior convertible debentures with an aggregate purchase price of 460 million the company used the offering’s net proceeds of approximately 448 million to repay a portion of its commercial paper borrowings which had been increased temporarily to finance the nen acquisition deferred issuance costs of 12 million were recorded as a noncurrent asset and are being amortized over three years the debentures are due august 2020 and were priced with a yield to maturity of 35 at maturity the company would be required to repay 921 million comprised of 460 million of original purchase price plus accrued original issue discount the company may redeem some or all of the debentures at any time on or after august 7 2003 at a redemption price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount through the redemption date holders of the debentures may require the company to repurchase some or all of the debentures in august 2003 and august 2010 or at any time upon certain changes of control in the company at a repurchase price equal to the initial price to the public plus the accrued original issue discount through the date of the repurchase the company has the right to repay some or all of the debentures with common stock based on the then current market price subject to satisfying conditions within the trust indenture particularly the company’s ability to register the necessary common shares under applicable securities laws the company may only exercise this right in connection with a repurchase at the option of the holders or a repurchase in connection with certain changes in control the debentures are currently convertible into 108 million shares of the company’s common stock at approximately 44 per share   in november 2001 the company completed its acquisition of packard bioscience company and assumed 118 million of senior subordinated tenyear notes issued in march 1997 the company redeemed the notes on march 1 2002 at a rate of 104688 in accordance with the indenture dated as of march 4 1997 as such this amount has been reclassified to shortterm for presentation purposes   as of december 30 2001 the company was in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in its credit agreements and indentures although a downgrade in the company’s credit rating could affect the pricing of shortterm liquidity sources such as commercial paper the only credit agreement or indenture the company maintains with ratings downgrades that would accelerate the maturity dates of debt is the receivables securitization program discussed above the company and its subsidiaries are parties to various other financing and leasing arrangements which do not contain any ratings triggers contractual obligations   the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations at december 30 2001 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods   25    included in the lease commitments disclosed in the preceding table is a sixyear operating lease agreement signed in 2000 for a facility in the optoelectronics segment at the end of the lease term the company at its option may i renew the lease ii purchase the property at a price equal to the lessor’s original cost approximately 30 million or iii allow the lease to expire and cause the property to be sold the company’s ability to cause the property to be sold depends upon its compliance with certain terms of the lease under certain conditions the company would receive any excess of the net sales proceeds over the property’s original cost in the event that the net sales proceeds are less than the original cost the company would be required to make certain contingent rental payments to the lessor equal to that difference subject to a maximum amount   the company requires cash to pay its operating expenses make capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay debt service including principal and interest the company’s principal sources of funds are from its operations and the capital markets particularly the debt markets the company also anticipates receiving significant cash in the near term from the projected dispositions of its discontinued operations   in the near term the company anticipates that its operations will generate sufficient cash to fund its operating expenses capital expenditures and interest payments on its debt depending on the size of the transaction the company may require funds from external sources for acquisitions that it effects for cash the company may also require funds from external sources to refinance the principal of its debt as it matures particularly the 510 million of zero coupon convertible debentures that holders will have the option to put in 2003 and the 123 million of principal that becomes due on its 68 unsecured notes in 2005   principal factors that could affect the company’s internally generated funds include    principal factors that could affect the company’s ability to obtain cash from external sources include  critical accounting policies and estimates   the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes restructuring pensions and other postretirement benefits and contingencies and litigation the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 26   the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements   the company’s product sales are recorded at the time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured a provision is made at the time the related revenue is recognized for the cost of any installation obligations and the estimated cost of product warranties when other significant obligations remain after products are delivered including certain customer acceptance provisions revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled if a loss is anticipated on any contract a provision for the entire loss is made immediately revenue related to the sale of maintenance contracts is deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over the service period for equipment leased to a customer under a salestype lease revenue recognition generally commences when the equipment has been shipped installed and is ready for use   the company values inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase andor manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory inventory quantities on hand are regularly reviewed and where necessary provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months or historical trailing twelve month usage a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a shortterm increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand requiring additional inventory writedowns   the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required   the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its longlived assets and investments for continued appropriateness this review is based upon its projections of anticipated future cash flows market conditions legal factors and operational performance while it believes that its future estimates are reasonable different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could materially affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   financial instruments   financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and accounts receivable the company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december 30 2001   in the ordinary course of business the company enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and thirdparty receivables and payables the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies have maturities that do not exceed 12 months have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet credit risk and market risk are minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions unrealized gains and losses on the company’s foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and for hedges designated as cash flow the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs effectiveness of these cash flow hedges is measured utilizing the cumulative dollar offset method and is reviewed quarterly for the year ended december 30 2001 net losses from hedges reclassified from other comprehensive income to revenue and expense totaled 36000 the notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately 280 million as of december 30 2001 and 190 million at december 31 2000 at december 30 2001 the approximate fair value for foreign currency derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges was 560000 and at december 31 2000 was not significant the approximate fair value for 27 foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges was 380000 and is recorded in other current assets with the offset to other comprehensive income this gain will be recognized in earnings over the next 12 months 

market risk   market risk the company is exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures the company enters into various derivative transactions pursuant to the company’s policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures   foreign exchange risk as a multinational corporation the company is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates as the company’s international sales grow exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a materially adverse impact on the company’s financial results the company’s risk from exchange rates is primarily related to nondollar denominated sales in europe and asia the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations the derivative instruments held by the company are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes the company uses forward contracts to hedge its net asset position and uses a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows the company’s hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies the success of the hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility the company could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses the principal currencies hedged are the british pound canadian dollar euro japanese yen and singapore dollar in those currencies where there is a liquid costeffective forward market the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure   interest rate risk the company maintains an investment portfolio consisting of securities of various issuers types and maturities the investments are classified as available for sale these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in comprehensive income these instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes   valueatrisk the company utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential loss in fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive derivative financial instruments within a 95 confidence interval the company’s computation was based on the interrelationships between movements in interest rates and foreign currencies these interrelationships were determined by observing historical interest rate and foreign currency market changes over corresponding periods the assets liabilities firm commitments and anticipated transactions which are hedged by derivative financial instruments were excluded from the model the company’s computations are based on the monte carlo simulation utilizing a 95 confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual gains or losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company the var model estimated that there is a 5 chance that the market value of the derivative instruments held as of december 30 2001 will deteriorate due to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations by more than 18 million during the four quarters ended december 30 2001 the var ranged between 025 million and 18 million and averaged approximately 08 million   management periodically reviews its interest rate and foreign currency exposures and evaluates strategies to manage such exposures in the near future the company implements changes when deemed necessary in the management of hedging instruments which mitigate its exposure   since the company utilizes interest rate and foreign currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying transaction   it is the company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above the company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 28 forwardlooking information and factors affecting future performance   this report contains “forwardlooking statements” as defined in section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 for this purpose any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forwardlooking statements words such as “believes” “anticipates” “plans” “expects” “will” and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by these forwardlooking statements including among others the factors set forth below   the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations 

 

   some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical industry downturns often are characterized by reduced product demand excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling prices any significant downturn in our customers’ markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and could harm our business for example in 2001 and with respect to optoelectronics the first quarter of 2002 the operating results of our optoelectronics and fluid sciences segments were adversely affected by the downturn in the telecom photography and semiconductor markets current economic conditions have caused a decrease in capital spending by many of our customers which in turn has adversely affected our revenues and business 

 

   we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements our products could become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors including our ability to    many of our products are used by our customers to develop test and manufacture their products therefore we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products in developing any new product we may be required to make a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product if we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue   in addition some of our life sciences segment’s licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications for example some of our life sciences segment’s license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research and exclude clinical diagnostics applications 

 

   since we sell our products worldwide our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally our revenue originating outside the united states represented 56 of our total sales from continuing operations in the fiscal year ended december 30 2001 we anticipate that sales from international 29 operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in addition many of our manufacturing facilities employees and suppliers are located outside the united states accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

 

   given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability changes in competitive market and economic conditions may cause us to adjust our operations a high proportion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter factors that may affect our quarterly operating results and the market price of our common stock include    in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of specific companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

   one of our strategies is to supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons including  30   some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be marginally profitable or unprofitable accordingly the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations   to finance our acquisitions we may have to raise additional funds either through public or private financings we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms 

 

   we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors to remain competitive we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive in addition new competitors may emerge and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines 

 

   some of the products produced by our life sciences segment are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar international agencies these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sales and distribution if we fail to comply with the fda’s regulations or those of similar international agencies we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution in addition we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 

 

   we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal state local and foreign regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or the cost of producing these products 

 

   patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing and marketing new technologies and products is timeconsuming and expensive we own many us and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents to cover our products we may not obtain issued patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology   third parties may seek to challenge invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to us or claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights   in addition to our patents we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and knowhow and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties the measures employed to protect this technology and these rights may not be adequate moreover some licenses can be terminated or converted to nonexclusive arrangements by the licensor if we fail to meet specified performance targets   we may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties in addition claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from making using or selling our products in the us or abroad 31 

 

   as of december 30 2001 we had 598 million in outstanding longterm indebtedness our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness we may also obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit and issue additional commercial paper to meet future financing needs which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage   our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences including    a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at floating rates as a result our interest payment obligations on such indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase 

 

   as of december 30 2001 our total assets included 15 billion of net intangible assets net intangible assets consist of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights and technology licenses net of accumulated amortization these assets have historically been amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives in connection our adoption of sfas no 142 we will discontinue the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from december 31 2001 instead these items will be tested on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be able to realize the full value assigned to those assets any realization assessment that results in the writeoff of a significant portion of our net intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

   in october 2001 we approved a plan to sell our fluid sciences business our ability to successfully dispose of our fluid sciences business and the price we receive upon any such disposition will be affected by among other things the performance of the fluid sciences business and the ability of prospective buyers to obtain adequate financing the ability of prospective buyers to obtain financing will depend on among other things the state of the capital markets we cannot predict whether we will be able to successfully dispose of our fluid sciences business 32
