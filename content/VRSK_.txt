our history 

 

we trace our history to 1971 when insurance services office inc iso started operations as a notforprofit advisory and rating organization providing services to the us pc insurance industry iso was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators as required by law iso’s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development underwriting and rating functions

regulation 

 

because our business involves the distribution of certain personal public and nonpublic data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility service and marketing decisions based on such data certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws in the us and to a lesser extent in foreign countries examples of such regulation include the fair credit reporting act which regulates the use of consumer credit report information the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of nonpublic personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions the drivers privacy protection act which prohibits the public disclosure use or resale by any state’s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record except for a “permissible purpose” and various other federal state and local laws and regulations

 

those laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used to challenge the accuracy of such information andor to prevent the use and disclosure of such information in certain instances the laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances

 

we are also licensed as a rating rate service advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all 50 states puerto rico guam the us virgin islands and the district of columbia as such an advisory organization we provide statistical actuarial policy language development and related products and services to pc insurers including advisory prospective loss costs other prospective cost information manual rules and policy language we also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policy writing and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators

 

many of our products services and operations as well as insurers use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the mccarranferguson act as a result many of our operations and products are subject to review andor approval by state regulators further our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes which are typically enforced by state attorneys general andor insurance regulators

risk factors 

tableend  

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to invest in any of our securities if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer in such case the trading price of our securities including our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in addition to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in item 7 of part ii managements discussion analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the risk factors below additional or unforeseen effects from the covid19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below 

 

risks related to our business 

 

we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions 

 

we depend upon data from external sources including data received from customers and various government and public record services for information used in our databases in general we do not own the information in these databases and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons and we could also become subject to legislative judicial or contractual restrictions on the use of such data in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way that allows us to legally use andor process the data in addition some of our customers have been and in the future may continue to be stockholders of our company if our customers’ percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases or they cease to be stockholders of our company there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms if a substantial number of data sources or certain key sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows

 

agreements with our data suppliers are shortterm agreements some suppliers are also competitors which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors an advantage such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute data sources

 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from us pc primary insurers if there is a downturn in the us insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions our revenues will decline 

revenues derived from solutions we provide to us pc primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 52 of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to us pc primary insurers also our invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the us pc insurance market which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry that are beyond our control in addition our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions 

factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by pc primary insurers include the following

 

  

a downturn in the insurance industry pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

 

acquisitions other strategic relationships and dispositions of our business and related integration and separation risks could result in operating difficulties and other harmful consequences and we may not be successful in achieving the anticipated benefits of such transactions 

 

our longterm business strategy includes growth through acquisitions and other strategic relationships future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful acquisitions or investments moreover from time to time we may also undertake dispositions of certain businesses or assets any acquisitions investments and dispositions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in such transactions such risks include among other things

 

   

   

the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition

 

we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities although we have capacity under committed facilities those may not be sufficient therefore future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in dilution in addition to the extent we cannot identify or consummate on terms acceptable to us acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth

 

there may be consolidation in our end customer market which could reduce the use of our services 

 

mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon for example in the pc insurance sector any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

 

 

if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions our business could suffer serious harm 

 

our growth and success depend upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions if we are unable to develop new solutions or if we are not successful in introducing andor obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate in addition significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in the past we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions primarily due to difficulties in developing models acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments errors or defects in our solutions that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection of our solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenues diversion of development resources an increase in product liability claims and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims

 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that require significant resource commitments which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 

 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases the demand for some of our solutions may decrease 

 

public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce the demand for our solutions to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources our business and results of operations may be adversely affected

 

our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 

 

our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace

 

however as a general practice we do not enter into employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team except for certain limited situations if we lose key members of our senior management operating team we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers 

 

our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees if our attrition rate increases our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work

 

if our business continues to grow the number of people we will need to hire will increase we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs

 

 

general economic political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business 

 

the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the energy transition driven by climate change and decarbonization the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions

 

we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with future acquisitions  

 

in order to finance acquisitions which are an important part of our longterm growth strategy we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and such increased leverage could adversely affect our business in particular the increased leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue other operational and strategic opportunities the increased leverage potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

general economic uncertainties including downward trends in the energy industry could reduce demand by wood mackenzie’s customers for its products and services 

 

demand for wood mackenzie’s products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties particularly any downward trends in the energy industry and the energy transition driven by climate change and decarbonization many factors could negatively affect the revenues profits and discretionary spending of wood mackenzie’s customers such factors include commodity prices in particular oil and coal the state of the local economy interest rates currency exchange rates political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations the availability of industry resources and other matters a downturn or perceived downturn in the economy particularly the energy industry could add pricing pressure delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by wood mackenzie’s customers which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

 

risks related to our intellectual property and cybersecurity 

 

fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other cybersecurity or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation 

 

security breaches in our facilities computer networks and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers many of our solutions involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data as with other global companies our systems are regularly subject to cyberattacks cyberthreats attempts at fraudulent access physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems as cyberthreats continue to evolve we are required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures and to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities and incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate or detect all security breaches nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyberthreats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate prevent or detect all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss

 

thirdparty contractors including cloudbased service providers also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information if users gain improper access to our databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify confidential thirdparty information that is stored or transmitted on our networks our business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access our network products and services our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks

 

in addition customers’ employees’ or other’s misuse of andor gaining fraudulent or unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers any such misappropriation andor misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us among other things being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation

 

a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways

 

  

incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed or any other security or privacy breaches have in the past occurred and may in the future occur and could go undetected the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is inherently uncertain any such incident could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows in addition media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our thirdparty suppliers even if no breach has been attempted or occurred could also adversely impact our reputation and materially impact our business

 

 

we could face claims for intellectual property infringement which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers 

 

there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings particularly in the us regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry there is a risk that we are infringing or may in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties we have from timetotime been subject to litigation alleging intellectual property infringement we monitor thirdparty patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate however such monitoring and analysis has not been and is unlikely in the future to be comprehensive and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications since the patent application process can take several years to complete there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies as a result we may infringe existing and future thirdparty patents of which we are not aware as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties

 

thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions even if we prevail litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management’s time and attention

 

if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop noninfringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and costeffective basis this could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows

 

we may lose key business assets through the loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links the internet or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 

 

our operations depend on our ability as well as that of thirdparty service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions to protect data centers whether in cloud or dedicated environments and related technology against damage from hardware failure fire flood power loss telecommunications failure impacts of terrorism breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers natural disasters or other disasters certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding earthquakes or other disasters the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers in addition we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time any damage to our or our thirdparty service provider’s data centers failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements resulting in decreased revenue operating income and earnings per share

 

 

 

risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

 

we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them our business could be harmed 

 

our success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights to date we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology this protection of our proprietary technology is limited and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent in addition patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage any disclosure loss invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and ultimately our business our protection of our intellectual property rights in the us or abroad may not be adequate and others including our competitors may use our proprietary technology without our consent furthermore litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

 

because personal public and nonpublic information is stored in some of our databases we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act grammleachbliley act driver’s privacy protection act the european union’s general data protection regulation the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent various other federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace however many consumer advocates privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information particularly social security numbers department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth as a result they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data we have implemented various measures to comply with the data privacy and protection principles of the european union’s general data protection regulation however there can be no assurances that such methods will be deemed fully compliant if we are unable to comply with the data privacy and protection principles adopted pursuant to the general data protection regulation it will impede our ability to conduct business between the us and the eu which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows

 

the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows

 

  

 

 

our financial position may be impacted by audit examinations or changes in tax laws or tax rulings 

 

our existing corporate structure and tax positions have been implemented in a manner in which we believe is compliant with current prevailing tax laws however changes in existing tax laws or rulings including federal state and international could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate cash tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities tax audit examinations with an adverse outcome could have a negative effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate furthermore the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd released its base erosion and profit shifting beps action plans which may also lead to future tax reform that could affect our results in addition our tax positions are impacted by fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries in which we do business

 

we are subject to antitrust consumer protection intellectual property and other litigation as well as governmental investigations and may in the future become further subject to such litigation and investigations an adverse outcome in such litigation or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

 

we participate in businesses particularly insurancerelated businesses and services that are subject to substantial litigation including antitrust consumer protection and intellectual property litigation in addition our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business

 

our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or resolve any governmental investigation could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability given the nature of our business we may be subject to litigation or investigation in the future even if the direct financial impact of such litigation or investigations is not material settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation or investigations could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth

 

 

risks related to international operations 

 

we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively 

 

some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive and are expected to remain highly competitive we compete on the basis of quality customer service product and service selection and pricing our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment due to their size certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can as a result these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences emerging technologies and market trends in addition new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away and as we enter into new lines of business due to acquisition or otherwise we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments especially against larger competitors we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete if we fail to successfully compete our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected

 

our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations 

 

wood mackenzie is based in the united kingdom and conducts its principal operations outside the us conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws legal standards regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers unexpected changes in regulatory requirements taxes trade laws tariffs export quotas custom duties or other trade restrictions differing technology standards difficulties in collecting accounts receivable difficulties in managing and staffing international operations varying expectations as to employee standards potentially adverse tax consequences including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries in addition our international operations subject us to obligations associated with anticorruption laws and regulations such as the uk bribery act 2010 the us foreign corrupt practices act and regulations established by the us office of foreign assets control government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of export controls anticorruption laws or regulations and other laws rules sanctions embargoes and regulations

 

moreover international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war and other economic or political uncertainties all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations 

 

as a result of our acquisition of wood mackenzie and other recent acquisitions outside of the us we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies as exchange rates vary revenue cost of revenue operating expenses and other operating results when remeasured in us dollars may differ materially from expectations although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own such as ongoing management time and expertise external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications

 

 

risks related to our common stock 

 

if there are substantial sales of our common stock our stock price could decline 

 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive as of december 31 2021 our ten largest shareholders owned 361 of our common stock including 26 of our common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration and subject to limitations on the timing amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly in addition the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock

 

pursuant to our equity incentive plans options to purchase approximately 5608239 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 18 2022 we filed a registration statement under the securities act which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans including for such outstanding options as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline

 

also in the future we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock

 

our capital structure level of indebtedness and the terms of antitakeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors 

 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so our certificate of incorporation and bylaws

 

  

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us as a public company we are subject to section 203 which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 150 or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions but we do not intend to do so

 

these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future

covid19 

 

since january 2020 an outbreak of covid19 has evolved into a worldwide pandemic we have modified our operations in line with our business continuity plans due to covid19 while our facilities generally remain open we are making extensive use of the workfromhome model at this moment on a daily basis management is reviewing our operations and there have been to date minimal interruptions in our customerfacing operations given the digital nature of our business and the move toward cloud enablement we expect to remain operationally stable an d fully available to our customers we are in compliance with all financial and nonfinancial covenants and have not observed a loss of any significant customers a significant deterioration in the collectability of receivables a significant reduction in our liquidity nor a significant decline in the subscription renewal rates 

 

we have analyzed our solutions and services to assess the impact of covid19 on our revenue streams we have not identified any material impact stemming from covid19 on approximately 85 of our revenues at this point as much of these revenues are subscription in nature and subject to longterm contracts these revenues grew approximately 6 for the year ended december 31 2021 

 

of the remaining 15 we have identified specific solutions and services largely transactional in nature that are being impacted by covid19 the primary causal factors are lower auto and travel insurance activity the inability to enter commercial buildings to perform engineering analyses decreased capital expenditure in the energy sector and reduced levels of advertising by financial institutions and marketers the portion of our revenue that is attributable to these solutions has been negatively impacted by covid19 beginning in march 2020 with the onset of the pandemic these revenues increased approximately 1 for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 as the global outbreak of covid19 continues to evolve management continues to closely monitor its impact on our business

 

 

recent developments 

 

as of december 31 2021 we reassessed the recoverability of the longlived assets for our financial services reporting unit based upon the weaker than expected operating performance as a result of changing market conditions these conditions constituted a triggering event which resulted in a 1340 million impairment to the longlived assets for our financial services reporting unit including 882 million to intangible assets and 458 million to fixed assets we based our analysis of the fair value of our longlived assets on the indication of fair value provided by the offer to purchase such reporting unit which was approved by our board of directors on february 16 2022 this impairment is included within other operating loss income in our accompanying consolidated statement of operations

 

on january 12 2022 our board of directors approved the action to make our environmental health and safety business within the energy  specialized markets segment available for immediate sale at its current fair value on january 21 2022 we entered into a stock purchase agreement the “purchase agreement” to sell 3e company environmental ecological and engineering 3e to tamarack buyer llc “buyer” in exchange for a potential aggregate cash consideration of up to 9500 million buyer is an entity that was formed on behalf of and is controlled by certain investment funds affiliated with new mountain capital llc “new mountain”

 

the purchase price consists of 6300 million of cash consideration to be paid at the closing of the transaction subject to customary purchase price adjustments for among other things the cash working capital and indebtedness of 3e as of the closing up to 500 million of earnout payments based on 3e’s financial performance in 2023 and 2024 and up to 2700 million of additional deferred payments based on new mountain’s future return on its investment in 3e

 

buyer has secured financing consisting of equity financing to be provided by certain investment funds affiliated with new mountain and committed debt financing to consummate the transaction the closing of the transaction is not subject to a financing condition but is subject to other customary conditions including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino act there can be no assurance that these closing conditions will be satisfied

 

the purchase agreement contains representations warranties and covenants of the parties that are customary for transactions of this type and that are subject in some cases to specified exceptions and qualifications until the consummation of the transaction we have agreed subject to certain exceptions to conduct 3e’s business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice the parties are required to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions necessary proper or advisable under applicable laws to consummate the transaction we will enter into a transition services agreement with buyer at the closing of the transaction to ensure an orderly transition

 

on february 11 2022 we acquired 100 percent of the membership interest of infutor data solutions llc infutor for an aggregate net cash consideration of 2235 million of which 15 million represents a working capital escrow plus a contingent earnout payment of up to 250 million subject to the achievement of certain revenue and other performance targets infutor a leading provider of identity resolution and consumer intelligence data has become a part of the underwriting  rating category within our insurance segment we believe this acquisition further enhances verisk’s marketing solutions offerings to companies across several industries including the insurance industry 

 

on february 16 2022 our board of directors approved the action to make our financial services business within the financial services segment available for immediate sale at its current fair value on february 21 2022 we entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell our financial services business to transunion a global information and insights company for 5150 million in cash consideration paid at closing this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals and working capital adjustments

 

executive summary 

 

key performance metrics 

 

revenue growth  we use yearoveryear revenue growth as a key performance metric we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers sales to new customers sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses

 

we believe our business’s ability to grow recurring revenue and generate positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy we use yearoveryear revenue and ebitda growth as metrics to measure our performance ebitda and ebitda margin are nongaap financial measures ebitda is defined as net income before interest expense provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets we calculate ebitda margin as ebitda divided by revenues the respective nearest applicable gaap financial measures are net income and net income margin although ebitda is a nongaap financial measure ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of companies ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating income net income or cash flow from operating activities reported under gaap management uses ebitda and ebitda margin in conjunction with traditional gaap operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment company performance we believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources make business decisions allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance and facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons some of these limitations involved in the use of ebitda are 

 

• ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments

 

• ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs

 

• although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements

 

• other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda differently than we do limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure

 

ebitda growth  we use ebitda growth as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth ebitda growth allows for greater transparency regarding our operating performance and facilitate periodtoperiod comparison

 

ebitda margin we use ebitda margin as a performance measure to assess segment performance and scalability of our business we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth

 

 

revenues 

 

we earn revenues through agreements for hosted subscriptions advisoryconsulting services and for transactional solutions recurring and nonrecurring subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year as a result the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period in general we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business

 

approxi mately 81 and 82 of the revenues in our insurance segment for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 were derived from hosted subscriptions through agreements generally one to five years for our solutions respectively our customers in this segment include most of the pc insurance providers in the us approximately 83 and 85 of the revenues in our energy and specialized markets segment for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 were derived from hosted subscriptions with longterm agreements for our solutions respectively our customers in this segment include most of the top 10 global energy providers around the world approximately 83 and 77 of the revenues in our financial services segment for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 were derived from subscriptions with longterm agreements for our solutions respectively our customers in this segment include financial institutions payment networks and processors alternative lenders regulators merchants and the top 30 credit card issuers in north america the united kingdom and australia 

 

we also provide advisoryconsulting services which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions in addition certain of our solutions are paid for by our customers on a transactional basis recurring and nonrecurring for example we have solutions that allow our customers to access propertyspecific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building or compare a pc insurance or a workers compensation claim with information in our databases or use our repair cost estimation solutions on a casebycase basis for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020  approximately 19 and 18 respectively of our consolidated revenues were derived from providing transactional and advisoryconsulting solutions 

 

 

principal operating costs and expenses 

 

personnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses which represented approximately 55 and 59 of our total operating expenses for each of the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively include salaries benefits incentive compensation equity compensation costs sales commissions employment taxes recruiting costs and outsourced temporary agency costs

 

we assign personnel expenses between two categories cost of revenues and selling general and administrative costs based on the actual costs associated with each employee we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues and all other personnel including executive managers salespeople marketing business development finance legal human resources and administrative services as selling general and administrative expenses a significant portion of our other operating costs such as facilities and communications are either captured within cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed

 

while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues historically our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses however part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions and new businesses which may offset margin expansion

 

cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our nextgeneration solutions our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization

 

selling general and administrative expense our selling general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities insurance and communications are allocated to selling general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee our selling general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization

 

 

trends affecting our business 

 

we serve customers in three primary vertical markets pc insurance energy and specialized markets and financial services the industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business 

 

a significant change in pc insurers’ profitability could affect the demand for our solutions for insurers the keys to profitability include increasing investment income premium growth and disciplined underwriting of risks investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates growth in pc insurers’ direct written premiums is cyclical with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 148 in 2002 to a trough of negative 31 in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 44 in 2012 slowing down to 37 in 2015 and 2016 accelerating to 47 in 2017 and 55 in 2018 then again slowing down to 51 in 2019 in recent years we have signed multiyear contracts with certain customers and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multiyear period pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years premiums direct premium growth slowed to 23 in 2020 due to covid19 pandemic and premiums for personal automobile insurance actually declined based on the most recent results available direct premium growth recovered in 2021 despite continuing disruptions and uncertainties associated with the covid19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 insurers were also challenged by heightened catastrophic losses associated with a record number of events isos property claims service classified as catastrophes in each of the years the catastrophes of 2020 included the hurricane laura and the midwest derecho both in august 2020 and multiple wildfires in the western states while the most notable events of 2021 included the winter storm in february that left much of texas without power and hurricane ida in august both ida and laura are among the strongest hurricanes to ever make landfall in the united states these events illustrate the need for broader coverages such as flood to meet the changing needs of communities we continue to provide the necessary resources to meet insurer needs in the life insurance market carriers are looking to modernize and digitize their core platforms as well as offer streamlined underwriting decisionmaking process to expand the number of policies which can be offered more rapidly and without cumbersome medical tests our nocode modular technology stack and advanced analytics such as using electronic health records to model mortality and detecting of tobacco use through voice analysis enable the digital transformation of our customers core infrastructure and automate their decisionmaking processes across the policy lifecycle 

 

trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe losses such as from weather climate cyber casualty terrorism pandemics and tsunamis can have an effect on our customers’ profitability and therefore on their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of these events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling catastrophe loss information and repair cost solutions likewise any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products we also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity the need by our customers to fight insurance fraud  both in claims and at policy inception  could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions 

 

trends in the energy chemicals metals and mining sectors and activity in financial markets can influence our revenues in 2021 global economic growth commodity flows and prices recovered strongly after being impacted negatively by the covid19 pandemic in 2020 commodity markets performed impressively with brent oil averaging 71 dollars per barrel in 2021 compared to an average of 42 dollars per barrel in 2020 gas prices also increased from their 2020 levels as global energy demand recovered investment in the natural resources increased in 2021 following a sharp decline in 2020 we expect investment to continue to increase this year as natural resources companies reinvest the higher cashflows generated from their operations as a result of the significantly higher commodity prices seen in 2021 however natural resources companies are also expected to demonstrate capital discipline using higher commodity prices as an opportunity to build stronger balance sheets and to return capital to shareholders the energy transition continues to gather pace governments and companies in all areas of our customer base globally are setting targets for the reduction in co2 emissions and are adjusting their investment plans to take into account expected changes in energy demand regulation and consumer behavior the transition presents both a threat and an opportunity for the sector and our revenues fossil fuels will meet much of global demand for some decades but investments in zero carbon energy renewables and emerging technologies such as electric vehicles and energy storage and the associated infrastructure will grow in importance electrification of economies will drive demand for base metals some bulk commodities and battery raw materials climate change and decarbonization are rising up the agenda and policy on environmental and social governance is intensifying attracting the capital needed to meet future energy demand is one of the industry’s challenges and data analysis and insight will help our customers achieve this 

 

trends in the banking and retail sectors as well as material external factors can influence revenues in our financial services segment in many ways covid19 has had a significant impact on our onetime consultative revenue streams over the past year as our clients sought to temporarily reduce external expenditure while they focused on critical customer needs additionally governmental intervention and actions to support indebted consumers by extending credit terms has created a lag in bankruptcy and similar filings which have adversely impacted our credit analytics business but we do believe this is a temporary impact which will reverse over time as retailers saw reduced consumer spend due to covid19 however this created an opportunity for our spend analytics businesses to work more closely with retailers to help them understand and target emerging spend as the economies in our markets reemerged our sector specific trends have remained broadly consistent with fraud and similar financial crimes continuing to impact our customers in ways ranging from regulatory risk and credit loss for financial institutions to counterfeit loss and inventory shrinkage for merchants with risks being elevated at times of financial stress this can strengthen demand for our credit risk and fraud solutions ranging from enhanced brand protection solutions for retailers through to enhanced artificialintelligence led models to identify cross bank and crossborder fraudulent transactions we continue to see increasing competition for traditional retail banks and consumer lenders from financial technology companies and other online lending new entrants which provides opportunities for us to support many existing and potential clients with our enhanced digital solutions and analytical tools providing new ways for us to communicate and engage with our clients today in our remote environment and in the future

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and intangible assets pension and other postretirement benefits stockbased compensation and income taxes actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions

 

revenue recognition 

 

we recognize revenue based on the transfer of promised goods or services to customers for the amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services revenue is recognized in a fivestep model 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation revenues for hosted subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term revenues from certain discrete project based advisoryconsulting services are recognized over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation based on the input method of consulting hours worked this aligns with the results achieved and value transferred to the customer revenues from transactional solutions are recognized as the solutions are delivered or services performed at point in time

 

we invoice our customers in annual quarterly or monthly installments amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenues on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met

 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

stockbased compensation cost including stock options restricted stock and performance share units psus is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period the fair value of stock options is measured using a blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the use of several estimates including expected term expected riskfree interest rate expected volatility and expected dividend yield the fair value of the restricted stock is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date the fair value of psus is determined on the grant date using the monte carlo simulation model

 

option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the fouryear vesting period psus are generally expensed ratably over the threeyear vesting period we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1 2005 which requires that stockbased compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service

 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate

 

goodwill and intangibles 

 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets  this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value

 

as of december 31 2021 we had goodwill of 43312 million which represents 555 of our to tal assets during 2021 we performed an impairment test as of june 30 2021 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing including an estimate of future expected revenues ebitda ebitda margins and cash flows useful lives and discount rates and an estimate of value using multiples derived from the stock prices of publicly traded guideline companies applied to such expected cash flows and market approaches in order to estimate fair value we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units to mitigate undue influence we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill as of december 31 2021 we reassessed the recoverability of longlived assets for our financial services reporting unit based upon the weaker than expected operating performance as a result of changing market conditions these conditions constituted a triggering event which resulted in a 1340 million impairment to the longlived assets in our financial services operating segment including 882 million to intangible assets and 458 million to fixed assets we based our analysis of the fair value of our longlived assets on the indication of fair value provided by the offer to purchase such reporting unit which was approved by our board of directors on february 16 2022 this impairment is included within other operating loss income in our accompanying consolidated statement of operations please refer to note 9  fixed assets and note 12  goodwill and intangible assets for more information

 

we allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets the estimates used in valuing the intangible assets are determined with the assistance of thirdparty specialists a discounted cash flow analysis and estimates made by management management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings

 

income taxes 

 

in projecting future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions

 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of asc 740  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this interpretation we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position

 

we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined

 

 

 

we estimate unrecognized tax positions o f 06   million that may be recognized by december 31 2022 due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities net of additional uncertain tax positions

 

as of december 31 2021 we have gross federal state and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforw ards of 1546 milli on which will expire at various dates from 2022 through 2041 such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows

 

  

the net deferred income tax lia bility of 4639 million consists primarily of timing differences involving amortization

we have started to consider the implications of the transition of libor to alternative reference rate measures that will likely become effective post december 2021 we believe that there is still some uncertainty over what these rates will be but one possibility for us dollar libor would be the secured overnight financing rate sofr as this decision has not been finalized at the time of amending our credit facility agreement there is no definitive alternative rate proposed in the current contract we are however reviewing the potential impact on the application of this rate on our interest expense once it becomes applicable as our only current contract extending beyond 2021 that is subject to the libor rate is the credit facility the impact will be dependent on what the outstanding borrowing amount is on the credit facility and the relevant interest rate that will be contractually applicable should we amend our credit facility to reflect sofr based on recent borrowings and applicable sofr we do not anticipate to have a material impact on the business

 

foreign currency risk 

 

our foreignbased businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates a portion of our revenue is denominated in british pounds and other foreign currencies if the us dollar strengthens against british pounds and other foreign currencies our revenues reported in us dollars would decline with regard to operating expense our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in british pounds and other foreign currencies if british pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen costs reported in us dollars will increase movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 a hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings

our history 

 

we trace our history to 1971 when insurance services office inc iso started operations as a notforprofit advisory and rating organization providing services to the us pc insurance industry iso was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators as required by law iso’s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development underwriting and rating functions

when we find it advantageous we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings this approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows

 

 

 

sales marketing and customer support 

 

we sell our solutions and services primarily through direct interaction with our customers we employ a threetier sales structure that includes salespeople technical consultants and sales support within our company several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services those specialized sales teams sell specific highly technical solution sets to targeted markets in coordination with account management

 

to provide account management to our largest customers in the insurance energy and financial markets we divide our customers into three groups tier one “globalnational accounts comprises our largest customers tier two “strategic accounts represents both large and middlemarket customer groups tier three is composed of small and specialized companies that may represent one line of business may be regionally focused or are recent new entrants into the marketplace in tier one and tier two segments we have sales teams organized by the following specialties personal or commercial lines underwriting and pricing claims catastrophe risk and energy in the tier three segment we assign a sales generalist with overall account management responsibility our tiered approach has proven to be a successful sales model and approach to building customer relationships our senior executives regularly engage with the senior management of our customers to ensure customer satisfaction and strategic alignment and to support mutual partnership innovation opportunities

 

salespeople participate in both sales and customer service activities they provide direct support interacting frequently with assigned customers to ensure a satisfactory experience using our services salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various product teams to coordinate sales activities and ensure our solutions fit the customers needs we believe our salespeople’s product knowledge skills to develop relationships of trust and local presence differentiate us from our competition technical consultants are subject matter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products and segments salespeople manage the overall sales process and technical consultants manage the rigorous integration and functional fit discussions to ensure mutual success and satisfaction both salespeople and technical consultants have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities a team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination among the groups

 

sources of our data 

 

the data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions is sourced through seven different kinds of data arrangements first we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created from their data those agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out it is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data second we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide their required levels of privacy protection of data and where necessary deidentification of data the agreements represent no cost to us generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and require renewal third we “mine” data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions as an example we use the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models again those arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way fourth we source data generally at no cost from public sources including federal state and local governments fifth we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff members who also perform property surveys at the request of and facilitated by property insurers sixth we collect data or license or purchase from third parties on geographic and spatially referenced information relating to residential and commercial structures by using the latest remote sensing and machine learning technologies lastly we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased including county tax assessor records descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses we are the owners of the derivative solutions we create using the data we collect

regulation 

 

because our business involves the distribution of certain personal public and nonpublic data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility service and marketing decisions based on such data certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws in the us and to a lesser extent in foreign countries examples of such regulation include the fair credit reporting act which regulates the use of consumer credit report information the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of nonpublic personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions the drivers privacy protection act which prohibits the public disclosure use or resale by any state’s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record except for a “permissible purpose” and various other federal state and local laws and regulations

 

those laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used to challenge the accuracy of such information andor to prevent the use and disclosure of such information in certain instances the laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances

many of our products services and operations as well as insurers use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the mccarranferguson act as a result many of our operations and products are subject to review andor approval by state regulators further our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes which are typically enforced by state attorneys general andor insurance regulators

risk factors 

tableend  

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to invest in any of our securities if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer in such case the trading price of our securities including our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in addition to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in item 7 of part ii managements discussion analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the risk factors below additional or unforeseen effects from the covid19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below 

 

risks related to our business 

 

we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions 

 

we depend upon data from external sources including data received from customers and various government and public record services for information used in our databases in general we do not own the information in these databases and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons and we could also become subject to legislative judicial or contractual restrictions on the use of such data in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way that allows us to legally use andor process the data in addition some of our customers have been and in the future may continue to be stockholders of our company if our customers’ percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases or they cease to be stockholders of our company there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms if a substantial number of data sources or certain key sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows

 

agreements with our data suppliers are shortterm agreements some suppliers are also competitors which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors an advantage such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute data sources

 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from us pc primary insurers if there is a downturn in the us insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions our revenues will decline 

revenues derived from solutions we provide to us pc primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 51 of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to us pc primary insurers also our invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the us pc insurance market which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry that are beyond our control in addition our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions 

factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by pc primary insurers include the following

 

  

a downturn in the insurance industry pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

acquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions 

 

our longterm business strategy includes growth through acquisitions future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful acquisitions or investments any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in the acquisitions of businesses such risks include among other things

 

  14 

 

   

the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition

 

we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities although we have capacity under committed facilities those may not be sufficient therefore future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in dilution

 

in addition to the extent we cannot identify or consummate on terms acceptable to us acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth

 

there may be consolidation in our end customer market which could reduce the use of our services 

 

mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon for example in the pc insurance sector any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

 

if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions our business could suffer serious harm 

 

our growth and success depend upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions if we are unable to develop new solutions or if we are not successful in introducing andor obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate in addition significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in the past we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions primarily due to difficulties in developing models acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments errors or defects in our solutions that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection of our solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenues diversion of development resources an increase in product liability claims and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims

 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that require significant resource commitments which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 

 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

 

to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases the demand for some of our solutions may decrease 

 

public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce the demand for our solutions to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources our business and results of operations may be adversely affected

 

our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 

 

our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace

 

however as a general practice we do not enter into employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team except for certain limited situations if we lose key members of our senior management operating team we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers 

 

our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees if our attrition rate increases our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work

 

if our business continues to grow the number of people we will need to hire will increase we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs

 

general economic political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business 

 

the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions

 

we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with future acquisitions  

 

in order to finance acquisitions which are an important part of our longterm growth strategy we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and such increased leverage could adversely affect our business in particular the increased leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue other operational and strategic opportunities the increased leverage potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

general economic uncertainties including downward trends in the energy industry could reduce demand by wood mackenzie’s customers for its products and services 

 

demand for wood mackenzie’s products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties particularly any downward trends in the energy industry many factors could negatively affect the revenues profits and discretionary spending of wood mackenzie’s customers such factors include commodity prices in particular oil and coal the state of the local economy interest rates currency exchange rates political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations the availability of industry resources and other matters a downturn or perceived downturn in the economy particularly the energy industry could add pricing pressure delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by wood mackenzie’s customers which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

 

 

 

risks related to our intellectual property and cybersecurity 

 

fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other cybersecurity or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation 

 

security breaches in our facilities computer networks and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers many of our solutions involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data as with other global companies our systems are regularly subject to cyberattacks cyberthreats physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems as cyberthreats continue to evolve we are required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures and to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities and incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate or detect all security breaches nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyberthreats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate prevent or detect all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss although we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyberincidents no cyberattack or other cyberincident has to our knowledge had a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations to date

 

thirdparty contractors including cloudbased service providers also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information if users gain improper access to our databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify confidential thirdparty information that is stored or transmitted on our networks our business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access our network products and services our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks

 

in addition customers’ employees’ or other’s misuse of andor gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers any such misappropriation andor misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us among other things being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation

 

a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways

 

  

incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed or any other security or privacy breaches may occur and could go undetected the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown any such incident could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows in addition media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our thirdparty suppliers even if no breach has been attempted or occurred could also adversely impact our reputation and materially impact our business

 

we could face claims for intellectual property infringement which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers 

 

there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings particularly in the us regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry there is a risk that we are infringing or may in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties we have from timetotime been subject to litigation alleging intellectual property infringement we monitor thirdparty patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate however such monitoring and analysis has not been and is unlikely in the future to be comprehensive and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications since the patent application process can take several years to complete there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies as a result we may infringe existing and future thirdparty patents of which we are not aware as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties

 

thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions even if we prevail litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management’s time and attention

 

if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop noninfringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and costeffective basis this could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows

 

we may lose key business assets through the loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links the internet or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 

 

our operations depend on our ability as well as that of thirdparty service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions to protect data centers whether in cloud or dedicated environments and related technology against damage from hardware failure fire flood power loss telecommunications failure impacts of terrorism breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers natural disasters or other disasters certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding earthquakes or other disasters the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers in addition we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time any damage to our or our thirdparty service provider’s data centers failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements resulting in decreased revenue operating income and earnings per share

 

 

 

 

risks related to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

 

we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them our business could be harmed 

 

our success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights to date we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology this protection of our proprietary technology is limited and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent in addition patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage any disclosure loss invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and ultimately our business our protection of our intellectual property rights in the us or abroad may not be adequate and others including our competitors may use our proprietary technology without our consent furthermore litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

 

because personal public and nonpublic information is stored in some of our databases we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act grammleachbliley act driver’s privacy protection act the european union’s general data protection regulation the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent various other federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace however many consumer advocates privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information particularly social security numbers department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth as a result they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data we have implemented various measures to comply with the data privacy and protection principles of the european union’s general data protection regulation however there can be no assurances that such methods will be deemed fully compliant if we are unable to comply with the data privacy and protection principles adopted pursuant to the general data protection regulation it will impede our ability to conduct business between the us and the eu which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows

 

the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows

 

  

our financial position may be impacted by audit examinations or changes in tax laws or tax rulings 

 

our existing corporate structure and tax positions have been implemented in a manner in which we believe is compliant with current prevailing tax laws however changes in existing tax laws or rulings including federal state and international could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate cash tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities audit examinations with an adverse outcome could have a negative effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate furthermore the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd released its base erosion and profit shifting beps action plans which may also lead to future tax reform that could affect our results in addition our tax positions are impacted by fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries in which we do business

 

we are subject to antitrust consumer protection and other litigation and may in the future become further subject to such litigation an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

 

we participate in businesses particularly insurancerelated businesses and services that are subject to substantial litigation including antitrust and consumer protection litigation in addition our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability given the nature of our business we may be subject to litigation in the future even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth

 

in the xactware solutions inc patent litigation on february 16 2021 the united states district court for the district of new jersey granted the plaintiffs motion for enhanced damages and attorneys fees the court trebled the jurys award of 1250 million awarding enhanced damages for a total of 3750 million and also awarded the plaintiff prejudgment and postjudgment interest following the outcome of the trial in 2019 we established a 1250 million reserve in connection with this litigation since our appeal to the federal circuit remains pending it is not reasonably possible to determine the ultimate resolution of this matter at this time while the ultimate resolution of this matter remains uncertain at this time should our appeal be unsuccessful there is a risk that we could incur additional expenses up to the amount by which the enhanced damages award plus prejudgment and postjudgment interest and attorneys fees exceeds the existing 1250 million reserve see note 21  to the consolidated financial statements 

 

 

 

risks related to international operations 

 

we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively 

 

some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive and are expected to remain highly competitive we compete on the basis of quality customer service product and service selection and pricing our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment due to their size certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can as a result these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences emerging technologies and market trends in addition new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away and as we enter into new lines of business due to acquisition or otherwise we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments especially against larger competitors we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete if we fail to successfully compete our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected

 

our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations 

 

wood mackenzie is based in the united kingdom uk and conducts its principal operations outside the us as a result the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the us has increased materially conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws legal standards regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers unexpected changes in regulatory requirements taxes trade laws tariffs export quotas custom duties or other trade restrictions differing technology standards difficulties in collecting accounts receivable difficulties in managing and staffing international operations varying expectations as to employee standards potentially adverse tax consequences including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries moreover international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war and other economic or political uncertainties all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations 

 

the revenues and costs of wood mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling as a result of our acquisition of wood mackenzie and other recent acquisitions outside of the us we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies as exchange rates vary revenue cost of revenue operating expenses and other operating results when remeasured in us dollars may differ materially from expectations although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own such as ongoing management time and expertise external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications

 

economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the uk’s exit from the eu could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the results of the referendum on june 23 2016 in the uk to exit the eu which is commonly referred to as “brexit” and to potentially significantly change the uk’s relationship with the eu and the laws and regulations impacting business conducted between the uk and eu countries could disrupt the overall stability of the eu given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual eu countries and negatively impact our european operations an immediate consequence of the brexit vote was an adverse impact to global markets including currency markets which experienced a sharp drop in the value of the british pound longer term the ongoing uncertainty regarding the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu could result in the uk losing access to certain aspects of the single eu market and the global trade deals negotiated by the eu on behalf of its members while the uk formally exited the eu on january 31 2020 uncertainty remains as to the process and future relationship between the uk and the eu the brexit process and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the uk may adversely affect business activity political stability and economic conditions in the uk the eu and elsewhere the impact of which could have an adverse effect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

 

 

risks related to our common stock 

 

if there are substantial sales of our common stock our stock price could decline 

 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive as of december 31 2020 our ten largest shareholders owned 393 of our common stock including 31 of our common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration and subject to limitations on the timing amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly in addition the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock

 

pursuant to our equity incentive plans options to purchase approximately 6210845 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 19 2021 we filed a registration statement under the securities act which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans including for such outstanding options as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline

 

also in the future we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock

 

our capital structure level of indebtedness and the terms of antitakeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors 

 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so our certificate of incorporation and bylaws

 

  

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us as a public company we are subject to section 203 which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 150 or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions but we do not intend to do so

 

these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future

covid19 

 

since january 2020 an outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus covid19 has evolved into a worldwide pandemic we have modified our operations in line with our business continuity plans due to covid19 while our facilities generally remain open we are making extensive use of the workfromhome model at this moment on a daily basis management is reviewing our operations and there have been to date minimal interruptions in our customer facing operations given the digital nature of our business and the move toward cloud enablement we expect to remain operationally stable and fully available to our customers we are in compliance with all financial and nonfinancial covenants and have not observed a loss of any significant customers a significant deterioration in the collectability of receivables a significant reduction in our liquidity nor a significant decline in the subscription renewal rates

 

we have analyzed our solutions and services to assess the impact of covid19 on our revenue streams we have not identified any material impact stemming from covid19 on approximately 85 of our revenues at this point as much of these revenues are subscription in nature and subject to longterm contracts these revenues grew approximately 6 for the year ended december 31 2020

 

of the remaining 15 we have identified specific solutions and services largely transactional in nature that are being impacted by covid19 the primary causal factors are lower auto and travel insurance activity the inability to enter commercial buildings to perform engineering analyses decreased capital expenditure in the energy sector and reduced levels of advertising by financial institutions and marketers the portion of our revenue that is attributable to these solutions has been negatively impacted by covid19 and declined approximately 11 for the year ended december 31 2020 the deepest impacts were in the categories of travel insurance analytics auto underwriting and claims analytics in the insurance industry consulting services in the energy industry and spend informed analytic solutions in financial services although we have experienced a decline in revenue attributable to these specific solutions during the last two weeks of march 2020 and through the period ended december 31 2020 currently we do not anticipate lasting impacts of a material nature to our longterm growth profile as the global outbreak of covid19 is still rapidly evolving management continues to closely monitor its impact on our business

 

 

 

 

executive summary 

 

key performance metrics 

 

we believe our business’s ability to grow recurring revenue and generate positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy we use yearoveryear revenue and ebitda growth as metrics to measure our performance ebitda and ebitda margin are nongaap financial measures see note 3 within item 6 selected financial data section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the respective gaap financial measures are net income and net income margin

 

revenue growth we use yearoveryear revenue growth as a key performance metric we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers sales to new customers sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses

 

ebitda growth  we use ebitda growth as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth ebitda growth allows for greater transparency regarding our operating performance and facilitate periodtoperiod comparison

 

ebitda margin we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth

 

revenues 

 

we earn revenues through agreements for hosted subscriptions advisoryconsulting services and for transactional solutions recurring and nonrecurring subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year as a result the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period in general we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business

 

approxi mately 82 of the revenues in our insurance segment for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 were derived from hosted subscriptions through agreements generally one to five years for our solutions our customers in this segment include most of the pc insurance providers in the us approximately 84 and 78 of the revenues in our energy and specialized markets segment for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019  respectively were derived from hosted subscriptions with longterm agreements for our solutions our customers in this segment include most of the top 10 global energy providers around the world approximately 77 and 72 of the revenues in our financial services segment for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019  respectively were derived from subscriptions with longterm agreements for our solutions respectively our customers in this segment include financial institutions payment networks and processors alternative lenders regulators merchants and the top 30 credit card issuers in north america the united kingdom and australia 

 

we also provide advisoryconsulting services which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions in addition certain of our solutions are paid for by our customers on a transactional basis recurring and nonrecurring for example we have solutions that allow our customers to access propertyspecific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building or compare a pc insurance or a workers compensation claim with information in our databases or use our repair cost estimation solutions on a casebycase basis for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 approximatel y 18 and 19  of our consolidated revenues were derived from providing transactional and advisoryconsulting solutions respectively

 

principal operating costs and expenses 

 

personnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses which represented approximately 59  and 52 of ou r total operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively include salaries benefits incentive compensation equity compensation costs sales commissions employment taxes recruiting costs and outsourced temporary agency costs

 

we assign personnel expenses between two categories cost of revenues and selling general and administrative costs based on the actual costs associated with each employee we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues and all other personnel including executive managers salespeople marketing business development finance legal human resources and administrative services as selling general and administrative expenses a significant portion of our other operating costs such as facilities and communications are either captured within cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed

 

while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues historically our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses however part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions and new businesses which may offset margin expansion

 

cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our nextgeneration solutions our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization

 

selling general and administrative expense our selling general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities insurance and communications are allocated to selling general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee our selling general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization

 

 

 

trends affecting our business 

 

we serve customers in three primary vertical markets pc insurance energy and specialized markets and financial services the industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business

 

a significant change in pc insurers’ profitability could affect the demand for our solutions for insurers the keys to profitability include increasing investment income premium growth and disciplined underwriting of risks investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates growth in pc insurers’ direct written premiums is cyclical with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 148 in 2002 to a trough of negative 31 in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 44 in 2012 slowing down to 37 in 2015 and 2016 accelerating to 47 in 2017 and 55 in 2018 then again slowing down to 51 in 2019 in recent years we have signed multiyear contracts with certain customers and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multiyear period pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years premiums based on the most recent results available direct premium growth and net premium growth slowed down significantly in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic in 2020 insurers were also challenged by heightened catastrophic losses in 2020 associated with a record number of events isos property claims service classified as catastrophes including a major hurricane laura and the midwest derecho both in august 2020 and multiple wildfires in the western states these events illustrate the need for broader coverages such as flood to meet the changing needs of communities we continue to provide the necessary resources to meet insurer needs in the life insurance market carriers are looking to modernize and digitize their core platforms as well as offer streamlined underwriting decisionmaking process to expand the number of policies which can be offered more rapidly and without cumbersome medical tests our nocode modular technology stack and advanced analytics such as using electronic health records to model mortality and detecting of tobacco use through voice analysis enable the digital transformation of our customers core infrastructure and automate their decisionmaking processes across the policy lifecycle

 

trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers’ profitability and therefore on their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of weather events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling catastrophe loss information and repair cost solutions likewise any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from the recent influx of alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products we also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity the need by our customers to fight insurance fraud  both in claims and at policy inception  could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions

 

trends in the energy chemicals metals and mining sectors and activity in financial markets can influence our revenues the covid19 pandemic had a major impact on global economic growth commodity flows and prices in 2020 commodity markets in energy were disrupted with a negative impact on most of our major energy customers brent oil averaged 42 dollar per barrel in 2020 and a monthly low of 19 dollars per barrel in april down from 64 dollar per barrel in 2019 the downcycle in globally traded gas prices was exacerbated by weaker demand investment in the natural resources sector fell sharply as companies cut expenditure we expect investment to increase with the recovery in the global economy though the natural resources industry will continue to demonstrate tight capital discipline which may affect our business the energy transition is gathering pace with china japan south korea and canada among the latest countries committing to net carbon neutral targets in 2020 the transition presents both a threat and an opportunity for the sector and our revenues fossil fuels will meet much of global demand for some decades but investments in zero carbon energy renewables and emerging technologies such as electric vehicles and energy storage and the associated infrastructure will grow in importance electrification of economies will drive demand for base metals some bulk commodities and battery raw materials climate change and decarbonization are rising up the agenda and policy on environmental and social governance is intensifying attracting the capital needed to meet future energy demand is one of the industry’s challenges and data analysis and insight will help our customers achieve this

 

trends in the banking and retail sectors as well as material external factors can influence revenues in our financial services segment in many ways covid19 has had a significant impact on our onetime consultative revenue streams over the past year as our clients sought to temporary reduce external expenditure while they focused on critical customer needs additionally governmental intervention and actions to support indebted consumers by extending credit terms has created a lag in bankruptcy and similar filings which have adversely impacted our credit analytics business but we do believe this is a temporary impact which will reverse over time as retailers saw reduced consumer spend due to covid19 however this created an opportunity for our spend analytics businesses to work more closely with retailers to help them understand and target emerging spend as the economies in our markets reemerged our sector specific trends have remained broadly consistent with fraud and similar financial crimes continuing to impact our customers in ways ranging from regulatory risk and credit loss for financial institutions to counterfeit loss and inventory shrinkage for merchants with risks being elevated at times of financial stress this can strengthen demand for our credit risk and fraud solutions ranging from enhanced brand protection solutions for retailers through to enhanced artificialintelligence led models to identify cross bank and crossborder fraudulent transactions we continue to see increasing competition for traditional retail banks and consumer lenders from financial technology companies and other online lending new entrants which provides opportunities for us to support many existing and potential clients with our enhanced digital solutions and analytical tools providing new ways for us to communicate and engage with our clients today in our remote environment and in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and intangible assets pension and other postretirement benefits stockbased compensation and income taxes actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions

 

revenue recognition 

 

we recognize revenue based on the transfer of promised goods or services to customers for the amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services revenue is recognized in a fivestep model 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation revenues for hosted subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term revenues from certain discrete project based advisoryconsulting services are recognized over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation based on the input method of consulting hours worked this aligns with the results achieved and value transferred to the customer revenues from transactional solutions are recognized as the solutions are delivered or services performed at point in time

 

we invoice our customers in annual quarterly or monthly installments amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenues on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met

 

stockbased compensation 

 

stockbased compensation cost including stock options restricted stock and performance share units psus is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period the fair value of stock options is measured using a blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the use of several estimates including expected term expected riskfree interest rate expected volatility and expected dividend yield the fair value of the restricted stock is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date the fair value of psus is determined on the grant date using the monte carlo simulation model

 

option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the fouryear vesting period psus are generally expensed ratably over the threeyear vesting period we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1 2005 which requires that stockbased compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service

 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate

 

 

 

goodwill and intangibles 

 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets  this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value

 

as of december 31 2020 we had goodwill of 41081 million which represents 543   of our to tal assets during 2020 we performed an impairment test as of june 30 2020 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary none of our reporting units are at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing including an estimate of future expected revenues ebitda ebitda margins and cash flows useful lives and discount rates and an estimate of value using multiples derived from the stock prices of publicly traded guideline companies applied to such expected cash flows and market approaches in order to estimate fair value we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units to mitigate undue influence we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill there have been no goodwill impairment indicators subsequent to the impairment test performed as of june 30 2020 for the year ended december 31 2020 there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets

 

we allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets the estimates used in valuing the intangible assets are determined with the assistance of thirdparty specialists a discounted cash flow analysis and estimates made by management management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings

 

income taxes 

 

in projecting future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions

 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of asc 740  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this interpretation we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position

 

we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined

 

we estimate unrecognized tax positions o f 58 million that may be recognized by december 31 2021 due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities net of additional uncertain tax positions

 

as of december 31 2020 we have gross federal state and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforw ards of 2211 milli on which will expire at various dates from 2021 through 2040 such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows

 

  

the net deferred income tax lia bility of 3878 million consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2020 we had borrowings outstanding under our cred it facility of 500 m illion which was subsequently repaid the borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 10 to 1625 depending on the public debt rating defined in the credit agreement the current margin is 125 as a result of the current public debt rating a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax income and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instruments based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2020 a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pretax interest exp ense of approximately 05 million bas ed on our current borrowing levels

 

we have started to consider the implications of the transition of libor to alternative reference rate measures that will likely become effective post december 2021 we believe that there is still some uncertainty over what these rates will be but one possibility for us dollar libor would be the secured overnight financing rate sofr as this decision has not been finalized at the time of amending our credit facility agreement there is no definitive alternative rate proposed in the current contract we are however reviewing the potential impact on the application of this rate on our interest expense once it becomes applicable as our only current contract extending beyond 2021 that is subject to the libor rate is the credit facility the impact will be dependent on what the outstanding borrowing amount is on the credit facility and the relevant interest rate that will be contractually applicable should we amend our credit facility to reflect sofr based on recent borrowings and applicable sofr we do not anticipate to have a material impact on the business

 

foreign currency risk 

 

our foreignbased businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates a portion of our revenue is denominated in british pounds and other foreign currencies if the us dollar strengthens against british pounds and other foreign currencies our revenues reported in us dollars would decline with regard to operating expense our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in british pounds and other foreign currencies if british pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen costs reported in us dollars will increase movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 a hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings

our history 

we trace our history to 1971 when insurance services office inc or iso started operations as a notforprofit advisory and rating organization providing services to the us pc insurance industry iso was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators as required by law iso’s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development underwriting and rating functions 

on may 23 2008 in contemplation of our initial public offering or ipo iso formed verisk analytics inc or verisk a delaware corporation to be the holding company for our business verisk was initially formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of iso on october 6 2009 in connection with our ipo the company effected a reorganization whereby iso became a wholly owned subsidiary of verisk verisk common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on october 7 2009 under the ticker symbol “vrsk” 

over the past two decades we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the american insurance services group or aisg and certain operations and assets of the national insurance crime bureau in 1997 and 1998 respectively those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud to further expand our business in 2002 we acquired air worldwide or air the technological leader in catastrophe modeling in 2006 to bolster our position in the insurance claims field we acquired xactware solutions inc a leading supplier of estimation software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction in 2012 we acquired argus information  advisory services llc or argus to expand our global presence providing information competitive benchmarking analytics and customized services to financial institutions in the payments space in 2015 we acquired wood mackenzie limited or wood mackenzie to advance our strategy to expand internationally and position us in the global energy market in 2017 we acquired g2 web services llc or g2 sequel business solutions ltd or sequel lundquist consulting inc or lci and poweradvocate inc or poweradvocate to further strengthen our position in their respective segments g2 provides merchant risk intelligence solutions for acquirers commercial banks and other payment system providers sequel is a leading insurance and reinsurance software specialist based in london lci offers risk insight prediction and management solutions for banks and creditors poweradvocate is a leading data analytics provider with a oneofakind spend and cost data curated from millions of transactions across thousands of services materials and equipment categories in the energy industry in 2018 we acquired rulebook limited or rulebook to further our international insurance presence in the overseas market in 2019 we acquired genscape inc or genscape and flexible architecture and simplified technology llc or fast to enhance our solutions within the energy and specialized markets segment and insurance segment respectively

insurance segment 

our insurance segment primarily serves our pc insurance customers and focuses on the prediction of loss the selection and pricing of risk and compliance with their reporting requirements in each us state in which they operate we also develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better manage their businesses including detecting fraud before and after a loss event and quantifying losses our customers include most of the pc insurance providers in the us in recent years we have expanded our offerings also to serve certain nonus markets 

underwriting  rating 

we are the recognized leader in the us for industrystandard insurance programs that help pc insurers define coverages and issue policies we provide policy language prospective loss costs policy writing rules and a variety of other solutions for 30 lines of insurance our policy language prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language rules and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements they must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law to meet their insurers needs we process approximately 2400 regulatory filings and interface with state regulators in all 50 states plus the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands each year to ensure smooth implementation of our rules and forms when insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs our industrystandard insurance programs also help regulators ensure that such insurers’ policies meet basic coverage requirements 

standardized coverage language which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation helps ensure consistent treatment of claimants as a result our industrystandard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known our policy language includes standard coverage language endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they offer with these policy programs insurers also benefit from economies of scale we have more than 120 specialized lawyers and insurance experts reviewing changes in each state’s insurance rules and regulations including an average of approximately 15000 legislative bills 11000 regulatory actions and 2000 court decisions per year to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information 

to cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace we offer a broad range of policy programs for example in the homeowners line of insurance we maintain policy language and rules for 6 basic coverages 282 national endorsements and 612 statespecific endorsements 

the pc insurance industry is heavily regulated in the us pc insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate our statistical agent services have enabled pc insurers to meet those regulatory requirements for more than 45 years we aggregate the data and as a licensed or appointed “statistical agent” in all 50 states puerto rico and the district of columbia we report those statistics to insurance regulators we are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the us pc insurance industry 

to provide our customers and the regulators the information they require we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world over the past four decades we have developed core expertise in acquiring processing managing and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our insurance offerings we use our proprietary technology to assemble organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers we supplement this data with publicly available information

we project customers future losses and loss expenses using a broad set of data those projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used their own data exclusively we make a number of actuarial adjustments before the data is used to estimate future costs our customers can use our estimates of future costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies for most pc insurers in most lines of business we believe that our estimates of future costs are an essential input to rating decisions our actuarial products and services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industrystandard insurance programs described above 

we gather information on individual properties and communities so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price personal and commercial property insurance as well as commercial liability insurance our propertyspecific rating and underwriting information allows our customers to understand quantify underwrite mitigate and avoid potential loss for commercial properties our database contains loss costs and other relevant information on more than 38 million commercial risks in the us and also holds information on more than 69 million individual businesses within those risks we have a staff of approximately 540 field representatives strategically located around the us who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties evaluate community fireprotection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal buildingcode enforcement each year our field staff visits more than 292000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes

when we find it advantageous we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings this approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows 

sales marketing and customer support 

we sell our solutions and services primarily through direct interaction with our customers we employ a threetier sales structure that includes salespeople technical consultants and sales support within the company several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services those specialized sales teams sell specific highly technical solution sets to targeted markets in coordination with account management 

  

to provide account management to our largest customers in the insurance energy and financial markets we divide our customers into three groups tier one or “globalnational” accounts comprises our largest customers tier two or “strategic” accounts represents both large and middlemarket customer groups tier three is composed of small and specialized companies that may represent one line of business may be regionally focused or are recent new entrants into the marketplace in tier one and tier two segments we have sales teams organized by the following specialties personal or commercial lines underwriting and pricing claims catastrophe risk and energy in the tier three segment we assign a sales generalist with overall account management responsibility our tiered approach has proven to be a successful sales model and approach to building customer relationships our senior executives regularly engage with the senior management of our customers to ensure customer satisfaction and strategic alignment and to support mutual partnership innovation opportunities 

sales people participate in both sales and customer service activities they provide direct support interacting frequently with assigned customers to ensure a satisfactory experience using our services salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activities and ensure our solutions fit the customers needs we believe our salespeople’s product knowledge skills to develop relationships of trust and local presence differentiate us from our competition technical consultants are subject matter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products and segments both salespeople and technical consultants have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities a team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination among the groups 

sources of our data 

the data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions is sourced through seven different kinds of data arrangements first we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created from their data those agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out it is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data second we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide their required levels of privacy protection of data and where necessary deidentification of data the agreements represent no cost to us generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and require renewal third we “mine” data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions as an example we use the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models again those arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way fourth we source data generally at no cost from public sources including federal state and local governments fifth we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff members who also perform property surveys at the request of and facilitated by property insurers sixth we collect data or license or purchase from third parties on geographic and spatially referenced information relating to residential and commercial structures by using the latest remote sensing and machine learning technologies lastly we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased including county tax assessor records descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses we are the owners of the derivative solutions we create using the data we collect 

information technology 

technology 

our information technology systems and the more recent adoption of cloud computing are fundamental to our success they are used for the storage processing access and delivery of the data that forms the foundation of our business and the development and delivery of the solutions we provide to our customers much of the technology we use and provide to our customers is developed maintained and supported by approximately 18 of our employee population we generally own or have secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business all the customerfacing applications that are material to our operations we support and implement a mix of technologies and focus on implementing the most efficient technology for any given business requirement or task

intellectual property 

we own a significant number of intellectual property rights including copyrights trademarks trade secrets and patents specifically our policy language insurance manuals software and databases are protected by both registered and 

common law copyrights and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue we also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the us and foreign countries including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines many of which are registered we believe many of our trademarks trade names service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them we consider our intellectual property to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of statutory for example copyright trademark trade secret and patent and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect it wherever it is used 

we also own several patents and have several pending patent applications in the us that complement our products the patents and patent applications include claims that pertain to technology including a patent for our liability navigator ® ™ product we believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and that are material to our business 

to maintain control of our intellectual property we enter into contractual agreements with our customers granting each customer permission to use our products and services including our software and databases this helps maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions as a general practice employees contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights information and technology 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we employed 9060 fulltime and 240 parttime employees none of our employees located in the us are represented by unions we consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements

regulation 

because our business involves the distribution of certain personal public and nonpublic data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility service and marketing decisions based on such data certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws in the us and to a lesser extent in foreign countries examples of such regulation include the fair credit reporting act which regulates the use of consumer credit report information the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of nonpublic personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions the drivers privacy protection act which prohibits the public disclosure use or resale by any state’s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record except for a “permissible purpose” and various other federal state and local laws and regulations 

those laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used to challenge the accuracy of such information andor to prevent the use and disclosure of such information in certain instances the laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances 

we are also licensed as a rating rate service advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all 50 states puerto rico guam the us virgin islands and the district of columbia as such an advisory organization we provide statistical actuarial policy language development and related products and services to pc insurers including advisory prospective loss costs other prospective cost information manual rules and policy language we also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policy writing and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators 

many of our products services and operations as well as insurers use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the mccarranferguson act as a result many of our operations and products are subject to review andor approval by state regulators further our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and 

trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes which are typically enforced by state attorneys general andor insurance regulators

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to invest in any of our securities if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer in such case the trading price of our securities including our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions 

we depend upon data from external sources including data received from customers and various government and public record services for information used in our databases in general we do not own the information in these databases and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons and we could also become subject to legislative judicial or contractual restrictions on the use of such data in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way that allows us to legally use andor process the data in addition some of our customers have been and in the future may continue to be stockholders of our company if our customers’ percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases or they cease to be stockholders of our company there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms if a substantial number of data sources or certain key sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

agreements with our data suppliers are shortterm agreements some suppliers are also competitors which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors an advantage such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute data sources 

fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other cybersecurity or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation 

security breaches in our facilities computer networks and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers many of our solutions involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data as with other global companies our systems are regularly subject to cyberattacks cyberthreats physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems as cyberthreats continue to evolve we are required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures and to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities and incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate or detect all security breaches nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyberthreats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate prevent or detect all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss although we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyberincidents no cyberattack or other cyberincident has to our knowledge had a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations to date 

thirdparty contractors including cloudbased service providers also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information if users gain improper access to our databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify confidential thirdparty information that is stored or transmitted on our networks our business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access our network products and services our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks 

in addition customers’ employees’ or other’s misuse of andor gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers any such misappropriation andor misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us among other things being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation 

a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways 

 incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed or any other security or privacy breaches may occur and could go undetected the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown any such incident could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows in addition media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our thirdparty suppliers even if no breach has been attempted or occurred could also adversely impact our reputation and materially impact our business 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from us pc primary insurers if there is a downturn in the us insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions our revenues will decline 

revenues derived from solutions we provide to us pc primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2019  approximately 49 of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to us pc primary insurers also invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the us pc insurance market which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry that are beyond our control in addition our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions 

factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by pc primary insurers include the following 

 a downturn in the insurance industry pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

acquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions 

our longterm business strategy includes growth through acquisitions future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful acquisitions or investments any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in the acquisitions of businesses such risks include among other things 



 the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition 

we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities although we have capacity under committed facilities those may not be sufficient therefore future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in dilution 

in addition to the extent we cannot identify or consummate on terms acceptable to us acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth 

there may be consolidation in our end customer market which could reduce the use of our services 

mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon for example in the pc insurance sector any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions our business could suffer serious harm 

our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions if we are unable to develop new solutions or if we are not successful in introducing andor obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate in addition significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in the past we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions primarily due to difficulties in developing models acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments errors or defects in our solutions that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection of our solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenues diversion of development resources an increase in product liability claims and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims 

we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them our business could be harmed 

our success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights to date we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology this protection of our proprietary technology is limited and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent in addition patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage any disclosure loss invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and ultimately our business our protection of our intellectual property rights in the us or abroad may not be adequate and others including our competitors may use our proprietary technology without our consent furthermore litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face claims for intellectual property infringement which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers 

there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings particularly in the us regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry there is a risk that we are infringing or may in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties we have from timetotime been subject to litigation alleging intellectual property infringement we monitor thirdparty patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate however such monitoring and analysis has not been and is unlikely in the future to be comprehensive and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications since the patent application process can take several years to complete there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies as a result we may infringe existing and future thirdparty patents of which we are not aware as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 

thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions even if we prevail litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management’s time and attention 

if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop noninfringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

because personal public and nonpublic information is stored in some of our databases we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act grammleachbliley act driver’s privacy protection act the european union’s general data protection regulation the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent various other federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace however many consumer advocates privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information particularly social security numbers department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth as a result they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data the company has implemented various measures to comply with the data privacy and protection principles of the european union’s general data protection regulation however there can be no assurances that such methods will be deemed fully compliant if the company is unable to comply with the data privacy and protection principles adopted pursuant to the general data protection regulation it will impede our ability to conduct business between the us and the eu which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that require significant resource commitments which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may lose key business assets through the loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links the internet or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 

our operations depend on our ability as well as that of thirdparty service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions to protect data centers whether in cloud or dedicated environments and related technology against damage from hardware failure fire flood power loss telecommunications failure impacts of terrorism breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers natural disasters or other disasters certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding earthquakes or other disasters the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers in addition we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time any damage to our or our thirdparty service provider’s data centers failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements resulting in decreased revenue operating income and earnings per share 

we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively 

some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive and are expected to remain highly competitive we compete on the basis of quality customer service product and service selection and pricing our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment due to their size certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can as a result these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences emerging technologies and market trends in addition new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away and as we enter into new lines of business due to acquisition or otherwise we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments especially against larger competitors we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete if we fail to successfully compete our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases the demand for some of our solutions may decrease 

public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce the demand for our solutions to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our financial position may be impacted by audit examinations or changes in tax laws or tax rulings 

our existing corporate structure and tax positions have been implemented in a manner in which we believe is compliant with current prevailing tax laws however changes in existing tax laws or rulings including federal state and international could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate cash tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities audit examinations with an adverse outcome could have a negative effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate furthermore the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd released its base erosion and profit shifting beps action plans which may also lead to future tax reform that could affect our results in addition our tax positions are impacted by fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries in which we do business 

our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 

our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace 

however as a general practice we do not enter into employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team except for certain limited situations if we lose key members of our senior management operating team we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers 

our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees if our attrition rate increases our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work 

if our business continues to grow the number of people we will need to hire will increase we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs 

we are subject to antitrust consumer protection and other litigation and may in the future become further subject to such litigation an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

we participate in businesses particularly insurancerelated businesses and services that are subject to substantial litigation including antitrust and consumer protection litigation in addition our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability given the nature of our business we may be subject to litigation in the future even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth 

general economic political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business 

the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a significant additional decline in the 

value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions 

we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with future acquisitions   

in order to finance acquisitions which are an important part of our long term growth strategy we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and such increased leverage could adversely affect our business in particular the increased leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue other operational and strategic opportunities the increased leverage potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

general economic uncertainties including downward trends in the energy industry could reduce demand by wood mackenzie’s customers for its products and services 

demand for wood mackenzie’s products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties particularly any downward trends in the energy industry many factors could negatively affect the revenues profits and discretionary spending of wood mackenzie’s customers such factors include commodity prices in particular oil and coal the state of the local economy interest rates currency exchange rates political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations the availability of industry resources and other matters a downturn or perceived downturn in the economy particularly the energy industry could add pricing pressure delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by wood mackenzie’s customers which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations 

wood mackenzie is based in the united kingdom or uk and conducts its principal operations outside the us as a result the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the us has increased materially conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws legal standards regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers unexpected changes in regulatory requirements taxes trade laws tariffs export quotas custom duties or other trade restrictions differing technology standards difficulties in collecting accounts receivable difficulties in managing and staffing international operations varying expectations as to employee standards potentially adverse tax consequences including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries moreover international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war and other economic or political uncertainties all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations 

the revenues and costs of wood mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling as a result of our acquisition of wood mackenzie and other recent acquisitions outside of the us we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies as exchange rates vary revenue cost of revenue operating expenses and other operating results when remeasured in us dollars may differ materially from expectations although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own such as ongoing management time and expertise external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications 

economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the uk’s exit from the eu could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the results of the referendum on june 23 2016 in the uk to exit the eu which is commonly referred to as “brexit” and to potentially significantly change the uk’s relationship with the eu and the laws and regulations impacting business conducted between the uk and eu countries could disrupt the overall stability of the eu given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual eu countries and negatively impact our european operations an immediate consequence of the brexit vote was an adverse impact to global markets including currency markets which experienced a sharp drop in the value of the british pound longer term the ongoing uncertainty regarding the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu could result in the uk losing access to certain aspects of the single eu market and the global trade deals negotiated by the eu on behalf of its members while the uk formally exited the eu on january 31 

2020 uncertainty remains as to the process and future relationship between the uk and the eu the brexit process and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the uk may adversely affect business activity political stability and economic conditions in the uk the eu and elsewhere the impact of which could have an adverse effect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if there are substantial sales of our common stock our stock price could decline 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive as of december 31 2019  our ten largest shareholders owned 416 of our common stock including 47 of our common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration and subject to limitations on the timing amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly in addition the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

pursuant to our equity incentive plans options to purchase approximately 7064380 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 14 2020  we filed a registration statement under the securities act which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans including for such outstanding options as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

also in the future we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 

our capital structure level of indebtedness and the terms of antitakeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us as a public company we are subject to section 203 which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 150 or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions but we do not intend to do so 

these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future

executive summary 

key performance metrics 

we believe our business’s ability to grow recurring revenue and generate positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy we use yearoveryear revenue and ebitda growth as metrics to measure our performance ebitda and ebitda margin are nongaap financial measures see note 2 within item 6 selected financial data section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the respective gaap financial measures are net income and net income margin 

revenue growth we use yearoveryear revenue growth as a key performance metric we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers sales to new customers sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses 

ebitda growth  we use ebitda growth as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth ebitda growth allows for greater transparency regarding our operating performance and facilitate periodtoperiod comparison 

ebitda margin we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth 

revenues 

we earn revenues through agreements for hosted subscriptions advisoryconsulting services and for transactional solutions recurring and nonrecurring subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year as a result the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period in general we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business 

approximately 82 of the revenues in our insurance segment for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 were derived from hosted subscriptions through agreements generally one to five years for our solutions our customers in this segment include most of the pc insurance providers in the us approximately 78 of the revenues in our energy and specialized markets segment for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 were derived from hosted subscriptions with longterm agreements for our solutions our customers in this segment include most of the top 10 global energy providers around the world approximately 72 and 73 of the revenues in our financial services segment for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively were derived from subscriptions with longterm agreements for our solutions respectively our customers in this segment include financial institutions payment networks and processors alternative lenders regulators merchants and all of the top 30 credit card issuers in north america the united kingdom and australia 

we also provide advisoryconsulting services which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions in addition certain of our solutions are paid for by our customers on a transactional basis recurring and nonrecurring for example we have solutions that allow our customers to access propertyspecific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building or compare a pc insurance or a workers compensation claim with information in our databases or use our repair cost estimation solutions on a casebycase basis for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  approximately 19 and 20 of our consolidated revenues were derived from providing transactional and advisoryconsulting solutions respectively 

principal operating costs and expenses 

personnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses which represented approximately 52 and 58 of our total operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively include salaries benefits incentive compensation equity compensation costs sales commissions employment taxes recruiting costs and outsourced temporary agency costs 

we assign personnel expenses between two categories cost of revenues and selling general and administrative costs based on the actual costs associated with each employee we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues and all other personnel including executive managers sales people marketing business development finance legal human resources and administrative services as selling general and administrative expenses a significant portion of our other operating costs such as facilities and communications are either captured within cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed 

while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues historically our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses however part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions and new businesses which may offset margin expansion 

cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our nextgeneration solutions our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization 

selling general and administrative expense our selling general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities insurance and communications are allocated to selling general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee our selling general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization 

trends affecting our business 

we serve customers in three primary vertical markets pc insurance energy and specialized markets and financial services the industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business 

a significant change in pc insurers’ profitability could affect the demand for our solutions for insurers the keys to profitability include increasing investment income premium growth and disciplined underwriting of risks investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates growth in pc insurers’ direct written premiums is cyclical with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 148 in 2002 to a trough of negative 31 in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 44 in 2012 43 in 2013 44 in 2014 37 in 2015 37 in 2016 47 in 2017 and 55 in 2018 in recent years we have signed multiyear contracts with certain customers and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multiyear period pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years premiums based on the most recent results available direct premium growth and net premium growth accelerated in 2018 however insurers were also challenged by heightened catastrophic losses in 2018 associated with major hurricanes such as florence and michael and several devastating wildfires in the state of california coupled with additional losses reported from the three major hurricanes in 2017  harvey irma and maria these events illustrate the need for broader coverages such as flood to meet the changing needs of communities we continue to provide the necessary resources to meet insurer needs 

trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers’ profitability and therefore on their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of weather events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling catastrophe loss information and repair cost solutions likewise any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from the recent influx of alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products we also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity the need by our customers to fight insurance fraud  both in claims and at policy inception  could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions 

trends in the energy chemicals metals and mining sectors and activity in financial markets can influence our revenues these include geopolitical risks such as the uschina trade dispute and heightened tension in the middle east among others which influenced commodity flows and prices in 2019 commodity markets in energy were also oversupplied challenging the revenues for some of our major energy customers brent oil averaged 64 dollar per barrel in 2019 down from 

71 dollar per barrel in 2018 us and globally traded gas prices are also in a downcycle investment in the natural resources sector fell sharply middecade but has stabilised at a lower level in recent years many companies in the natural resources sector continue to demonstrate tight capital discipline which may affect our business the energy transition presents both a threat and an opportunity for the sector and our revenues increasing global economic growth will lead to higher energy demand and in turn potentially our services fossil fuels will meet much of global demand for some decades but zero carbon energy renewables and emerging technologies such as electric vehicles and energy storage will grow in importance the infrastructure needed for the electrification of economies will drive demand for base metals some bulk commodities and battery raw materials climate change and decarbonisation are rising up the agenda and policy on environmental and social governance is intensifying attracting the capital needed to meet future energy demand is one of the industry’s challenges and data analysis and insight will help our customers achieve this 

trends in the banking and retail sectors can influence revenues in our financial services segment in many ways fraud and similar financial crimes in particular impact our customers in ways ranging from regulatory risk and credit loss for financial institutions to counterfeit loss and inventory shrinkage for merchants this can strengthen demand for our credit risk and fraud solutions ranging from enhanced brand protection solutions for retailers through to enhanced artificialintelligence led models to identify cross bank and crossborder fraudulent transactions following regulatory intervention some markets are seeing increased standardization of offered products across issuers which could stifle competition and innovation for consumers additionally traditional retail banks and consumer lenders face increasing competition from financial technology companies and online lending new entrants and finally the market is reacting to increased data privacy laws such as general data protection regulation or gdpr by demanding broader use of tokenizationbased solutions and managing data use rights more closely our data model has relied on tokenization and we address these emerging issues by leveraging our extensive walletbased market and product data and expertise and also support an active and ongoing dialogue with regulators worldwide to fully understand the impact and adverse consequences of any intended legislation

obligated to purchase the services in most businesses growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows unlike these businesses our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2019 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 



 



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and intangible assets pension and other post retirement benefits stock based compensation and income taxes actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based on the transfer of promised goods or services to customers for the amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services revenue is recognized in a fivestep model 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation revenues for hosted subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term revenues from certain discrete project based advisoryconsulting services are recognized over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation based on the input method of consulting hours worked this aligns with the results achieved and value transferred to the customer revenues from transactional solutions are recognized as the solutions are delivered or services performed at point in time 

we invoice our customers in annual quarterly or monthly installments amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenues on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation cost including stock options restricted stock and performance share units or psus is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period the fair value of stock options is measured using a blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the use of several estimates including expected term expected riskfree interest rate expected volatility and expected dividend yield the fair value of the restricted stock is determined using the closing price of the companys common stock on the grant date the fair value of psus is determined on the grant date using the monte carlo simulation model 

option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the fouryear vesting period psus are generally expensed ratably over the threeyear vesting period we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1 2005 which requires that stockbased compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 

goodwill and intangibles 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets  this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value 

as of december 31 2019  we had goodwill of 38643 million  which represents 548 of our total assets during 2019  we performed an impairment test as of june 30 2019 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary none of our reporting units are at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing including an estimate of future expected revenues ebitda ebitda margins and cash flows useful lives and discount rates and an estimate of value using multiples derived from the stock prices of publicly traded guideline companies applied to such expected cash flows and market approaches in order to estimate fair value we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units to mitigate undue influence we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill there have been no goodwill impairment indicators subsequent to the impairment test performed as of june 30 2019  for the year ended december 31 2019  there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets 

we allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets the estimates used in valuing the intangible assets are determined with the assistance of third party specialists a discounted cash flow analysis and estimates made by management management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

income taxes 

in projecting future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of asc 740  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this interpretation we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 

we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

we estimate unrecognized tax positions of 11 million that may be recognized by december 31 2020 due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities net of additional uncertain tax positions 

as of december 31 2019  we have gross federal state and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of 2291 million  which will expire at various dates from 2020 through 2039 such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows 



the net deferred income tax liability of 3462 million consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2019  we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of 4950 million  which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 10 to 1625 depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax income and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instruments based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2019  a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 50 million based on our current borrowing levels 

we have started to consider the implications of the transition of libor to alternative reference rate measures that will likely become effective post december 2021 we believe that there is still some uncertainty over what these rates will be but one possibility for us dollar libor would be the secured overnight financing rate sofr as this decision has not been finalized at the time of amending our credit facility agreement there is no definitive alternative rate proposed in the current contract we are however reviewing the potential impact on the application of this rate on our interest expense once it becomes applicable as our only current contract extending beyond 2021 that is subject to the libor rate is the credit facility the impact will be dependent on what the outstanding borrowing amount is on the credit facility and the relevant interest rate that will be contractually applicable should we amend our credit facility to reflect sofr based on recent borrowings and applicable sofr we do not anticipate to have a material impact on the business 

foreign currency risk 

our foreignbased businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates a portion of our revenue is denominated in british pounds and other foreign currencies if the us dollar strengthens against british pounds and other foreign currencies our revenues reported in us dollars would decline with regard to operating expense our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in british pounds and other foreign currencies if british pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen costs reported in us dollars will increase movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended december 31 2019  a hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings

our history 

we trace our history to 1971 when insurance services office inc or iso started operations as a notforprofit advisory and rating organization providing services to the us pc insurance industry iso was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators as required by law iso’s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development underwriting and rating functions 

on may 23 2008 in contemplation of our initial public offering or ipo iso formed verisk analytics inc or verisk a delaware corporation to be the holding company for our business verisk was initially formed as a whollyowned subsidiary 

of iso on october 6 2009 in connection with our ipo the company effected a reorganization whereby iso became a whollyowned subsidiary of verisk verisk common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on october 7 2009 under the ticker symbol “vrsk” 

over the past two decades we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the american insurance services group or aisg and certain operations and assets of the national insurance crime bureau in 1997 and 1998 respectively those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud to further expand our business in 2002 we acquired air worldwide or air the technological leader in catastrophe modeling in 2006 to bolster our position in the insurance claims field we acquired xactware a leading supplier of estimation software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction in 2012 we acquired argus information  advisory services llc or argus to expand our global presence providing information competitive benchmarking analytics and customized services to financial institutions in the payments space in 2015 we acquired wood mackenzie limited or wood mackenzie to advance our strategy to expand internationally and position us in the global energy market in 2017 we acquired a group of similar but unrelated companies for aerial image capture purposes or aerial imagery acquisitions in our insurance vertical additionally in 2017 we acquired g2 web services llc or g2 sequel business solutions ltd or sequel lundquist consulting inc or lci and poweradvocate inc or poweradvocate to further strengthen our position in the insurance energy and specialized markets and financial services segments the aerial imagery acquisitions provide multispectral aerial photographic services with expertise in offering digital photogrammetric and remote sensing data for mapping and surveying applications g2 provides merchant risk intelligence solutions for acquirers commercial banks and other payment system providers sequel is a leading insurance and reinsurance software specialist based in london lci offers risk insight prediction and management solutions for banks and creditors poweradvocate is a leading data analytics provider with a oneofakind spend and cost data that are curated from millions of transactions across thousands of services materials and equipment categories in the energy industry in 2018 we acquired rulebook limited or rulebook to further our international insurance presence in the overseas market

standardized coverage language which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation helps ensure consistent treatment of claimants as a result our industrystandard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known our policy language includes standard coverage language endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they offer with these policy programs insurers also benefit from economies of scale we have more than 120 specialized lawyers and insurance experts reviewing changes in each state’s insurance rules and regulations including an average of approximately 13000 legislative bills 9000 regulatory actions and 2000 court decisions per year to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information 

to cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace we offer a broad range of policy programs for example in the homeowners line of insurance we maintain policy language and rules for 6 basic coverages 283 national endorsements and 611 statespecific endorsements 

the pc insurance industry is heavily regulated in the us pc insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate our statistical agent services have enabled pc insurers to meet those regulatory requirements for more than 45 years we aggregate the data and as a licensed or appointed “statistical agent” in all 50 states puerto rico and the district of columbia we report those statistics to insurance regulators we are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the us pc insurance industry 

to provide our customers and the regulators the information they require we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world over the past four decades we have developed core expertise in acquiring processing managing and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our insurance offerings we use our proprietary technology to assemble organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers we supplement this data with publicly available information 

each year pc insurers send us approximately 37 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred we maintain a database of more than 214 billion statistical records including approximately 91 billion commercial lines records and approximately 123 billion personal lines records we collect unit transaction detail of each premium and loss record which enhances the validity reliability and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial analyses our proprietary quality process includes more than 2900 separate checks to ensure that the data meets our high standards of quality

we project customers future losses and loss expenses using a broad set of data those projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used their own data exclusively we make a number of actuarial adjustments before the data is used to estimate future costs our customers can use our estimates of future costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies for most pc insurers in most lines of business we believe that our estimates of future costs are an essential input to rating decisions our actuarial products and services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industrystandard insurance programs described above 

we gather information on properties businesses and communities so that insurers can evaluate price and efficiently process commercial insurance applications including property auto general liability business owners policy and workers compensation our propertyspecific rating and underwriting data and analytics allow our customers to understand quantify mitigate and avoid potential losses while matching price to exposure our prometrix ® platform contains information on 6 million commercial buildings 275 million businesses loss costs and virtually all communities in the us we have a staff of approximately 550 field representatives strategically located around the us who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties evaluate community fireprotection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal buildingcode enforcement each year our field staff visits approximately 290000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes

identifying new sales opportunities a team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination among the groups 

sources of our data 

the data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions is sourced through seven different kinds of data arrangements first we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created from their data those agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out it is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data second we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide their required levels of privacy protection of data and where necessary deidentification of data the agreements represent no cost to us generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and require renewal third we “mine” data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions as an example we use the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models again those arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way fourth we source data generally at no cost from public sources including federal state and local governments fifth we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff members who also perform property surveys at the request of and facilitated by property insurers sixth we independently collect data on geographic and spatially referenced information relating to residential and commercial structures by using the latest remote sensing and machine learning technologies lastly we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased including county tax assessor records descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses we are the owners of the derivative solutions we create using the data we collect 

information technology

services and our logos and tag lines many of which are registered we believe many of our trademarks trade names service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them we consider our intellectual property to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of statutory for example copyright trademark trade secret and patent and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect it wherever it is used 

we also own several patents and have several pending patent applications in the us that complement our products the patents and patent applications include claims that pertain to technology including a patent for our liability navigator™ product we believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and that are material to our business

regulation 

because our business involves the distribution of certain personal public and nonpublic data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility service and marketing decisions based on such data certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws in the us and to a lesser extent in foreign countries examples of such regulation include the fair credit reporting act which regulates the use of consumer credit report information the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of non public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions the drivers privacy protection act which prohibits the public disclosure use or resale by any state’s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record except for a “permissible purpose” and various other federal state and local laws and regulations 

those laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used to challenge the accuracy of such information andor to prevent the use and disclosure of such information in certain instances the laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances

many of our products services and operations as well as insurers use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the mccarranferguson act as a result many of our operations and products are subject to review andor approval by state regulators furthermore our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes which are typically enforced by state attorneys general andor insurance regulators

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to invest in any of our securities if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer in such case the trading price of our securities including our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions 

we depend upon data from external sources including data received from customers and various government and public record services for information used in our databases in general we do not own the information in these databases and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons and we could also become subject to legislative judicial or contractual restrictions on the use of such data in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way that allows us to legally use andor process the data in addition some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company specifically a portion of common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers if our customers’ percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms if a substantial number of data sources or certain key sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

agreements with our data suppliers are shortterm agreements some suppliers are also competitors which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors an advantage such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute data sources 

fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other cybersecurity or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation 

security breaches in our facilities computer networks and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers many of our solutions involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data as with other global companies our systems are regularly subject to cyberattacks cyberthreats physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems as cyberthreats continue to evolve we are required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures and to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities and incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate or detect all security breaches nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyberthreats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate prevent or detect all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss although we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyberincidents no cyberattack or other cyberincident has to our knowledge had a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations to date 

thirdparty contractors including cloudbased service providers also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information if users gain improper access to our databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify confidential thirdparty information that is stored or transmitted on our networks our business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access our network products and services our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks 

in addition customers’ employees’ or other’s misuse of andor gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers any such misappropriation andor misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us among other things being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation 

a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways 

 incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed or any other security or privacy breaches may occur and could go undetected the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown any such incident could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows in addition media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our thirdparty suppliers even if no breach has been attempted or occurred could also adversely impact our reputation and materially impact our business 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from us pc primary insurers if there is a downturn in the us insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions our revenues will decline 

revenues derived from solutions we provide to us pc primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 47 of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to us pc primary insurers also invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the us pc insurance market which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry that are beyond our control in addition our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions 

factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by pc primary insurers include the following 

 a downturn in the insurance industry pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

acquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions 

our longterm business strategy includes growth through acquisitions future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful investments any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in the acquisitions of businesses such risks include among other things 



 the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition 

we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities although we have capacity under committed facilities those may not be sufficient therefore future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in dilution 

in addition to the extent we cannot identify or consummate on terms acceptable to us acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth 

there may be consolidation in our end customer market which could reduce the use of our services 

mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon for example in the pc insurance sector any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions our business could suffer serious harm 

our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions if we are unable to develop new solutions or if we are not successful in introducing andor obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate in addition significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in the past we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions primarily due to difficulties in developing models acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments errors or defects in our solutions that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection of our solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenues diversion of development resources an increase in product liability claims and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims 

we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them our business could be harmed 

our success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights to date we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology this protection of our proprietary technology is limited and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent in addition patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage any disclosure loss invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and ultimately our business our protection of our intellectual property rights in the us or abroad may not be adequate and others including our competitors may use our proprietary technology without our consent furthermore litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face claims for intellectual property infringement which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers 

there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings particularly in the us regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry there is a risk that we are infringing or may in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties we have from timetotime been subject to litigation alleging intellectual property infringement we monitor thirdparty patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate however such monitoring and analysis has not been and is unlikely in the future to be comprehensive and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications since the patent application process can take several years to complete there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies as a result we may infringe existing and future thirdparty patents of which we are not aware as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 

thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions even if we prevail litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management’s time and attention 

if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop noninfringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

because personal public and nonpublic information is stored in some of our databases we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act grammleachbliley act driver’s privacy protection act the european union’s general data protection regulation the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent various other federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace however many consumer advocates privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information particularly social security numbers department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth as a result they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data the company has implemented various measures to comply with the data privacy and protection principles of the european union’s general data protection regulation however there can be no assurances that such methods will be deemed fully compliant if the company is unable to comply with the data privacy and protection principles adopted pursuant to the general data protection regulation it will impede our ability to conduct business between the us and the eu which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that require significant resource commitments which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may lose key business assets through the loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links the internet or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 

our operations depend on our ability as well as that of thirdparty service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions to protect data centers whether in cloud or dedicated environments and related technology against damage from hardware failure fire flood power loss telecommunications failure impacts of terrorism breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers natural disasters or other disasters certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding earthquakes or other disasters the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers in addition we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time any damage to our or our thirdparty service provider’s data centers failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements resulting in decreased revenue operating income and earnings per share 

we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively 

some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive and are expected to remain highly competitive we compete on the basis of quality customer service product and service selection and pricing our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment due to their size certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can as a result these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences emerging technologies and market trends in addition new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away and as we enter into new lines of business due to acquisition or otherwise we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments especially against larger competitors we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete if we fail to successfully compete our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases the demand for some of our solutions may decrease 

public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce the demand for our solutions to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our financial position may be impacted by audit examinations or changes in tax laws or tax rulings 

our existing corporate structure and tax positions have been implemented in a manner in which we believe is compliant with current prevailing tax laws however changes in existing tax laws or rulings including federal state and international could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate cash tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities audit examinations with an adverse outcome could have a negative effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate furthermore the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd released its base erosion and profit shifting beps action plans which may also lead to future tax reform that could affect our results in addition our tax positions are impacted by fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries in which we do business 

our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 

our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace 

however as a general practice we do not enter into employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team except for certain limited situations if we lose key members of our senior management operating team we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers 

our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees if our attrition rate increases our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work 

if our business continues to grow the number of people we will need to hire will increase we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs 

we are subject to antitrust consumer protection and other litigation and may in the future become further subject to such litigation an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

we participate in businesses particularly insurancerelated businesses and services that are subject to substantial litigation including antitrust and consumer protection litigation in addition our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability given the nature of our business we may be subject to litigation in the future even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth 

general economic political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business 

the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a significant additional decline in the 

value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions 

we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with future acquisitions   

in order to finance acquisitions which are an important part of our long term growth strategy we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and such increased leverage could adversely affect our business in particular the increased leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue other operational and strategic opportunities the increased leverage potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

general economic uncertainties including downward trends in the energy industry could reduce demand by wood mackenzie’s customers for its products and services 

demand for wood mackenzie’s products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties particularly any downward trends in the energy industry many factors could negatively affect the revenues profits and discretionary spending of wood mackenzie’s customers such factors include commodity prices in particular oil and coal the state of the local economy interest rates currency exchange rates political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations the availability of industry resources and other matters a downturn or perceived downturn in the economy particularly the energy industry could add pricing pressure delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by wood mackenzie’s customers which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations 

wood mackenzie is based in the united kingdom or uk and conducts its principal operations outside the us as a result the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the us has increased materially conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws legal standards regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers unexpected changes in regulatory requirements taxes trade laws tariffs export quotas custom duties or other trade restrictions differing technology standards difficulties in collecting accounts receivable difficulties in managing and staffing international operations varying expectations as to employee standards potentially adverse tax consequences including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries moreover international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war and other economic or political uncertainties all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations 

the revenues and costs of wood mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling as a result of our acquisition of wood mackenzie and other recent acquisitions outside of the us we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies as exchange rates vary revenue cost of revenue operating expenses and other operating results when remeasured in us dollars may differ materially from expectations although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own such as ongoing management time and expertise external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications 

economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the uk’s exit from the eu could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the results of the referendum on june 23 2016 in the uk to exit the eu which is commonly referred to as “brexit” and to potentially significantly change the uk’s relationship with the eu and the laws and regulations impacting business conducted between the uk and eu countries could disrupt the overall stability of the eu given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual eu countries and negatively impact our european operations an immediate consequence of the brexit vote was an adverse impact to global markets including currency markets which experienced a sharp drop in the value of the british pound longer term the ongoing negotiations regarding the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu could result in the uk losing access to certain aspects of the single eu market and the global trade deals negotiated by the eu on behalf of its members while the uk is currently expected to leave the eu on 

march 29 2019 uncertainty remains as to the exact timing and process the brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the uk may adversely affect business activity political stability and economic conditions in the uk the eu and elsewhere the impact of which could have an adverse effect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if there are substantial sales of our common stock our stock price could decline 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive as of december 31 2018  our ten largest shareholders owned 412 of our common stock including 39 of our common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration and subject to limitations on the timing amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly in addition the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

pursuant to our equity incentive plans options to purchase approximately 6730288 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 15 2019 we filed a registration statement under the securities act which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans including for such outstanding options as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

also in the future we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 

our capital structure level of indebtedness and the terms of antitakeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us as a public company we are subject to section 203 which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 150 or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions but we do not intend to do so 

these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k as well as the discussion under “selected consolidated financial data” this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including but not limited to those listed under “risk factors” and “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

verisk is a leading data analytics provider serving customers in insurance energy and specialized markets and financial services using advanced technologies to collect and analyze billions of records we draw on unique data assets and deep domain expertise to provide innovations that may be integrated into customer workflows we offer predictive analytics and decision support solutions to customers in rating underwriting claims catastrophe and weather risk natural resources intelligence economic forecasting and many other fields in the united states or us and around the world we help customers protect people property and financial assets refer to item 1 business for further discussion 

our customers use our solutions to make better decisions about risk and opportunities with greater efficiency and discipline we refer to these products and services as “solutions” due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products these solutions take various forms including data statistical models or tailored analytics all designed to allow our customers to make more logical decisions we believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers’ revenues and help them better manage their costs 

we previously reported results based on two operating segments decision analytics and risk assessment during the first quarter of 2018 the chief operating decision maker or codm changed how he makes operating decisions assesses the performance of the business and allocates resources in a manner that caused the companys operating segments to change consequently effective as of the first quarter of 2018 our operating segments are based on three vertical markets we serve insurance energy and specialized markets and financial services these three operating segments are also our reportable segments which have been retroactively recast to reflect the new segments in all periods presented 

our insurance segment provides underwriting and ratings and claims insurance data for the us pc insurance industry this segments revenues represented approximately 71 and 72 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively our energy and specialized markets segment provides research and consulting data analytics for the global energy chemicals and metals and mining industries our energy and specialized markets segments revenues represented approximately 22 and 21 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively our financial services segment provides competitive benchmarking decisioning algorithms business intelligence and customized analytic services to financial institutions payment networks and processors alternative lenders regulators and merchants our financial services segments revenues represented approximately 7 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  

executive summary 

key performance metrics 

we believe our business’s ability to grow recurring revenue and generate positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy we use yearoveryear revenue and ebitda growth as metrics to measure our performance ebitda and ebitda margin are nongaap financial measures see note 2 within item 6 selected financial data section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the respective gaap financial measures are net income and net income margin 

revenue growth  we use yearoveryear revenue growth as a key performance metric we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers sales to new customers sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses 

ebitda growth  we use ebitda growth as a proxy for the cash generated by the business ebitda growth serves as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth 

ebitda margin  we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth 

revenues 

we earn revenues through agreements for hosted subscriptions advisoryconsulting services and for transactional solutions recurring and nonrecurring subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year as a result the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period in general we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business 

approximately 82 and 81 of the revenues in our insurance segment for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  were derived from hosted subscriptions through agreements generally one  to five  years for our solutions our customers in this segment include most of the pc insurance providers in the us approximately 78 and 82 of the revenues in our energy and specialized markets segment for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively were derived from hosted subscriptions with longterm agreements for our solutions our customers in this segment include most of the top 10 global energy providers around the world approximately 73 and 72 of the revenues in our financial services segment for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively were derived from subscriptions with longterm agreements for our solutions respectively our customers in this segment include financial institutions payment networks and processors alternative lenders regulators merchants and all of the top 30  credit card issuers in north america the united kingdom and australia 

we also provide advisoryconsulting services which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions in addition certain of our solutions are paid for by our customers on a transactional basis recurring and nonrecurring for example we have solutions that allow our customers to access propertyspecific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building or compare a pc insurance or a workers compensation claim with information in our databases or use our repair cost estimation solutions on a casebycase basis for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  approximately 20 and 19 respectively of our revenues were derived from providing transactional and advisoryconsulting solutions 

principal operating costs and expenses 

personnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses which represented approximately 58 and 59 of our total operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively include salaries benefits incentive compensation equity compensation costs sales commissions employment taxes recruiting costs and outsourced temporary agency costs 

we assign personnel expenses between two categories cost of revenues and selling general and administrative costs based on the actual costs associated with each employee we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues and all other personnel including executive managers sales people marketing business development finance legal human resources and administrative services as selling general and administrative expenses a significant portion of our other 

operating costs such as facilities and communications are either captured within cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed 

while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues historically our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses however part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions and new businesses which may offset margin expansion 

cost of revenues  our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our nextgeneration solutions our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization 

selling general and administrative expense  our selling general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities insurance and communications are allocated to selling general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee our selling general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization 

trends affecting our business 

we serve customers in three primary vertical markets pc insurance energy and specialized markets and financial services the industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business 

 a significant change in pc insurers’ profitability could affect the demand for our solutions for insurers the keys to profitability include increasing investment income premium growth and disciplined underwriting of risks investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates growth in pc insurers’ direct written premiums is cyclical with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 148 in 2002 to a trough of negative 31 in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 44 in 2012 43 in 2013 44 in 2014 37 in 2015 37 in 2016 and 47 in 2017 in recent years we have signed multiyear contracts with certain customers and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multiyear period pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years premiums 

based on the most recent results available direct premium growth and net premium growth accelerated in 2018   however insurers were also challenged by heightened catastrophic losses in 2018 associated with major hurricanes such as florence and michael and several devastating wildfires in the state of california coupled with additional losses reported from the three major hurricanes in 2017  harvey irma and maria these events illustrate the need for broader coverages such as flood to meet the changing needs of communities we continue to provide the necessary resources to meet insurer needs 

trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers’ profitability and therefore on their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of weather events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling catastrophe loss information and repair cost solutions likewise any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from the recent influx of alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products we also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity the need by our customers to fight insurance fraud  both in claims and at policy inception  could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions 

trends in the energy chemicals and metals and mining sectors and activity in financial markets can influence our revenues during 2018 the brent oil price reached a peak of over approximately 80 dollar per barrel before falling under approximately 60 dollar per barrel by year end reflecting an oversupply in the market the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec announced a significant cut in production beginning january 1 2019 to help balance the market in the upstream sector there are five global trends first capital investments have recovered from the cyclical low the start of spend on a new global phase of significant liquefied natural gas projects adding momentum in 2019 second the industry’s ongoing progress in reducing costs have been boosted by digitalization initiatives as well as overcapacity in the service sector in many regions leading to improved economics and more projects reaching a final investment decision third tight oil production in the us lower 48 is still on a strong growth trajectory and remains a focus of global merger and acquisition activity as the industry consolidates fourth resource capture continues to be focused on lower risk opportunities with competitive bidding in 2019 to develop discovered fields in qatar gas and brazil oil fifth many countries are reviewing their existing fiscal policies to ensure that they are competitive and attract investment in the wider energy sector the energy transition is gaining momentum most evidently in the rapid penetration of renewables into power and the emergence of electric vehicles – the latter set to present a competitive challenge to the internal combustion engine in the coming decades and 

with implications for oil demand in the long term petrochemicals is a key growth segment for oil demand but the disposal of plastics is increasingly in the public eye as a social and environmental concern new legislation limiting sulphur content in marine fuels comes into effect in 2020 with profound implications for refiners and major fuel consumers such as airlines as environmental concerns and the move to decarbonization gather pace we will continue to evolve our offerings to meet the needs of our customers in a dynamic market and remain increasingly well positioned to serve our customers information and analytical needs 

market trends continue to influence our financial services segment in important ways as we look forward towards 2019 increasing fraud and delinquency loss rates worldwide are strengthening demand for robust risk solutions which we are addressing via a range of new fraud solutions which we have initially launched in mexico additionally higher levels of regulatory scrutiny as well as greater regulatory alignment worldwide is increasing demand for compliance and reporting tools which we are tackling via our range of compliance products developed both within our financial services segment in order to better serve our customers add to our data asset and expand our expertise we made a number of acquisitions in the past year including marketview which provides analytical solutions for banks acquirers merchants and government in new zealand these new businesses offer new solutions for existing and new clients of our core business and enable us to develop product and cost synergies going forward and join our existing businesses that we acquired earlier and have integrated during 2018

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2018  in management’s opinion the quarterly data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and reflects all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of this data the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period 



liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents and availableforsale securities of 1428 million  and 1461 million respectively subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year we have historically generated significant cash flows from operations as a result of this factor as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and to fuel our future growth plans 

we have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that as described above we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or longterm contracts which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered when cash is received for prepayment of invoices we record an asset cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability deferred revenues this current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services in most businesses growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows unlike these businesses our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services 

our consolidated capital expenditures as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  were 96  and 86 respectively expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internaluse software and are capitalized in accordance with asc 35040 “ accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use ” we also capitalize amounts in accordance with asc 98520 “ software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed ”

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2018  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 





offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and intangible assets pension and other post retirement benefits stock based compensation and income taxes actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based on the transfer of promised goods or services to customers for the amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services revenue is recognized in a fivestep model 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation revenues for hosted subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term revenues from certain discrete project based advisoryconsulting services are recognized over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation based on the input method of consulting hours worked this aligns with the results achieved and value transferred to the customer revenues from transactional solutions are recognized as the solutions are delivered or services performed at point in time 

we invoice our customers in annual quarterly or monthly installments amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenues on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation cost including stock options restricted stock and performance share units or psus is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period the fair value of stock options is measured using a blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the use of several estimates including expected term expected riskfree interest rate expected volatility and expected dividend yield the fair value of the restricted stock is determined using the closing price of the companys common stock on the grant date the fair value of psus is determined on the grant date using the monte carlo simulation model 

option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the fouryear vesting period psus are generally expensed ratably over the threeyear vesting period we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1 2005 which requires that stockbased compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 

goodwill and intangibles 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets  this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value 

as of december 31 2018  we had goodwill of 33615 million  which represents 570 of our total assets during 2018  we performed an impairment test as of june 30 2018  and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing including an estimate of future expected revenues earnings and cash flows useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to 

estimate fair value we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units to mitigate undue influence we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill there have been no goodwill impairment indicators subsequent to the impairment test performed as of june 30 2018  for the year ended december 31 2018  there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets 

we allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets the estimates used in valuing the intangible assets are determined with the assistance of third party specialists a discounted cash flow analysis and estimates made by management management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

income taxes 

in projecting future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of asc 740  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this interpretation we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 

we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and job act “tax act” was enacted the tax act included a number of changes to us tax laws most notably a reduction in the us corporate tax rate from 350  to 210  as a result of the corporate tax rate reduction the company recognized a tax benefit in 2017 of 891 million  due to the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 118 the company completed the analysis of the impacts of the 2017 tax act in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulting in an incremental charge of 10 million  as income tax expense to reflect the final remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities of 881 million  

we estimate unrecognized tax positions of 09 million  that may be recognized by december 31 2019 due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities net of additional uncertain tax positions 

as of december 31 2018  we have gross federal state and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of 1865 million  which will expire at various dates from 2019 through 2038 such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows 



the net deferred income tax liability of 3395 million  consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2018 we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of 4150 million  which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1125  to 1625 depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax income and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instruments based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2018  a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 42 million based on our current borrowing levels 

foreign currency risk 

our foreignbased businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates a portion of our revenue is denominated in british pounds and other foreign currencies if the us dollar strengthens against british pounds and other foreign currencies our revenues reported in us dollars would decline with regard to operating expense our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in british pounds and other foreign currencies if british pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen costs reported in us dollars will increase movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  a hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings

because our business involves the distribution of certain personal public and nonpublic data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility service and marketing decisions based on such data certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws in the us and to a lesser extent in foreign countries examples of such regulation include the fair credit reporting act which regulates the use of consumer credit report information the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of non public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions the drivers privacy protection act which prohibits the public disclosure use or resale by any state’s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record except for a “permissible purpose” and various other federal state and local laws and regulations 

those laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used to challenge the accuracy of such information andor to prevent the use and disclosure of such information in certain instances the laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances 

we are also licensed as a rating rate service advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all 50 states puerto rico guam the us virgin islands and the district of columbia as such an advisory organization we provide statistical actuarial policy language development and related products and services to pc insurers including advisory prospective loss costs other prospective cost information manual rules and policy language we also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policy writing and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators 

many of our products services and operations as well as insurers use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the mccarranferguson act as a result many of our operations and products are subject to review andor approval by state regulators furthermore our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes which are typically enforced by state attorneys general andor insurance regulators

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to invest in any of our securities if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer in such case the trading price of our securities including our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions 

we depend upon data from external sources including data received from customers and various government and public record services for information used in our databases in general we do not own the information in these databases and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons and we could also become subject to legislative judicial or contractual restrictions on the use of such data in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way that allows us to legally use andor process the data in addition some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company specifically a portion of common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers if our customers’ percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms if a substantial number of data sources or certain key sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

agreements with our data suppliers are shortterm agreements some suppliers are also competitors which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors an advantage such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute data sources 

fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation 

security breaches in our facilities computer networks and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss 

thirdparty contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information if users gain improper access to our databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify confidential thirdparty information that is stored or transmitted on our networks our business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access our network products and services our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks 

in addition customers’ employees’ or other’s misuse of andor gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers any such misappropriation andor misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us among other things being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation 

a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways 

 incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed or any other security or privacy breaches may occur and could go undetected the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown any such incident could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from us pc primary insurers if there is a downturn in the us insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions our revenues will decline 

revenues derived from solutions we provide to us pc primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2017  approximately 489 of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to us pc primary insurers also invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the us pc insurance market which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry that are beyond our control in addition our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions 

factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by pc primary insurers include the following 

 a downturn in the insurance industry pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

acquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions 

our longterm business strategy includes growth through acquisitions future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful investments any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in the acquisitions of businesses such risks include among other things 



 the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition 

we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities although we have capacity under committed facilities those may not be sufficient therefore future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in dilution 

in addition to the extent we cannot identify or consummate on terms acceptable to us acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth 

there may be consolidation in our end customer market which could reduce the use of our services 

mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon for example in the pc insurance sector any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions our business could suffer serious harm 

our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions if we are unable to develop new solutions or if we are not successful in introducing andor obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate in addition significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in the past we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions primarily due to difficulties in developing models acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments errors or defects in our solutions that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection of our solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenues diversion of development resources an increase in product liability claims and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims 

we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them our business could be harmed 

our success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights to date we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology this protection of our proprietary technology is limited and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent in addition patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage any disclosure loss invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and ultimately our business our protection of our intellectual property rights in the us or abroad may not be adequate and others including our competitors may use our proprietary technology without our consent furthermore litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face claims for intellectual property infringement which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers 

there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings particularly in the us regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry there is a risk that we are infringing or may in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties we monitor thirdparty patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate however such monitoring and analysis has not been and is unlikely in the future to be comprehensive and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications since the patent application process can take several years to complete there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies as a result we may infringe existing and future thirdparty patents of which we are not aware as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 

thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions even if we prevail litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management’s time and attention 

if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop noninfringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

because personal public and nonpublic information is stored in some of our databases we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act grammleachbliley act driver’s privacy protection act the european union’s data protection directive and its successor the general data protection regulation the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent various other federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace however many consumer advocates privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information particularly social security numbers department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth as a result they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data in addition on october 6 2015 the court of justice of the european union or eu invalidated the safe harbor provisions used by the company and numerous other us businesses to comply with eu’s data protection directive 9546ec the company has implemented various measures to comply with the data protection directive and the forthcoming general data protection regulation however there can be no assurances that such methods will not be invalidated as well if the company is unable to comply with the transfer mechanisms adopted pursuant to the data protection directive and the forthcoming general data protection regulation it will impede the ability to conduct business between the us and the eu which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that require significant resource commitments which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may lose key business assets through the loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links the internet or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 

our operations depend on our ability as well as that of thirdparty service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure fire flood power loss telecommunications failure impacts of terrorism breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers natural disasters or other disasters certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding earthquakes or other disasters the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers in addition we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time any damage to our data centers failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements resulting in decreased revenue operating income and earnings per share 

we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively 

some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive and are expected to remain highly competitive we compete on the basis of quality customer service product and service selection and pricing our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment due to their size certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can as a result these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences emerging technologies and market trends in addition new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away and as we enter into new lines of business due to acquisition or otherwise we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments especially against larger competitors we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete if we fail to successfully compete our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases the demand for some of our solutions may decrease 

public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce the demand for our solutions to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our financial position may be impacted by audit examinations or changes in tax laws or tax rulings 

our existing corporate structure and tax positions have been implemented in a manner in which we believe is compliant with current prevailing tax laws however changes in existing tax laws or rulings including federal state and international could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate cash tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities audit examinations with an adverse outcome could have a negative effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate furthermore the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd released its base erosion and profit shifting beps action plans which may also lead to future tax reform that could affect our results in addition our tax positions are impacted by fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries in which we do business 

our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 

our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace 

however as a general practice we do not enter into employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team except for certain limited situations if we lose key members of our senior management operating team we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers 

our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees if our attrition rate increases our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work 

if our business continues to grow the number of people we will need to hire will increase we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs 

we are subject to antitrust consumer protection and other litigation and may in the future become further subject to such litigation an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

we participate in businesses particularly insurancerelated businesses and services that are subject to substantial litigation including antitrust and consumer protection litigation in addition our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability given the nature of our business we may be subject to similar litigation in the future even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth 

general economic political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business 

the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of wood mackenzie 

in order to finance acquisitions which are an important part of our long term growth strategy we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and such increased leverage could adversely affect our business in particular the increased leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue other operational and strategic opportunities the increased leverage potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

general economic uncertainties including downward trends in the energy industry could reduce demand by wood mackenzie’s customers for its products and services 

demand for wood mackenzie’s products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties particularly any downward trends in the energy industry many factors could negatively affect the revenues profits and discretionary spending of wood mackenzie’s customers such factors include commodity prices in particular oil and coal the state of the local economy interest rates currency exchange rates political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations the availability of industry resources and other matters a downturn or perceived downturn in the economy 

particularly the energy industry could add pricing pressure delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by wood mackenzie’s customers which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations 

wood mackenzie is based in the united kingdom or uk and conducts its principal operations outside the us as a result the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the us has increased materially conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws legal standards regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers unexpected changes in regulatory requirements taxes trade laws tariffs export quotas custom duties or other trade restrictions differing technology standards difficulties in collecting accounts receivable difficulties in managing and staffing international operations varying expectations as to employee standards potentially adverse tax consequences including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries moreover international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war and other economic or political uncertainties all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations 

the revenues and costs of wood mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling as a result of our acquisition of wood mackenzie we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies as exchange rates vary revenue cost of revenue operating expenses and other operating results when remeasured in us dollars may differ materially from expectations although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own such as ongoing management time and expertise external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications 

economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the uk’s exit from the eu could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

the results of the referendum on june 23 2016 in the uk to exit the eu which is commonly referred to as “brexit” and to potentially significantly change the uk’s relationship with the eu and the laws and regulations impacting business conducted between the uk and eu countries could disrupt the overall stability of the eu given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual eu countries and negatively impact our european operations an immediate consequence of the brexit vote was an adverse impact to global markets including currency markets which experienced a sharp drop in the value of the british pound longer term brexit will require negotiations regarding the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu which could result in the uk losing access to certain aspects of the single eu market and the global trade deals negotiated by the eu on behalf of its members the brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the uk may adversely affect business activity political stability and economic conditions in the uk the eu and elsewhere the impact of which could have an adverse effect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if there are substantial sales of our common stock our stock price could decline 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive as of december 31 2017  our ten largest shareholders owned 410 of our common stock including 44 of our common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration and subject to limitations on the timing amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly in addition the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

pursuant to our equity incentive plans options to purchase approximately 8703249 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 16 2018  we filed a registration statement under the securities act which covers the shares 

available for issuance under our equity incentive plans including for such outstanding options as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

also in the future we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 

our capital structure level of indebtedness and the terms of antitakeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us as a public company we are subject to section 203 which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 150 or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions but we do not intend to do so 

these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future

we enable our customers to make better decisions about risk investments and operations with greater precision efficiency and discipline we also help customers across the globe protect and grow the value of people property and financial assets we provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that combined with our analytic methods creates embedded decision support solutions we are one of the largest aggregators and providers of data pertaining to us property and casualty or pc insurance risks we offer predictive analytics and decision support solutions to customers in rating underwriting claims catastrophe and weather risk global risk analytics natural resources intelligence and many other fields refer to item 1 business for further discussion

executive summary 

key performance metrics 

we believe our business’s ability to grow recurring revenue and generate positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy we use yearoveryear revenue and ebitda growth as metrics to measure our performance ebitda and ebitda margin are nongaap financial measures see note 2 within item 6 selected financial data section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the respective gaap financial measures are net income and net income margin 

revenue growth  we use yearoveryear revenue growth as a key performance metric we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers sales to new customers sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses 

ebitda growth  we use ebitda growth as a proxy for the cash generated by the business ebitda growth serves as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth 

ebitda margin  we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth 

revenues 

we earn revenues through subscriptions longterm agreements and on a transactional basis recurring and nonrecurring subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year as a result the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period in general we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business our longterm agreements are generally for periods of three to five years we recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most longterm agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 

certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis for example we have solutions that allow our customers to obtain propertyspecific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building or compare a pc insurance medical or workers’ compensation claim with information in our databases we also provide advisory services which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  192 and 165 of our revenues were derived from providing transactional recurring and nonrecurring solutions respectively we earn these revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed in general they are billed monthly at the end of each month 

for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  752 and 786 of the revenues in our decision analytics segment were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions respectively for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  908 and 920 of the revenues in our risk assessment segment were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions respectively our customers in this segment include most of the pc insurance providers in the us 

principal operating costs and expenses 

personnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses which represented 501 and 477 of our total expenses for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively include salaries benefits incentive compensation equity compensation costs sales commissions employment taxes recruiting costs and outsourced temporary agency costs 

we allocate personnel expenses between two categories cost of revenues and selling general and administrative costs based on the actual costs associated with each employee we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues and all other personnel including executive managers sales people marketing business development finance legal human resources and administrative services as selling general and administrative expenses a significant portion of our other operating costs such as facilities and communications are either captured within cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed 

while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues 

historically our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses however part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions which may offset margin expansion 

cost of revenues  our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our nextgeneration solutions our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization 

selling general and administrative expense  our selling general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities insurance and communications are allocated to selling general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee our selling general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization 

trends affecting our business 

we serve customers in three primary vertical markets pc insurance energy and financial services the industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business 

 a significant change in pc insurers’ profitability could affect the demand for our solutions for insurers the keys to profitability include increasing investment income premium growth and disciplined underwriting of risks investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates growth in pc insurers’ direct written premiums is cyclical with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 148 in 2002 to a trough of negative 31 in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 44 in 2012 43 in 2013 44 in 2014 37 in 2015 and 37 in 2016 in recent years we have signed multiyear contracts with certain customers and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multiyear period pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years premiums 

based on our experience insurers more closely scrutinize their spending in periods of more challenging growth and tend to focus on making an underwriting profit in addition 2017 has been a challenging year for insurers with the catastrophe losses related to the three major hurricanes  harvey irma and maria  making landfall in the us in the third quarter 2017 causing insurance industry’s net income to decline these events also illustrate the need for broader coverages such as flood to meet the changing needs of communities we continue to provide the necessary resources to meet insurer needs 

trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers’ profitability and therefore on their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of weather events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling catastrophe loss information and repair cost solutions likewise any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from the recent influx of alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products we also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity the need by our customers to fight insurance fraud  both in claims and at policy inception  could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions 

trends in the energy chemicals and metals and mining sectors and activity in financial markets can influence our revenues during 2017 oil prices showed a modest improvement and we expect a continued sense of optimism in the energy markets in 2018 in the upstream sector there are five global trends first capital investments are anticipated to grow moderately in 2018 signaling an end to the period of reductions since 2014 second there is a surge in tight oil production in 2018 driven by a considerable increase from the permian basin in the us a region benefiting from new fracking production technology third oversupplies in the service sector provide an opportunity for operators to lock in prices below historical market rates fourth opportunities from discovered resources and exploration have been increasingly undertaken several middle eastern countries expect to award significant contracts to further develop discovered resources in addition there will likely be growing interest in latin american opportunities fifth many countries are reviewing their existing fiscal policies to ensure that they are competitive as well as developing new terms to attract investment in new opportunities in terms of the wider energy sector we foresee the continued growth of the electric vehicle market albeit from a low base which is anticipated to develop into one of the most disruptive forces in the sector falling renewable energy costs around the world will also underpin the ongoing shift towards a low carbon economy we will continue to evolve our offerings to meet the needs of our customers in a dynamic market and remain increasingly well positioned to serve our customers information and analytical needs 

market trends continue to influence our financial services vertical in important ways as we look forward towards 2018 increasing trends in delinquency and fraud rates have resulted in an increased demand for robust risk solutions in order to better serve our customers add to our data asset and expand our expertise we made a number of strategic acquisitions in the 

past year most importantly 1 g2 which provides merchant risk intelligence solutions for acquirers commercial banks and their value chain partners g2 provides solutions to manage and monitor merchant and business risk within an increasingly complex payments ecosystem using advanced artificial intelligence technologies combined with expert analysts 2 lci a company that provides bankruptcy management solutions to improve customers profitability through recovery of bankrupt accounts while protecting the customers brand by conforming to industry compliance lci maintains bankruptcy data servicing more than 13 billion accounts bankruptcy process automation software expert services and research to automate expensive processes in the bankruptcy lifecycle 3 fintellix a company that provides risk and regulatory reporting solutions to enterprise banks at a significantly lower cost of compliance as well as jumpstarting analytics capabilities in smaller and regional banks we stand confident of our position with these acquisitions with the proprietary data and solutions we offer to help our customers achieve their business and regulatory objectives

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and intangible assets pension and other post retirement benefits stock based compensation and income taxes actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company’s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered fees andor price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term usually one year revenues from transactionbased fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

the company also has termbased software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is postcontract customer support or pcs including unspecified upgrade rights on a whenandif available basis the company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term the pcs associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term the company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include pcs and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term in addition the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our customers on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances 

we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 

we invoice our customers in annual quarterly or monthly installments amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenues on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met 

stockbased compensation 

the fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the use of several estimates including expected term expected riskfree interest rate expected volatility and expected dividend yield 

stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the fouryear vesting period we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1 2005 which requires that stockbased compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 

goodwill and intangibles 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets  this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value 

as of december 31 2017  we had goodwill of 33687 million  which represents 560 of our total assets during 2017  we performed an impairment test as of june 30 2017  and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary as part of this process we conducted the annual impairment test of our energy reporting unit at june 30 2017 at which time the fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 100 this outcome is consistent with our expectation due to the decline in the gbpusd exchange rate as well as current energy market conditions the carrying value of the goodwill associated with our energy reporting unit was 18418 million as of june 30 2017 

there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing including an estimate of future expected revenues earnings and cash flows useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units to mitigate undue influence we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill there have been no goodwill impairment indicators subsequent to the impairment test performed as of june 30 2017  for the year ended december 31 2017  there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets 

we allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets the estimates used in valuing the intangible assets are determined with the assistance of third party specialists a discounted cash flow analysis and estimates made by management management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and 

liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

pension and postretirement 

we account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  this standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive loss net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit credit cost 

certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit credit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize quoted rates from longterm bond indices and changes in longterm bond rates over the past year cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees as part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better at the measurement date the output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year’s discount rate and quoted rates for longterm bond indices for our pension plans at december 31 2017  we determined this rate to be 350  a decrease of 049 from the 399  rate used at december 31 2016  our postretirement rate was 300  at december 31 2017  a decrease of 025 from the 325  rate used at december 31 2016  

the expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader longterm forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation and the current economic environment our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 400  debt securities and 600  equity securities as of december 31 2017  the pension plan assets were allocated 379  debt 540  equity securities and 81  other the veba plan target allocation is 100 debt we have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan the expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit credits costs we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 the future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under medicare part d was effectively changed this legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan we are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted 

a one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects 



income taxes 

in projecting future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of asc 740  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this interpretation we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 

we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

on december 22 2017 president trump signed comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and job act or tax act the tax act makes complex changes to the tax law which will impact the 2017 year including but not limited to 1 a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the corporate tax rate change from 350  to 210  2 100  bonus depreciation on qualifying property placed in service after september 27 2017 and 3 requiring a onetime repatriation tax on foreign earnings 

based on our initial analysis of the tax act we have made reasonable estimates of its 2017 impact and have recorded provisional adjustments as follows 

 the tax act will also affect 2018 and forward including but not limited to 1 a reduction in the federal corporate rate from 350  to 210  2 elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax 3 creation of a new minimum tax  the base erosion antiabuse tax or beat 4 a general elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 5 a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income or gilti 6 a new limitation on deductible interest expense 7 the repeal of section 199 domestic production activity deduction 8 a new limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 9 limitations on net operating losses or nol’s generated after december 31 2017 10 a special deduction for foreign derived intangible income or fdii and various other items we have evaluated the above provisions and other than the reduction in corporate tax rate we do not believe that the new provisions will have a material impact on the provision for income taxes 

we estimate unrecognized tax positions of 05 million that may be recognized by december 31 2018 due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities net of additional uncertain tax positions 

as of december 31 2017  we have gross federal state and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of 2115 million which will expire at various dates from 2018 through 2037 such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows 



the net deferred income tax liability of 3219 million  consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2017  we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of 7150 million  which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1125  to 1625  depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax income and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instruments based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2017  a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 72 million based on our current borrowing levels 

foreign currency risk 

our foreignbased businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates a portion of our revenue is denominated in british pounds and other foreign currencies if the us dollar strengthens against british pounds and other foreign currencies our revenues reported in us dollars would decline with regard to operating expense our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in british pounds and other foreign currencies if british pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen costs reported in us dollars will increase movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  a hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings

our history 

we trace our history to 1971 when insurance services office inc or iso started operations as a notforprofit advisory and rating organization providing services to the us pc insurance industry iso was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators as required by law iso’s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development underwriting and rating functions 

over the past two decades we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets 

our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the american insurance services group or aisg and certain operations and assets of the national insurance crime bureau in 1997 and 1998 respectively those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud to further expand our business in 2002 we acquired air worldwide or air the technological leader in catastrophe modeling in 2006 to bolster our position in the insurance claims field we acquired xactware a leading supplier of estimation software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction in 2012 we acquired argus information  advisory services llc or argus to expand our global presence providing information competitive benchmarking analytics and customized services to financial institutions in the payments space in 2015 we acquired wood mackenzie limited or wood mackenzie to advance our strategy to expand internationally and position us in the global energy market 

those acquisitions have added scale geographic reach highly skilled workforces and a wide array of new capabilities to support our customers they have helped to make us a leading provider of information and decision analytics for customers involved in the business of risk in the us and selectively around the world 

on may 23 2008 in contemplation of our initial public offering or ipo iso formed verisk analytics inc or verisk a delaware corporation to be the holding company for our business verisk was initially formed as a whollyowned subsidiary of iso on october 6 2009 in connection with our ipo the company effected a reorganization whereby iso became a whollyowned subsidiary of verisk verisk common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on october 7 2009 under the symbol “vrsk” 

segments 

we organize our business in two segments risk assessment and decision analytics see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii of this annual report for additional information regarding our segments see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information 

risk assessment segment 

our risk assessment segment serves our pc insurance customers and focuses on prediction of loss selection and pricing of risk and compliance with their reporting requirements in each us state in which they operate our customers include most of the pc insurance providers in the us in recent years we have expanded our offerings to also serve certain nonus markets 

industrystandard insurance programs 

we are the recognized leader in the us for industrystandard insurance programs that help pc insurers define coverages and issue policies we provide policy language prospective loss costs policy writing rules and a variety of other solutions for 26 lines of insurance our policy language prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language rules and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements insurers must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law to meet their needs we process approximately 2400 regulatory filings and interface with state regulators in all 50 states plus the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands each year to ensure smooth implementation of our rules and forms when insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs our industrystandard insurance programs also help regulators ensure that such insurers’ policies meet basic coverage requirements 

standardized coverage language which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants as a result our industrystandard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known our policy language includes standard coverage language endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they offer with these policy programs insurers also benefit from economies of scale we have more than 120 specialized lawyers and insurance experts reviewing changes in each state’s insurance rules and regulations including an average of more than 16500 legislative bills 6100 regulatory actions and 2000 court cases per year to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information 

to cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace we offer a broad range of policy programs for example in the homeowners line of insurance we maintain policy language and rules for 6 basic coverages 289 national endorsements and 601 statespecific endorsements 

the pc insurance industry is heavily regulated in the us pc insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate our statistical agent services have enabled pc insurers to meet those regulatory requirements for more than 45 years we aggregate the data and as a licensed or appointed “statistical agent” in all 50 states puerto rico and the district of columbia we report those statistics to insurance regulators we are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the us pc insurance industry 

to provide our customers and the regulators the information they require we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world over the past four decades we have developed core expertise in acquiring processing managing and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our risk assessment segment we use our proprietary technology to assemble organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers we supplement this data with publicly available information 

each year pc insurers send us approximately 35 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred we maintain a database of more than 200 billion statistical records including approximately 82 billion commercial lines records and approximately 118 billion personal lines records we collect unit transaction detail of each premium and loss record which enhances the validity reliability and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial analyses our proprietary quality process includes more than 2800 separate checks to ensure that the data meets our high standards of quality 

we provide actuarial services to help our customers analyze and price their risks using our large database of premium and loss data our actuaries are able to perform sophisticated analyses using our predictive models and analytic methods to help our pc insurance customers with pricing loss reserving and marketing we distribute a number of actuarial solutions and offer flexible services to meet our customers’ needs in addition our actuarial consultants provide customized services for our customers that include assisting them with the development of independent insurance programs analysis of their own underwriting experience development of classification systems and rating plans and a wide variety of other business decisions we also supply information to a wide variety of customers in other markets including reinsurance and government agencies 

we project customers future losses and loss expenses using a broad set of data those projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used their own data exclusively we make a number of actuarial adjustments before the data is used to estimate future costs our customers can use our estimates of future costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies for most pc insurers in most lines of business we believe our estimates of future costs are an essential input to rating decisions our actuarial products and services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industrystandard insurance programs described above 

by building on our insurance industry expertise and recent acquisitions we have expanded our solution set to serve customers in certain nonus markets

our competitors 

we believe no single competitor currently offers the same scope of services and market coverage we provide the breadth of markets we serve exposes us to a broad range of competitors as described below businesses that we acquire may introduce us to additional competitors 

risk assessment competitors 

our risk assessment segment operates primarily in the us pc insurance industry where we enjoy a leading market presence we have a number of competitors in specific lines or services 

we encounter competition from a number of sources including insurers that develop internal technology and actuarial methods for proprietary insurance programs competitors also include other statistical agents including the national independent statistical service the independent statistical service inc and other advisory organizations that provide underwriting rules prospective loss costs and coverage language such as the american association of insurance services inc and mutual services organization however we believe none of our competitors have the breadth or depth of data we have 

competitors for our propertyspecific rating and underwriting information are primarily limited to a number of regional providers of commercial property inspections and surveys including overland solutions inc and regional reporting inc we also compete with a variety of organizations that offer consulting services primarily specialty technology and consulting firms in addition a customer may use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm for these services our competitors also include information technology product and services vendors management and strategy consulting firms such as deloitte consulting llp and smaller specialized information technology and analytical services firms including pinnacle consulting and emb a unit of willis towers watson 

decision analytics competitors

development of new solutions 

we take a marketfocused team approach to developing our solutions our operating units are responsible for developing reviewing and enhancing our various products and services our data management and production team designs and manages our processes and systems for market data procurement proprietary data production and quality control our joint development environment or jde and enterprise data management or edm teams support our efforts to create new information and products from available data and explore new methods of collecting data edm is focused on understanding and documenting businessunit and corporate data assets and data issues sharing and combining data assets across the enterprise creating an enterprise data strategy facilitating research and product development and promoting crossenterprise communication our verisk innovative analytics or via team is a corporate center of excellence for analytical methods in applying modeling techniques to predict risk outcomes 

our software development teams build the technology used in many of our solutions as part of our productdevelopment process we continually solicit feedback from our customers on the value of our products and services and the market’s needs we have established an extensive system of customer advisory panels that meet regularly throughout the year to help us respond effectively to the needs of our markets in addition we use frequent sales calls executive visits user group meetings and other industry forums to gather information to match our product development efforts with the needs of the market we also use a variety of market research techniques to enhance our understanding of our customers and the markets in which they operate 

we add to our offerings through an active acquisition program since 2012 we have acquired 15  businesses which have allowed us to enter new markets offer new solutions and enhance the value of existing services with additional proprietary sources of data 

when we find it advantageous we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings this approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows 

sales marketing and customer support 

we sell our solutions and services primarily through direct interaction with our customers we employ a threetier sales structure that includes salespeople technical consultants and sales support as of december 31 2016  we had a sales force of 295 people in our continuing operations within the company several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services those specialized sales teams sell specific highly technical solution sets to targeted markets in coordination with account management 

  

to provide account management to our largest customers in the insurance financial and energy markets we segment our customers into three groups tier one or “globalnational” accounts is comprised of our largest customers tier two or “strategic” accounts represent both large and middlemarket customer groups tier three is comprised of small and specialized companies that may represent one line of business or may be regionally focused in tier one and tier two segments we have sales teams organized by the following specialities rating underwriting claims catastrophe risk and energy in the tier three segment we assign a sales generalist with overall account management responsibility our tiered approach has proven to be a successful sales model and approach to building customer relationships our senior executives regularly engage with the senior management of our customers to ensure customer satisfaction and strategic alignment and to support mutual innovation partnership opportunities 

sales people participate in both customerservice and sales activities they provide direct support interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a satisfactory experience using our services salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activities and provide the best solutions for our customers we believe our salespeople’s product knowledge skills to develop relationships of trust and local presence differentiate us from our competition technical consultants are subjectmatter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products and segments both salespeople and technical consultants have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities a team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination among the groups 

sources of our data 

the data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions are sourced through six different kinds of data arrangements first we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions 

created from their data those agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt it is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data second we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide their required levels of privacy protection of data and where necessary deidentification of data the agreements represent no cost to us generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and required renewal third we “mine” data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions as an example we use the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models again those arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way fourth we source data generally at no cost from public sources including federal state and local governments fifth we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff members who also perform property surveys at the request of and facilitated by property insurers lastly we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased including county tax assessor records descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses we are the owners of the derivative solutions we create using the data we collect 

information technology 

technology 

our information technology systems and the more recent adoption of cloud computing are fundamental to our success they are used for the storage processing access and delivery of the data that forms the foundation of our business and the development and delivery of the solutions we provide to our customers much of the technology we use and provide to our customers is developed maintained and supported by approximately 25 of our employee population we generally own or have secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business all the customerfacing applications that are material to our operations we support and implement a mix of technologies and focus on implementing the most efficient technology for any given business requirement or task 

data centers 

we have two primary data centers in somerset new jersey and lehi utah creating redundancy and backup capabilities in addition we have data centers dedicated to certain business units located in other states 

disaster recovery 

we are committed to a framework for business continuity management and carry out annual reviews of the state of preparedness of each business unit all of our critical databases systems and contracted customer services are also regularly recovered we also have documented disaster recovery plans in place for each of our major data centers and each of our solutions the data center in somerset new jersey is the recovery site for the lehi utah data center and vice versa 

security 

we have adopted a wide range of measures to ensure the security of our it infrastructure and data security measures generally cover the following key areas physical security logical security of the perimeter network security such as firewalls logical access to the operating systems deployment of virus detection software and appropriate policies and procedures relating to removable media such as laptops all laptops are encrypted and media leaving our premises and sent to thirdparty storage facilities are also encrypted our commitment to security has earned from cybertrust security certification an industry leader in information security certification since 2002 

intellectual property 

we own a significant number of intellectual property rights including copyrights trademarks trade secrets and patents specifically our policy language insurance manuals software and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue we also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the us and foreign countries including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines many of which are registered we believe many of our trademarks trade names service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them we consider our intellectual property to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of statutory for example copyright trademark trade secret and patent and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect them wherever they are used 

we also own several software method and processing patents and have several pending patent applications in the us that complement our products the patents and patent applications include claims that pertain to technology including a patent 

for our iso claims outcome advisor ®  software and our xactware sketch ®  product we believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and that are material to our business 

to maintain control of our intellectual property we enter into license agreements with our customers granting each customer a license to use our products and services including our software and databases this helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions as a general practice employees contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights information and technology 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we employed 6148 fulltime and 166 parttime employees in our continuing operations none of our employees are represented by unions we consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 

our employees include more than 200 actuarial professionals including 39 fellows and 35 associates of the casualty actuarial society as well as 149 chartered property casualty underwriters 23 certified and 23 associate insurance data managers and more than 900 professionals with advanced degrees including phds in mathematics and statistical modeling who review both the data and the models 

regulation 

because our business involves the distribution of certain personal public and nonpublic data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility service and marketing decisions based on such data certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws in the us and to a lesser extent in foreign countries examples of such regulation include the fair credit reporting act which regulates the use of consumer credit report information the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of non public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions the drivers privacy protection act which prohibits the public disclosure use or resale by any state’s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record except for a “permissible purpose” and various other federal state and local laws and regulations 

those laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used to challenge the accuracy of such information andor to prevent the use and disclosure of such information in certain instances the laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances 

we are also licensed as a rating rate service advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all 50 states puerto rico guam the us virgin islands and the district of columbia as such an advisory organization we provide statistical actuarial policy language development and related products and services to propertycasualty insurers including advisory prospective loss costs other prospective cost information manual rules and policy language we also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policy writing and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators 

many of our products services and operations as well as insurers use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the mccarranferguson act as a result many of our operations and products are subject to review andor approval by state regulators furthermore our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes which are typically enforced by state attorneys general andor insurance regulators

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to invest in any of our securities if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer in such case the trading price of our securities including our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions 

we depend upon data from external sources including data received from customers and various government and public record services for information used in our databases in general we do not own the information in these databases and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons and we could also become subject to legislative judicial or contractual restrictions on the use of such data in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way that allows us to legally use andor process the data in addition some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company specifically a portion of common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers if our customers’ percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms if a substantial number of data sources or certain key sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

agreements with our data suppliers are shortterm agreements some suppliers are also competitors which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors an advantage such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute data sources 

fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation 

security breaches in our facilities computer networks and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems thirdparty contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information if users gain improper access to our databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify confidential thirdparty information that is stored or transmitted on our networks 

in addition customers’ employees’ or other’s misuse of andor gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers any such misappropriation andor misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us among other things being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation 

a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways 

 incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed or any other security or privacy breaches may occur and could go undetected the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown any such incident could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from us pc primary insurers if there is a downturn in the us insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions our revenues will decline 

revenues derived from solutions we provide to us pc primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2016  approximately 489 of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to us pc primary insurers also invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the us pc insurance market which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry that are beyond our control in addition our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions 

factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by pc primary insurers include the following 

 a downturn in the insurance industry pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

acquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions 

our longterm business strategy includes growth through acquisitions future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful investments any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in the acquisitions of businesses such risks include among other things 

 the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition 

we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities although we have capacity under committed facilities those may not be sufficient therefore future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in dilution 

in addition to the extent we cannot identify or consummate on terms acceptable to us acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth 

there may be consolidation in our end customer market which could reduce the use of our services 

mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon for example in the pc insurance sector any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions our business could suffer serious harm 

our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions if we are unable to develop new solutions or if we are not successful in introducing andor obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate in addition significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in the past we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions primarily due to difficulties in developing models acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments errors or defects in our solutions that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection of our solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenues diversion of development resources an increase in product liability claims and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims 

we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them our business could be harmed 

our success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights to date we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology this protection of our proprietary technology is limited and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent in addition patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage any disclosure loss invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and ultimately our business our protection of our intellectual property rights in the us or abroad may not be adequate and others including our competitors may use our proprietary technology without our consent furthermore litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face claims for intellectual property infringement which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers 

there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings particularly in the us regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry there is a risk that we are infringing or may in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties we monitor thirdparty patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate however such monitoring and analysis has not been and is unlikely in the future to be comprehensive and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications since the patent application process can take several years to complete there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies as a result we may infringe existing and future thirdparty patents of which we are not aware as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 

thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or 

operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions even if we prevail litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management’s time and attention 

if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop noninfringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

because personal public and nonpublic information is stored in some of our databases we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act grammleachbliley act driver’s privacy protection act the european union’s data protection directive the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent various other federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace however many consumer advocates privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information particularly social security numbers department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth as a result they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data in addition on october 6 2015 the court of justice of the european union or eu invalidated the safe harbor provisions used by the company and numerous other us businesses to comply with eu’s data protection directive 9546ec the company has implemented various measures to comply with the data protection directive however there can be no assurances that such methods will not be invalidated as well if the company is unable to comply with the transfer mechanisms adopted pursuant to the data protection directive it will impede the ability to conduct business between the us and the eu which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that require significant resource commitments which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may lose key business assets through the loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links the internet or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 

our operations depend on our ability as well as that of thirdparty service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure fire flood power loss telecommunications failure impacts of terrorism breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers natural disasters or other disasters certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding earthquakes or other disasters the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers in addition we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time any damage to our data centers failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements resulting in decreased revenue operating income and earnings per share 

we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively 

some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive and are expected to remain highly competitive we compete on the basis of quality customer service product and service selection and pricing our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment due to their size certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can as a result these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences emerging technologies and market trends in addition new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away and as we enter into new lines of business due to acquisition or otherwise we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments especially against larger competitors we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete if we fail to successfully compete our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases the demand for some of our solutions may decrease 

public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce the demand for our solutions to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our financial position may be impacted by audit examinations or changes in tax laws or tax rulings 

our existing corporate structure and tax positions have been implemented in a manner in which we believe is compliant with current prevailing tax laws however changes in existing tax laws or rulings including federal state and international could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate cash tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities audit examinations with an adverse outcome could have a negative effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate furthermore the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd released its base erosion and profit shifting beps action plans which may also lead to future tax reform that could affect our results in addition our tax positions are impacted by fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries in which we do business 

our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 

our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace 

however as a general practice we do not enter into employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team except for certain limited situations if we lose key members of our senior management operating team we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers 

our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees if our attrition rate increases our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work 

if our business continues to grow the number of people we will need to hire will increase we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs 

we are subject to antitrust consumer protection and other litigation and may in the future become further subject to such litigation an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

we participate in businesses particularly insurancerelated businesses and services that are subject to substantial litigation including antitrust and consumer protection litigation in addition our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability given the nature of our business we may be subject to similar litigation in the future even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth 

general economic political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business 

the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of wood mackenzie 

in order to finance acquisitions which are an important part of our long term growth strategy  we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and such increased leverage could adversely affect our business in particular the increased leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue other operational and strategic opportunities the increased leverage potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

general economic uncertainties including downward trends in the energy industry could reduce demand by wood mackenzie’s customers for its products and services 

demand for wood mackenzie’s products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties particularly any downward trends in the energy industry many factors could negatively affect the revenues profits and discretionary spending of wood mackenzie’s customers such factors include commodity prices in particular oil and coal the state of the local economy interest rates currency exchange rates political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations the availability of industry resources and other matters a downturn or perceived downturn in the economy particularly the energy industry could add pricing pressure delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by wood mackenzie’s customers which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations 

wood mackenzie is based in the united kingdom or uk and conducts its principal operations outside the us as a result the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the us has increased materially conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws legal standards regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers unexpected changes in regulatory requirements taxes trade laws tariffs export quotas custom duties or other trade restrictions differing technology standards difficulties in collecting accounts receivable difficulties in managing and staffing international operations varying expectations as to employee standards potentially adverse tax consequences including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and reduced or 

varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries moreover international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war and other economic or political uncertainties all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations 

the revenues and costs of wood mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling as a result of the acquisition we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies as exchange rates vary revenue cost of revenue operating expenses and other operating results when remeasured in us dollars may differ materially from expectations although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own such as ongoing management time and expertise external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications 

economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the uk’s exit from the eu could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

the results of the referendum on june 23 2016 in the uk to exit the eu which is commonly referred to as “brexit” and to potentially significantly change the uk’s relationship with the eu and the laws and regulations impacting business conducted between the uk and eu countries could disrupt the overall stability of the eu given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual eu countries and negatively impact our european operations an immediate consequence of the brexit vote was an adverse impact to global markets including currency markets which experienced a sharp drop in the value of the british pound longer term brexit will require negotiations regarding the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu which could result in the uk losing access to certain aspects of the single eu market and the global trade deals negotiated by the eu on behalf of its members the brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the uk may adversely affect business activity political stability and economic conditions in the uk the eu and elsewhere the impact of which could have an adverse effect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if there are substantial sales of our common stock our stock price could decline 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive as of december 31 2016  our ten largest shareholders owned 396 of our common stock including 51 of our common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration and subject to limitations on the timing amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly in addition the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

pursuant to our equity incentive plans options to purchase approximately 8666698 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 17 2017  we filed a registration statement under the securities act which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans including for such outstanding options as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

also in the future we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 

our capital structure level of indebtedness and the terms of antitakeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be 

beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us as a public company we are subject to section 203 which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 150 or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions but we do not intend to do so 

these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k as well as the discussion under “selected consolidated financial data” this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including but not limited to those listed under “risk factors” and “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

we enable our customers to make better decisions about risk investments and operations with greater precision efficiency and discipline we also help customers across the globe protect and grow the value of people property and financial assets we provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that combined with our analytic methods creates embedded decision support solutions we are one of the largest aggregators and providers of data pertaining to us property and casualty or pc insurance risks we offer predictive analytics and decision support solutions to customers in rating underwriting claims catastrophe and weather risk global risk analytics natural resources intelligence and many other fields refer to item 1 business for further discussion 

our customers use our solutions to make better decisions with greater efficiency and discipline we refer to these products and services as “solutions” due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products these solutions take various forms including data statistical models or tailored analytics all designed to allow our customers to make more logical decisions we believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers’ revenues and help them better manage their costs 

we organize our business in two segments risk assessment and decision analytics our risk assessment segment provides statistical actuarial and underwriting data for the us pc insurance industry our risk assessment segment revenues represented 363 and 391 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively our decision analytics segment provides solutions to our customer in insurance energy and specialized markets and financial services our decision analytics segment revenues represented approximately 637 and 609 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively

executive summary 

key performance metrics 

we believe our business’s ability to grow recurring revenue and generate positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy we use yearoveryear revenue and ebitda growth as metrics to measure our performance ebitda and ebitda margin are nongaap financial measures see note 2 within item 6 selected financial data section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the respective gaap financial measures are net income and net income margin 

revenue growth  we use yearoveryear revenue growth as a key performance metric we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers sales to new customers sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses 

ebitda growth  we use ebitda growth as a proxy for the cash generated by the business ebitda growth serves as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth 

ebitda margin  we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth 

revenues 

we earn revenues through subscriptions longterm agreements and on a transactional basis recurring and nonrecurring subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year as a result the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period in general we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business our longterm agreements are generally for periods of three to five years we recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most longterm agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 

certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis for example we have solutions that allow our customers to obtain propertyspecific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building or compare a pc insurance medical or workers’ compensation claim with information in our databases we also provide advisory services which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  165 and 172 of our revenues were derived from providing transactional recurring and nonrecurring solutions respectively we earn these revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed in general they are billed monthly at the end of each month 

for the the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  920 and 901 of the revenues in our risk assessment segment were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions respectively our customers in this segment include most of the pc insurance providers in the us for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  786  and 781 of the revenues in our decision analytics segment were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions respectively 

principal operating costs and expenses 

personnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses which represented 477 and 465 of our total expenses for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively include salaries benefits incentive compensation equity compensation costs sales commissions employment taxes recruiting costs and outsourced temporary agency costs 

we allocate personnel expenses between two categories cost of revenues and selling general and administrative costs based on the actual costs associated with each employee we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues and all other personnel including executive managers sales people marketing business development finance legal human resources and administrative services as selling general and administrative expenses a significant portion of our other operating costs such as facilities and communications are either captured within cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed 

while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues 

historically our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses however part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions which may offset margin expansion 

cost of revenues  our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our nextgeneration solutions our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization 

selling general and administrative expense  our selling general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities insurance and communications are allocated to selling general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee our selling general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization 

trends affecting our business 

we serve customers in three primary vertical markets pc insurance energy and financial services the industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business 

 a significant change in pc insurers’ profitability could affect the demand for our solutions for insurers the keys to profitability include investment income and premium growth investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates growth in pc insurers’ direct written premiums is cyclical with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 148 in 2002 to a trough of negative 31 in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 44 in 2012 43 in 2013 44 in 2014 and 37 in 2015 based on our experience insurers more closely scrutinize their spending in periods of more challenging growth in recent years we have signed multiyear contracts with certain customers and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multiyear period pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years premiums 

trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers’ profitability and therefore their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of weather events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling catastrophe loss information and repair cost solutions likewise any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from the recent influx of alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products we also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity the need by our customers to fight insurance fraud  both in claims and at policy inception  could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions 

trends in the energy chemicals and metals and mining sectors and activity in financial markets can influence our revenues movements of commodity prices affect the profitability of our customers which include energy chemicals and metals and mining companies while stock markets and mergers and acquisitions or ma are some of the principal drivers affecting our financial institution customers among the trends influencing commodity prices are supply and demand factors regulatory requirements fiscal impacts regional market structures and geopolitical risks following the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec meeting in november 2016 oil prices have begun to recover indicating an uplift across the energy sector after a prolonged slump in the metals and mining sector there are emerging signs of optimism in the copper aluminum and lithium markets among others ma activity is also beginning to improve with high profile asset sales from shell total and bp among others in addition we have seen some large investments being made notably the glencore and qatar deal with rosneft and the separate gebaker hughes proposed transaction furthermore wood mackenzie expects final investment decisions in the oil and gas sector to significantly increase in 2017 albeit from recent lows however volatility in commodity prices means uncertainty for our customers which can impact their demand for our data and services notwithstanding the unsettled view of the us leadership towards the paris global accord on climate change over the longer term wood mackenzie expects a period of change in the energy mix the ongoing incentivizing of growth in renewable energy and other low carbon technologies around the world will help drive this while fossil fuels are expected to remain a core part of energy demand for the foreseeable future we will continue to evolve our offerings to meet the needs of our customers in an increasingly complex market 

market trends continue to influence our financial services vertical in important ways most notable among the recent trends affecting the vertical includes a significant increase in the number of alternative lenders and alternative payment instruments in the market we are adapting our offerings to address the needs of alternative lenders backed by our deep expertise and datasets covering the performance of customers across a full range of credit histories as well our unique ability to analyze the customer adoption rates of new alternative payment instruments from our syndicated study datasets is enabling us to serve as the “go to” solution for the industry’s analytic needs in the space a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the currencies of our international customers and a softening of the global economy is putting an even greater level of 

downward pressure on our revenues from such customers however we are also observing a growing appetite for our expensefocused solutions and regulatoryfocused solutions among those customers lastly we are seeing a greater number of companies entering the media effectiveness space which encourages potential competitors to challenge our position in this space we stand confident of our position at this stage given the unique nature and strength of our partnerships coupled by the comprehensiveness of our data particularly as it relates to seeing the full wallet spend of a consumer

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on 

other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and intangible assets pension and other post retirement benefits stock based compensation and income taxes actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company’s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered fees andor price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term usually one year revenues from transactionbased fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

the company also has termbased software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is postcontract customer support or pcs including unspecified upgrade rights on a whenandif available basis the company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term the pcs associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term the company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include pcs and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term in addition the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our customers on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 

we invoice our customers in annual quarterly or monthly installments amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenues on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met 

stockbased compensation 

the fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the use of several estimates including expected term expected riskfree interest rate expected volatility and expected dividend yield 

stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the fouryear vesting period we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1 2005 which requires that stockbased compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 

goodwill and intangibles 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets  this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value 

as of december 31 2016  we had goodwill and net intangible assets of 35889 million which represents 775 of our total assets during 2016  we performed an impairment test as of june 30 2016  and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing including an estimate of future expected revenues earnings and cash flows useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units to mitigate undue influence we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties the 

determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill there have been no goodwill impairment indicators subsequent to the impairment test performed as of june 30 2016  for the year ended december 31 2016  there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets 

pension and postretirement 

we account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  this standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive loss net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit credit cost 

certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit credit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize quoted rates from longterm bond indices and changes in longterm bond rates over the past year cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees as part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better at the measurement date the output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year’s discount rate and quoted rates for longterm bond indices for our pension plans at december 31 2016  we determined this rate to be 399  a decrease of 074 from the 473  rate used at december 31 2015  our postretirement rate is 325  at december 31 2016  and 2015  

the expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader longterm forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation and the current economic environment our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 4000  debt securities and 6000  equity securities as of december 31 2016  the pension plan assets were allocated 3780  debt 6160  equity securities and 060  other the veba plan target allocation is 100 debt we have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan the expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit credits costs we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 the future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under medicare part d was effectively changed this legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan we are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted 

a one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects 



income taxes 

in projecting future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of asc 740  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this interpretation we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 

we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

we estimate unrecognized tax positions of 08 million that may be recognized by december 31 2017 due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities net of additional uncertain tax positions 

as of december 31 2016  we have gross federal state and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of 1425 million which will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2036 such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows 



the net deferred income tax liability of 3066 million  consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2016  we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of 1000 million  which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1125  to 1625  depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax income and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instruments based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2016  a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 10 million based on our current borrowing levels 

foreign currency risk 

our foreignbased businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates a portion of our revenue is denominated in british pounds and other foreign currencies if the us dollar strengthens against british pounds and other foreign currencies our revenues reported in us dollars would decline with regard to operating expense our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in british pounds and other foreign currencies if british pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen costs reported in us dollars will increase movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  a hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings

our history 

we trace our history to 1971 when insurance services office inc or iso started operations as a notforprofit advisory and rating organization providing services for the us pc insurance industry iso was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators as required by law iso’s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development underwriting and rating functions today those businesses form the core of our risk assessment segment 

over the past two decades we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets through our decision analytics segment our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the american insurance services group or aisg and certain operations and assets of the national insurance crime bureau in 1997 and 1998 respectively those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud to further expand our decision analytics segment we acquired air worldwide or air in 2002 the technological leader in catastrophe modeling in 2004 we entered the healthcare space by acquiring several businesses that now offer webbased analytical and reporting systems for health insurers provider organizations and selfinsured employers in 2005 we entered the mortgage sector acquiring the first of several businesses that provided automated fraud detection compliance and decision support solutions for the us mortgage industry which we sold in march 2014 in 2006 to bolster our position in the insurance claims field we acquired xactware a leading supplier of estimating software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction in 2010 we acquired 3e company creating a scale presence in supply chain and environmental health and safety in 2011 and 2012 we further bolstered our healthcare solutions by acquiring health risk partners llc or hrp which provides solutions to optimize revenue improve compliance and improve quality of care for medicare advantage health plans and mediconnect global inc or mediconnect which provides medical record retrieval digitization coding extraction and analysis to the healthcare and property casualty industry also in 2012 we acquired argus information  advisory services llc or argus to expand our presence in providing information competitive benchmarking analytics and customized services to financial institutions in the payments space globally in 2014 we acquired maplecroftnet limited or maplecroft as part of our risk management and supply chain solutions business maplecroft continues to deliver thorough analyses of geopolitical societal human rights economic and environmental risks for many countries in the world in 2015 we acquired wood mackenzie limited or wood mackenzie to advance our strategy to expand internationally and position us in the global energy market 

these acquisitions have added scale geographic reach highly skilled workforces and a wide array of new capabilities to our decision analytics segment they have helped to make us a leading provider of information and decision analytics for customers involved in the business of risk in the us and selectively around the world 

on may 23 2008 in contemplation of our initial public offering or ipo iso formed verisk analytics inc or verisk a delaware corporation to be the holding company for our business verisk was initially formed as a whollyowned subsidiary of iso on october 6 2009 in connection with our ipo the company effected a reorganization whereby iso became a whollyowned subsidiary of verisk verisk common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on october 7 2009 under the symbol “vrsk” 

on october 1 2010 we completed a followon public offering we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering the primary purpose of the offering was to manage and organize the sale by class b insurance company shareholders while providing incremental public float concurrently with the closing of the offering we repurchased shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 1925 million directly from selling shareholders owning class b common stock we converted all class b shares to class a shares in 2011 and currently have no outstanding class b shares on may 26 2015 we eliminated the separate classes of common stock and as a result verisk class a and class b common stock were renamed common stock

we encounter competition from a number of sources including insurers who develop internal technology and actuarial methods for proprietary insurance programs competitors also include other statistical agents including the national independent statistical service the independent statistical service and other advisory organizations providing underwriting rules prospective loss costs and coverage language such as the american association of insurance services and mutual services organization although we believe none of our competitors has the breadth or depth of data we have 

competitors for our propertyspecific rating and underwriting information are primarily limited to a number of regional providers of commercial property inspections and surveys including overland solutions inc and regional reporting inc we also compete with a variety of organizations that offer consulting services primarily specialty technology and consulting firms in addition a customer may use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm for these services our competitors also include information technology product and services vendors management and strategy consulting firms including deloitte consulting llp and smaller specialized information technology firms and analytical services firms including pinnacle consulting and emb a unit of towers watson

when we find it advantageous we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings this approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows 

sales marketing and customer support 

we sell our products and services primarily through direct interaction with our clients we employ a threetier sales structure that includes salespeople product specialists and sales support as of december 31 2015  we had a sales force of 325 people within the company several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services these specialized sales teams sell specific highly technical product sets to targeted markets in coordination with account management 

to provide account management to our largest customers we segment the insurance carrier market into three groups tier one or “national” accounts constitutes our largest customers tier two or “strategic” accounts represents both larger carrier groups and middlemarket carriers tier three are the small insurance companies that may represent one line of business andor be onestate or regional writers a sales generalist is assigned to every insurer account and is responsible for our overall relationship with these insurance companies our senior executives are also involved with the senior management of our customers 

sales people participate in both customerservice and sales activities they provide direct support interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a positive experience using our services salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activity and provide the best solutions for our customers we believe our salespeople’s product knowledge and local presence differentiates us from our competition product specialists are subjectmatter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products both salespeople and product specialists have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities a team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination between the two groups 

sources of our data 

the data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions are sourced through seven different kinds of data arrangements first we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created upon their data these agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out and represent our primary method of data gathering it is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data second we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide to the data contributors their required levels of privacy protection of data and where necessary deidentification of data these agreements represent no cost to us and generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and require renewal third we “mine” data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions as an example we utilize the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models again these arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way fourth we source data generally at no cost from public sources including federal state and local governments fifth we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff that also perform property surveys at the request of and facilitated by property insurers sixth we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased including county tax assessor records descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses lastly we retrieve medical records from facilities and provider locations at prevailing market prices under agreements between our insurer customers and their provider networks in all our modes of data collection we are the owners of whatever derivative solutions we create using the data our costs for data received from our customers were 10 and 12 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively

intellectual property 

we own a significant number of intellectual property rights including copyrights trademarks trade secrets and patents specifically our policy language insurance manuals software and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue we also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the us and foreign countries including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines many of which are registered we believe many of our trademarks trade names service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them we consider our intellectual property to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of statutory eg copyright trademark trade secret and patent and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect them wherever they are used

in order to maintain control of our intellectual property we enter into license agreements with our customers granting each customer a license to use our products and services including our software and databases this helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions as a general practice employees contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights information and technology

regulation 

because our business involves the distribution of certain personal public and nonpublic data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility service and marketing decisions based on such data certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws in the united states and to a lesser extent foreign countries examples of such regulation include the fair credit reporting act which regulates the use of consumer credit report information the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of nonpublic personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions the health insurance portability and accountability act which restricts the public disclosure of patient information and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to healthcare businesses the drivers privacy protection act which prohibits the public disclosure use or resale by any state’s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record except for a “permissible purpose” and various other federal state and local laws and regulations 

these laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used to challenge the accuracy of such information andor to prevent the use and disclosure of such information in certain instances these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances 

we are also licensed as a rating rate service advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all fifty states puerto rico guam the virgin islands and the district of columbia as such an advisory organization we provide statistical actuarial policy language development and related products and services to propertycasualty insurers including advisory prospective loss costs other prospective cost information manual rules and policy language we also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policywriting and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators 

many of our products services and operations as well as insurer use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the mccarranferguson act as a result many of our operations and products are subject to review andor approval by state regulators furthermore our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes which are typically enforced by state attorneys general andor insurance regulators

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to invest in any of our securities if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer in such case the trading price of our securities including our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions 

we depend upon data from external sources including data received from customers and various government and public record services for information used in our databases in general we do not own the information in these databases and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons and we could also become subject to legislative judicial or contractual restrictions on the use of such data in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use andor process the data in addition some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company specifically a portion of common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers if our customers’ percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms if a substantial number of data sources or certain key sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

agreements with our data suppliers are shortterm agreements some suppliers are also competitors which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors an advantage such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from us pc primary insurers if there is a downturn in the us insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions our revenues will decline 

revenues derived from solutions we provide to us pc primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 44 of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to us pc primary insurers also invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the us pc insurance market which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control in addition our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions 

factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by pc primary insurers include the following 

 a downturn in the insurance industry pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

acquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions 

our longterm business strategy includes growth through acquisitions future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful acquirees any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses such risks include among other things 

 the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition 

we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities although we have capacity under committed facilities those may not be sufficient therefore future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and would result in dilution 

in addition to the extent we cannot identify or consummate on terms acceptable to us acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth 

there may be consolidation in our end customer market which would reduce the use of our services 

mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon for example in the pc insurance and healthcare services sector any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions our business could suffer serious harm 

our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions if we are unable to develop new solutions or if we are not successful in introducing andor obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate in addition significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in the past we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions primarily due to difficulties in developing models acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments errors or defects in our solutions that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection of our solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenues diversion of development resources an increase in product liability claims and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims 

we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them our business could be harmed 

our success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights to date we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and 

distribution to protect our proprietary technology this protection of our proprietary technology is limited and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent in addition patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products business we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage any disclosure loss invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and ultimately our business our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others including our competitors may use our proprietary technology without our consent furthermore litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face claims for intellectual property infringement which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers 

there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings particularly in the united states regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry there is a risk that we are infringing or may in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties we monitor thirdparty patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate however such monitoring and analysis has not been and is unlikely in the future to be comprehensive and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications since the patent application process can take several years to complete there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies as a result we may infringe existing and future thirdparty patents of which we are not aware as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 

thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions even if we prevail litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management’s time and attention 

if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop noninfringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

because personal public and nonpublic information is stored in some of our databases we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act grammleachbliley act driver’s privacy protection act health insurance portability and accountability act the european union’s data protection directive the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent various other federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace however many consumer advocates privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information particularly social security numbers department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth as a result they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation 

security breaches in our facilities computer networks and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems thirdparty contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of 

proprietary information if users gain improper access to our databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify confidential thirdparty information that is stored or transmitted on our networks 

in addition customers’ employees’ or other’s misuse of andor gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers any such misappropriation andor misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us among other things being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation 

a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways 

 incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed or any other security or privacy breaches may occur and could go undetected the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may lose key business assets including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links the internet or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 

our operations depend on our ability as well as that of thirdparty service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure fire flood power loss telecommunications failure impacts of terrorism breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers natural disasters or other disasters certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding earthquakes or other disasters the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers in addition we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time any damage to our data centers failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements resulting in decreased revenue operating income and earnings per share 

we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively 

some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive and are expected to remain highly competitive we compete on the basis of quality customer service product and service selection and price our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment due to their size certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can as a result these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences emerging technologies and market trends in addition new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away and as we enter into new lines of business due to acquisition or otherwise we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments especially against larger competitors we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete if we fail to successfully compete our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases the demand for some of our solutions may decrease 

public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 

our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of almost 15  years 

however we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team if we lose key members of our senior management operating team we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers 

our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees if our attrition rate increases our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work 

if our business continues to grow the number of people we will need to hire will increase we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs 

we are subject to antitrust consumer protection and other litigation and may in the future become subject to further such litigation an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

we participate in businesses particularly insurancerelated businesses and services that are subject to substantial litigation including antitrust and consumer protection litigation in addition our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability given the nature of our business we may be subject to similar litigation in the future even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth 

general economic political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business 

the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation the united states economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial 

condition a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions 

if there are substantial sales of our common stock our stock price could decline 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive as of december 31 2015  our ten largest shareholders owned 383 of our common stock including 57 of our common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration and subject to limitations on the timing amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly in addition the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

pursuant to our equity incentive plans options to purchase approximately 9057243 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 19 2016  we filed a registration statement under the securities act which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans including for such outstanding options as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

also in the future we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 

our capital structure level of indebtedness and the terms of antitakeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us as a public company we are subject to section 203 which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 150 or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions but we do not intend to do so 

these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 

we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of wood mackenzie 

on may 19 2015 we consummated the acquisition of wood mackenzie the “acquisition” in order to finance the acquisition we incurred 21800 million of indebtedness as of december 31 2015 we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately 31680 million  and our leverage ratio debt to ebitda increased from 157x at march 31 2015 to 289x our increased leverage resulting from the acquisition could adversely affect our business in particular it could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities the increased leverage potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition 

we may fail to realize all the expected benefits of the acquisition or successfully integrate wood mackenzie’s operations or preserve its customers and employees in an efficient or timely manner the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration this integration effort may also distract our management’s focus from our existing core businesses or impair our existing relationships with employees customers and our strategic partners we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or longterm strategic benefits of the acquisition or could incur higher transition costs an inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition as well as any delays encountered in the integration process or an inability to integrate the operations of the two companies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

general economic uncertainties including downward trends in the energy industry could reduce demand by wood mackenzie’s customers for its products and services 

demand for wood mackenzie’s products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties particularly any downward trends in the energy industry many factors could negatively affect the revenues profits and discretionary spending of wood mackenzie’s customers such factors include commodity prices in particular oil and coal the state of the local economy interest rates currency exchange rates political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations the availability of industry resources and other matters a downturn or perceived downturn in the economy particularly the energy industry could add pricing pressure delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by wood mackenzie’s customers which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations 

wood mackenzie is based in the united kingdom and conducts its principal operations outside the united states as a result the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the united states has increased materially conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws legal standards regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers unexpected changes in regulatory requirements taxes trade laws tariffs export quotas custom duties or other trade restrictions differing technology standards difficulties in collecting accounts receivable difficulties in managing and staffing international operations varying expectations as to employee standards potentially adverse tax consequences including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries moreover international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war and other economic or political uncertainties all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations 

the revenues and costs of wood mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling as a result of the acquisition we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies as exchange rates vary revenue cost of revenue operating expenses and other operating results when remeasured in us dollars may differ materially from expectations although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own such as ongoing management time and expertise external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications

executive summary 

key performance metrics 

we believe our business’s ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy we use year over year revenue growth and ebitda margin as metrics to measure our performance ebitda and ebitda margin are nongaap financial measures see note 3 within item 6 selected financial data section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

revenue growth  we use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers sales to new customers sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses 

ebitda margin  we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth 

revenues 

we earn revenues through subscriptions longterm agreements and on a transactional basis subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year as a result the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period in general we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business our longterm agreements are generally for periods of three to five years we recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most longterm agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 

certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis for example we have solutions that allow our customers to obtain propertyspecific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building or compare a pc insurance medical or workers’ compensation claim with information in our databases for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  253 and 277 of our revenues respectively were derived from providing transactional solutions we earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed in general transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month 

approximately 901 and 896 of the revenues in our risk assessment segment for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions our customers in this segment include most of the pc insurance providers in the united states approximately 670  and 619 of the revenues in our decision analytics segment for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions in this segment customer bases are within the insurance financial services energy and specialized markets and healthcare verticals 

principal operating costs and expenses 

personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses which represented 571 and 568 of our total expenses for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively include salaries benefits incentive compensation equity compensation costs sales commissions employment taxes recruiting costs and outsourced temporary agency costs 

we allocate personnel expenses between two categories cost of revenues and selling general and administrative costs based on the actual costs associated with each employee we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues and all other personnel including executive managers sales people marketing business development finance legal human resources and administrative services as selling general and administrative expenses a significant portion of our other operating costs such as facilities and communications are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed 

while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues historically our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses however part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions which may offset margin expansion 

cost of revenues  our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our nextgeneration solutions our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization 

selling general and administrative expense  our selling general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities insurance and communications are also allocated to selling general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee our selling general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization 

trends affecting our business 

we serve customers in four primary vertical markets propertycasualty insurance healthcare energy and financial services the industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business 

 a significant change in propertycasualty insurers’ profitability could positively or negatively affect demand for our solutions for insurers the keys to profitability include investment income and premium growth investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates growth in propertycasualty insurers’ direct written premiums is cyclical with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 148 in 2002 to a trough of negative 31 in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 44 in 2012 43 in 2013 and 44 in 2014 based on our experience insurers more closely scrutinize their spending in periods of more challenging growth in recent years we have signed multiyear contracts with certain customers and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multiyear period pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years premiums 

trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers’ profitability and therefore their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks the apparent increase in the frequency and severity of weather events that cause losses for insurers could lead to increased demand for our catastrophe modeling catastrophe loss information and repair cost solutions a significant decrease in the number or severity of catastrophes could negatively affect our revenues we also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity the need by our customers to fight insurance fraud — both in claims and at policy inception — could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions 

market trends continue to influence our financial services vertical in important ways most notable among the recent trends affecting the vertical includes a significant increase in the number of alternative lenders and alternative payment instruments in the market we are adapting our offerings to address the needs of alternative lenders backed by our deep expertise in and datasets covering the performance of customers across a full range of credit histories as well our unique ability to analyze the customer adoption rates of new alternative payment instruments from our syndicated study datasets is enabling us to serve as the “go to” solution for the industry’s analytic needs in the space a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the currencies of our international clients and a softening of the global economy is putting an even greater level of downward pressure on our revenues from such clients however we are also observing a growing appetite for our expense and regulatory focused solutions among those clients lastly we are seeing a greater number of companies entering the ad effectiveness space potential competitors to our position in this space we stand confident of our position at this stage given the unique nature and strength of our partnerships coupled by the comprehensiveness of our data particularly as it relates to seeing the full wallet spend of a consumer 

trends in the energy metals and mining sectors and activity in financial markets can influence our revenues movements of commodity prices affect the profitability of energy and metals and mining companies while stock markets and mergers and acquisitions or ma are the principal drivers of activity for financial institutions among the specific trends influencing commodity prices are global gross domestic product growth supply of individual commodities and geopolitical factors the slow down of the chinese economy is currently contributing to an oversupply of a number of commodities rising us oil and gas production opec policy and the partial lifting of sanctions against iran in january 2016 has led to a sharp fall in crude oil prices and most metals markets are currently in oversupply lower commodity prices have reduced discretionary spending for clients and has stalled ma activity however the uncertainty also increases client demand for our data and services commodity prices are expected to recover over time to incentivize the investment required to meet growing energy demand longer term the paris global accord on climate change signals a period of change in the energy mix incentivizing growth in renewable energy and other low carbon technologies while fossil fuels are expected to remain a core part of energy demand for the foreseeable future we will continue to evolve our offerings to meet the needs of our clients in an increasingly complex market 

trends in the us healthcare market can affect a portion of our revenues in the decision analytics segment that market continues to undergo significant change as the result of healthcare reform legislation the specific trends affecting our current healthcare business include payment reform expansion of insurance coverage and efforts at cost containment payment reform is driving the market to valuebased reimbursement which has caused healthcare providers to bear increased financial risk and responsibility for quality outcomes the expansion of insurance coverage has reduced the uninsured population through both 

increased enrollment in medicaid and in the commercial market through statewide health exchanges as the government seeks to control fraud waste and abuse efforts to contain costs will likely continue to become more prevalent although such changes have the potential to disrupt the healthcare marketplace we believe the requirements for reform could increase demand for our analytic solutions in the areas of population health management quality measurement risk adjustment for medicare advantage and qualified health plans participating on statewide health exchanges and detection of prepayment fraud waste and abuse we experience seasonality in our medicare advantage risk adjustment business in the second half of our fiscal year related to the cms submission deadline

our revenue by category for the periods presented is set forth below for the years ended december 31 



cost of revenues 

cost of revenues for our risk assessment segment was 2082 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 1945 million for the year ended december 31 2013 an increase of 137 million or 70 the increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits costs of 98 million which includes severance costs of 48 million that occurred in the fourth quarter in 2014 other increases were related to information technology expenses of 26 million rent expense of 10 million and data and consulting costs of 08 million these increases were offset by a decrease in other general expenses of 05 million 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses for our risk assessment segment were 738 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 774 million for the year ended december 31 2013 a decrease of 36 million or 46 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of 30 million a decrease in travel cost of 04 million and other general expenses of 11 million these decreases were offset by an increase in information technology of 08 million and professional consulting fees of 01 million 

ebitda margin 

the ebitda margin for our risk assessment segment was 567 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 561 for the year ended december 31 2013 the increase in margin is primarily attributed to operating leverage in the segment as well as cost efficiencies 

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2015  in management’s opinion the quarterly data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and reflects all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of this data the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period 



liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had cash and cash equivalents and availableforsale securities of 1419 million and 432 million respectively subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year we have historically generated significant cash flows from operations as a result of this factor as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and to fuel our future growth plans 

we have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that as described above we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or longterm contracts which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered when cash is received for prepayment of invoices we record an asset cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability deferred revenues this current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services in most businesses growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows unlike these businesses our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services 

our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  were 80  and 84 respectively we estimate our capital expenditures for 2016  will be approximately 175 million which primarily consists of expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with asc 35040 “ accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use ” we also capitalize amounts in accordance with asc 98520 “ software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed ” 

we have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  we repurchased 205 million 7785 million and 2774 million respectively of our common stock

net cash provided by operating activities increased to 6237 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 4895 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers driven by an increase in revenues and operating profit and additional operating cash flow from wood mackenzie partially offset by acquisition fees related to the acquisition of wood mackenzie and interest payments on our senior notes that were issued in may 2015 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 4895 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 5069 million for the year ended december 31 2013 net cash provided by operating activities was primarily affected by the sale of our mortgage services business and the timing of excess tax benefits from exercised stock options in the first quarter of 2013

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and intangible assets pension and other post retirement benefits stock based compensation and income taxes actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company’s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered fees andor price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term usually one year revenues from transactionbased fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

the company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is postcontract customer support or pcs including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis the company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term the pcs associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term the company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include pcs and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term in addition the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 

we invoice our customers in annual quarterly or monthly installments amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenues on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met 

stock based compensation 

the fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the use of several estimates including expected term expected riskfree interest rate expected volatility and expected dividend yield 

stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the fouryear vesting period we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1 2005 which requires that stock based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 

goodwill and intangibles 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized intangible 

assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets  this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value 

as of december 31 2015  we had goodwill and net intangible assets of 45116 million which represents 803 of our total assets during 2015  we performed an impairment test as of june 30 2015  and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing including an estimate of future expected revenues earnings and cash flows useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units to mitigate undue influence we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill as part of this regular process the company conducted the annual impairment test of our newly acquired energy reporting unit at june 30 2015 at which time the fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 5 this outcome is consistent with the company’s expectation due to the proximity of the impairment test date of june 30 to the acquisition date of may 19 2015 our valuation has not indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of 31348 million as of december 31 2015  for the year ended december 31 2015  there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets 

there was a significant estimate this year related to the acquisition of wood mackenzie the preliminarily estimated fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the purchase of wood mackenzie have been recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on known facts that existed on the date of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the preliminary fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets was recorded as goodwill we determined the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities of wood mackenzie with the assistance of valuations performed by third party specialists discounted cash flow analysis and estimates made by management these estimates and assumptions are subject to change during the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date and may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements see note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further information 

pension and postretirement 

on february 29 2012 we instituted a hard freeze which eliminates all future compensation and service credits to all participants in the pension plans see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  this standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income loss net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit credit cost 

certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit credit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize quoted rates from longterm bond indices and changes in longterm bond rates over the past year cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees as part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better at the measurement date the output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year’s discount rate and quoted rates for longterm bond indices for our pension plans at december 31 2015  we determined this rate to be 473  an increase of 074 from the 399  rate used at december 31 2014  our postretirement rate is 325  at december 31 2015  an increase of 025 from the 300  used at december 31 2014  

the expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader longterm forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation and the current economic environment our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 4000  debt securities and 

6000  equity securities as of december 31 2015  the pension plan assets were allocated 3960  debt 6000  equity securities and 040  other the veba plan target allocation is 100 debt we have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan the expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit credits costs we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 the future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under medicare part d was effectively changed this legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan we are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted 

a one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects 



income taxes 

in projecting future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of asc 740  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this interpretation we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 

we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

we estimate unrecognized tax positions of 05 million that may be recognized by december 31 2016 due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities net of additional uncertain tax positions 

as of december 31 2015  we have gross federal state and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of 566   million which will expire at various dates from 2016 through 2035 such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows 



the net deferred income tax liability of 3964 million  consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2015  we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of 8700 million  which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1125  to 1625  depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax income and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instruments based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2015  a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 87 million based on our current borrowing levels 

foreign currency risk 

our foreignbased businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates a portion of our revenue is denominated in british pounds and other foreign currencies if the us dollar strengthens against british pounds and other foreign currencies our revenues reported in us dollars would decline with regard to operating expense our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in british pounds and other foreign currencies if british pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen costs reported in us dollars will increase movements in the us dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  a hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the us dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings

 we add value by linking our solutions across these four key processes for example we use the same modeling methods to support the pricing of homeowner’s insurance policies and to quantify the actual losses when damage occurs to insured homes 

we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or longterm agreements which are typically prepaid and represented approximately 723 of our revenues in 2014  for the year ended december 31 2014  we had revenues of 17467 million  and net income of 4000 million  for the five year period ended december 31 2014  our revenues and net income grew at a compound annual growth rate or cagr of 152   and 133 respectively 

as further described below results of operations for the mortgage services business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended december 31 2014  and for all prior periods presented as necessary the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations 

our history 

we trace our history to 1971 when insurance services office inc or iso started operations as a notforprofit advisory and rating organization providing services for the us pc insurance industry iso was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators as required by law iso’s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development underwriting and rating functions today those businesses form the core of our risk assessment segment 

over the past decade we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets through our decision analytics segment our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the american insurance services group or aisg and certain operations and assets of the national insurance crime bureau in 1997 and 1998 respectively those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud to further expand our decision analytics segment we acquired air worldwide or air in 2002 the technological leader in catastrophe modeling in 2004 we entered the healthcare space by acquiring several businesses that now offer webbased analytical and reporting systems for health insurers provider organizations and selfinsured employers in 2005 we entered the mortgage sector acquiring the first of several businesses that provided automated fraud detection compliance and decision support solutions for the us mortgage industry which we sold in march 2014 in 2006 to bolster our position in the insurance claims field we acquired xactware a leading supplier of estimating software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction in 2010 we acquired 3e company creating a scale presence in supply chain and environmental health and safety in 2011 and 2012 we further bolstered our healthcare solutions by acquiring health risk partners llc or hrp which provides solutions to optimize revenue improve compliance and improve quality of care for medicare advantage health plans and mediconnect global inc or mediconnect which provides medical record retrieval digitization coding extraction and analysis to the healthcare and property casualty industry also in 2012 we acquired argus information  advisory services llc or argus to expand our presence in providing information competitive benchmarking analytics and customized services to financial institutions in the payments space globally in 2014 we acquired maplecroftnet limited or maplecroft as part of our risk management and supply chain solutions business maplecroft will continue to deliver thorough analyses of geopolitical societal human rights economic and environmental risks for many countries in the world 

these acquisitions have added scale geographic reach highly skilled workforces and a wide array of new capabilities to our decision analytics segment they have helped to make us a leading provider of information and decision analytics for customers involved in the business of risk in the us and selectively around the world 

on may 23 2008 in contemplation of our initial public offering or ipo iso formed verisk analytics inc or verisk a delaware corporation to be the holding company for our business verisk was initially formed as a whollyowned subsidiary of iso on october 6 2009 in connection with our ipo the company effected a reorganization whereby iso became a whollyowned subsidiary of verisk verisk class a common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on october 7 2009 under the symbol “vrsk” 

on march 11 2014 we sold our mortgage services business interthinx inc or interthinx from 2009 to 2011 the mortgage services business was in both risk assessment segment within the insurance services revenue category and decision analytics segment in the financial services revenue category in 2012 we reclassified the appraisal mortgage tools from risk assessment to our decision analytics segment in the financial services revenue category therefore in 2012 and 2013 the mortgage services business is within decision analytics segment results of operations for the mortgage services business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended december 31 2014  and for all prior periods presented as necessary the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations 

our senior management team which includes our president and chief executive officer chief financial officer general counsel and six senior officers who lead our business and operational units have been with us for an average of almost 18  years this team has led our transformation to a successful forprofit entity focused on growth with our us pc insurer customers and expansion into a variety of new vertical markets including healthcare financial services and supply chain 

segments 

we organize our business in two segments risk assessment and decision analytics see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii of this annual report for additional information regarding our segments 

risk assessment segment 

our risk assessment segment serves our pc insurance customers and focuses on the first two decision making processes in our risk analysis framework prediction of loss and selection and pricing of risk within this segment we also provide solutions to help our insurance customers comply with their reporting requirements in each us state in which they operate our customers include most of the pc insurance providers in the us 

industrystandard insurance programs 

we are the recognized leader in the us for industrystandard insurance programs that help pc insurers define coverages and issue policies our policy language prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language rules and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements insurers must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law to meet their needs we process and interface with state regulators in all 50 states plus the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands approximately 3000 regulatory filings each year ensuring smooth implementation of our rules and forms when insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs our industrystandard insurance programs also help regulators make sure that such insurers’ policies meet basic coverage requirements 

standardized coverage language which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants as a result our industrystandard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known our policy language includes standard coverage language endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they are offering with these policy programs insurers also benefit from economies of scale we have over 120 specialized lawyers and insurance experts reviewing changes in each state’s insurance rules and regulations including on average over 11000 legislative bills 1400 regulatory actions and 2000 court cases per year to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information 

to cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace we offer a broad range of policy programs for example in the homeowner’s line of insurance we maintain policy language and rules for 6 basic coverages 248 national endorsements and 593 statespecific endorsements overall we provide policy language prospective loss costs policy writing rules and a variety of other solutions for 26 lines of insurance 

the pc insurance industry is heavily regulated in the us pc insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate our statistical agent services have enabled pc insurers to meet these regulatory requirements for over 40 years we aggregate the data and as a licensed or appointed “statistical agent” in all 50 states puerto rico and the district of columbia we report these statistics to insurance regulators we are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the us pc insurance industry 

to provide our customers and the regulators the information they require we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world over the past four decades we have developed core expertise in acquiring processing managing and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our risk assessment segment we use our proprietary technology to assemble organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers we supplement this data with publicly available information 

each year pc insurers send us approximately 30 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred we maintain a database of over 179 billion statistical records including approximately 71 billion commercial lines records and approximately 108 billion personal lines records we collect unittransaction detail of each premium and loss record which enhances the validity reliability and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial analyses our proprietary quality process includes over 2500 separate checks to ensure that data meet our high standards of quality

we project future losses and loss expenses utilizing a broad set of data these projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used solely their own data we make a number of actuarial adjustments before the data is used to estimate future costs our customers can use our estimates of future costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies for most pc insurers in most lines of business we believe our estimates of future costs are an essential input to rating decisions our actuarial products and services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industrystandard insurance programs described above 

propertyspecific rating and underwriting information 

we gather information on individual properties and communities so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price personal and commercial property insurance as well as commercial liability insurance our propertyspecific rating and underwriting information allow our customers to understand quantify underwrite mitigate and avoid potential loss for commercial properties our database contains loss costs and other vital information on more than 35 million commercial buildings in the united states and also holds information on more than 62 million individual businesses occupying those buildings we have a staff of more than 600 field representatives strategically located around the united states who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties evaluate community fireprotection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal buildingcode enforcement each year our field staff visits over 325000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes

decision analytics segment 

in the decision analytics segment we support all four phases of our risk analysis framework we develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better predict loss select and price risk detect fraud before and after a loss event and quantify losses the businesses are categorized by the primary end market for their services

insurance 

we are a leading provider of frauddetection tools for the pc insurance industry our fraud solutions improve our customers’ profitability by both predicting the likelihood that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred when a claim is submitted our system searches our database and returns information about other claims filed by the same individuals or businesses either as claimants or insurers which helps our customers determine if fraud has occurred the system searches for matches in identifying information fields such as name address social security number vehicle identification number driver’s license number tax identification number or other parties to the loss our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches information from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim negotiation of a reduced award or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement 

we have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and investigations professionals to process claims and fight fraud claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against insurance fraud the benefits of a single allclaims database include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for information enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious claims and superior information for investigating fraudulent claims suspicious individuals and possible fraud rings our database contains information on approximately 994 million claims and is the world’s largest database of pc claims information used for claims and investigations insurers and other participants submit new claims more than 199000 a day on average across all categories of the us pc insurance industry

sales people participate in both customerservice and sales activities they provide direct support interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a positive experience using our services salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activity and provide the best solutions for our customers we believe our salespeople’s product knowledge and local presence differentiates us from our competition product specialists are subjectmatter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products both salespeople and product specialists have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities a team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination between the two groups

we are also licensed as a rating rate service advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all fifty states puerto rico guam the virgin islands and the district of columbia as such an advisory organization we provide statistical actuarial policy language development and related products and services to propertycasualty insurers including advisory prospective loss costs other prospective cost information manual rules and policy language we also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policywriting and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators 

many of our products services and operations as well as insurer use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the mccarranferguson act as a result many of our operations and products are subject to review andor approval by state regulators furthermore our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes which are typically enforced by state attorneys general andor insurance regulators

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to invest in any of our securities if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer in such case the trading price of our securities including our class a common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions 

we depend upon data from external sources including data received from customers and various government and public record services for information used in our databases in general we do not own the information in these databases and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons and we could also become subject to legislative judicial or contractual restrictions on the use of such data in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use andor process the data in addition some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company specifically a portion of class a common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers if our customers’ percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms if a substantial number of data sources or certain key sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

agreements with our data suppliers are shortterm agreements some suppliers are also competitors which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors an advantage such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from us pc primary insurers if there is a downturn in the us insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions our revenues will decline 

revenues derived from solutions we provide to us pc primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2014  approximately 491 of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to us pc primary insurers also invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the us pc insurance market which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control in addition our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions 

factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by pc primary insurers include the following 

 a downturn in the insurance industry pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

acquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions 

our longterm business strategy includes growth through acquisitions future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful acquirees any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses such risks include among other things 

 the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition 

we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities although we have capacity under committed facilities those may not be sufficient therefore future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and would result in dilution 

in addition to the extent we cannot identify or consummate on terms acceptable to us acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth 

there may be consolidation in our end customer market which would reduce the use of our services 

mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon for example in the pc insurance and healthcare services sector any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions our business could suffer serious harm 

our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions if we are unable to develop new solutions or if we are not successful in introducing andor obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate in addition significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in the past we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions primarily due to difficulties in developing models acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments errors or defects in our solutions that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection of our solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenues diversion of development resources an increase in product liability claims and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims 

we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them our business could be harmed 

our success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights to date we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and 

distribution to protect our proprietary technology this protection of our proprietary technology is limited and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent in addition patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products business we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage any disclosure loss invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and ultimately our business our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others including our competitors may use our proprietary technology without our consent furthermore litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face claims for intellectual property infringement which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers 

there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings particularly in the united states regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry there is a risk that we are infringing or may in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties we monitor thirdparty patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate however such monitoring and analysis has not been and is unlikely in the future to be comprehensive and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications since the patent application process can take several years to complete there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies as a result we may infringe existing and future thirdparty patents of which we are not aware as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 

thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions even if we prevail litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management’s time and attention 

if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop noninfringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

because personal public and nonpublic information is stored in some of our databases we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act grammleachbliley act driver’s privacy protection act health insurance portability and accountability act the european union’s data protection directive the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent various other federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace however many consumer advocates privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information particularly social security numbers department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth as a result they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation 

security breaches in our facilities computer networks and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems thirdparty contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of 

proprietary information if users gain improper access to our databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify confidential thirdparty information that is stored or transmitted on our networks 

in addition customers’ employees’ or other’s misuse of andor gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers any such misappropriation andor misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us among other things being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation 

a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways 

 incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed or any other security or privacy breaches may occur and could go undetected the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may lose key business assets including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links the internet or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 

our operations depend on our ability as well as that of thirdparty service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure fire flood power loss telecommunications failure impacts of terrorism breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers natural disasters or other disasters certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding earthquakes or other disasters the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers in addition we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time any damage to our data centers failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements resulting in decreased revenue operating income and earnings per share 

we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively 

some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive and are expected to remain highly competitive we compete on the basis of quality customer service product and service selection and price our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment due to their size certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can as a result these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences emerging technologies and market trends in addition new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away and as we enter into new lines of business due to acquisition or otherwise we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments especially against larger competitors we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete if we fail to successfully compete our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases the demand for some of our solutions may decrease 

public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 

our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of almost 18  years 

however we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team if we lose key members of our senior management operating team we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers 

our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees if our attrition rate increases our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work 

if our business continues to grow the number of people we will need to hire will increase we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs 

we are subject to antitrust consumer protection and other litigation and may in the future become subject to further such litigation an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

we participate in businesses particularly insurancerelated businesses and services that are subject to substantial litigation including antitrust and consumer protection litigation in addition our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability given the nature of our business we may be subject to similar litigation in the future even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth 

general economic political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business 

the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation the united states economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial 

condition a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions 

if there are substantial sales of our common stock our stock price could decline 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive as of december 31 2014  our ten largest shareholders owned 487 of our class a common stock including 74 of our class a common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration and subject to limitations on the timing amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly in addition the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

pursuant to our equity incentive plans options to purchase approximately 8986583 shares of class a common stock were outstanding as of february 20 2015  we filed a registration statement under the securities act which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans including for such outstanding options as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

also in the future we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 

our capital structure level of indebtedness and the terms of antitakeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us as a public company we are subject to section 203 which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 150 or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions but we do not intend to do so 

these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future

we organize our business in two segments risk assessment and decision analytics our risk assessment segment provides statistical actuarial and underwriting data for the us pc insurance industry our risk assessment segment revenues represented approximately 372 and 387 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively effective december 31 2012 we combined the statistical agency and data services and actuarial services into industrystandard insurance programs within our risk assessment segment our decision analytics segment provides solutions our customers use to analyze the processes of the verisk risk analysis framework prediction of loss detection and prevention of fraud and 

quantification of loss our decision analytics segment revenues represented approximately 628 and 613 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively 

in january 2014 we entered into an agreement to acquire 100 of the stock of eagleview technology corporation or evt the parent company of pictometry international corp and eagle view technologies inc for a net cash purchase price of 650 million which would have been funded by the companys operating cash and borrowings from our credit facility evt is a provider of georeferenced aerial image capture and visualcentric data analytics and solutions to insurers contractors government and commercial customers in the united states on december 16 2014 we ended our efforts to acquire evt following the vote by the federal trade commission or ftc to challenge the transaction

executive summary 

key performance metrics 

we believe our business’s ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy we use year over year revenue growth and ebitda margin as metrics to measure our performance ebitda and ebitda margin are nongaap financial measures see note 3 within item 6 selected financial data section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

revenue growth  we use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers sales to new customers sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses 

ebitda margin  we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth 

revenues 

we earn revenues through subscriptions longterm agreements and on a transactional basis subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year as a result the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period in general we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business our longterm agreements are generally for periods of three to five years we recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most longterm agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 

certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis for example we have solutions that allow our customers to obtain propertyspecific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building or compare a pc insurance medical or workers’ compensation claim with information in our databases for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  277 and 264 of our revenues respectively were derived from providing transactional solutions we earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed in general transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month 

approximately 896 and 882 of the revenues in our risk assessment segment for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions our customers in this segment include most of the pc insurance providers in the united states approximately 619  and 644 of the revenues in our decision analytics segment for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions in this segment customer bases are within the insurance healthcare financial services and specialized markets verticals 

principal operating costs and expenses 

personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses which represented 568 and 597 of our total expenses for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively include salaries benefits incentive compensation equity compensation costs sales commissions employment taxes recruiting costs and outsourced temporary agency costs 

we allocate personnel expenses between two categories cost of revenues and selling general and administrative costs based on the actual costs associated with each employee we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues and all other personnel including executive managers sales people marketing business development finance legal human resources and administrative services as selling general and administrative expenses a significant portion of our other operating costs such as facilities and communications are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed 

while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues historically our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses however part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions which may offset margin expansion 

cost of revenues  our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our nextgeneration solutions our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization 

selling general and administrative expense  our selling general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities insurance and communications are also allocated to selling general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee our selling general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization 

trends affecting our business 

we serve customers in three primary vertical markets propertycasualty insurance healthcare and financial services the industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business 

 a significant change in propertycasualty insurers’ profitability could positively or negatively affect demand for our solutions for insurers the keys to profitability include investment income and premium growth investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates growth in propertycasualty insurers’ direct written premiums is cyclical with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 148 in 2002 to a trough of negative 31 in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 44 in 2012 and then receding to 43 in 2013 and 38 through ninemonths 2014 based on our experience insurers more closely scrutinize their spending in periods of more challenging growth in recent years we have signed multiyear contracts with certain customers and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multiyear period pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years premiums 

trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers’ profitability and therefore their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks the apparent increase in the frequency and severity of weather events that cause losses for insurers could lead to increased demand for our catastrophe modeling catastrophe loss information and repair cost solutions a significant decrease in the number or severity of catastrophes could negatively affect our revenues we also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity the need by our customers to fight insurance fraud — both in claims and at policy inception — could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions 

trends in the us healthcare market can affect a portion of our revenues in the decision analytics segment that market is undergoing significant change as the result of healthcare reform legislation the specific trends we see affecting our current healthcare business include payment reform expansion of insurance coverage and efforts at cost containment payment reform will likely drive the market to valuebased reimbursement and require healthcare providers to bear increased financial risk and responsibility for quality outcomes the expansion of insurance eligibility will increase medicaid rolls and promote participation in statewide health exchanges and as the government seeks to control fraud waste and abuse efforts to contain costs will likely become more prevalent although such changes have the potential to disrupt the healthcare marketplace we believe the requirements for reform could increase demand for our analytic solutions in the areas of population management quality measurement providerpayer risk sharing and valuebased payment management medicare advantage revenue management and compliance risk adjustment and detection of prepayment fraud and abuse we experience seasonality in our medicare advantage business tied to third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year related to cms deadlines 

us and global market trends can influence the revenue composition and growth trajectory of our financial services vertical recent focus of global regulators on baseliii compliance and us regulators on compliance to recently adopted 2009 doddfrank laws on antimoney laundering stress testing and capital adequacy have led to a significant shift of our datahosting solution toward the meeting of those specific needs of our bank clients we expect that a rising interest rate environment is likely to put a significant margin pressure on our bank clients and can resultantly impact their marketing budgets for growth however a strengthening american economy is likely to spur increased lending and could likely offset some of that budgetary risk trends associated with the strengthening us dollar relative to several other international currencies uk canadian australian and new zealand is putting a downward pressure on our revenues from bank clients from overseas markets lastly a longer term shift of advertising spend from tv and radio toward digital media has resulted in a greater opportunity for our partnerships and media effectiveness line of businesses

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2014  in management’s opinion the quarterly data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and reflects all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of this data the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period 



liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had cash and cash equivalents and availableforsale securities of 432 million and 1697 million respectively subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year we have historically generated significant cash flows from operations as a result of this factor as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and to fuel our future growth plans 

we have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that as described above we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or longterm contracts which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered when cash is received for prepayment of invoices we record an asset cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability fees received in advance this current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services in most businesses growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows unlike these businesses our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services 

our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  were 84  and 91 respectively we estimate our capital expenditures for 2015  will be approximately 1500 million which primarily include expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with asc 35040 “ accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use ” we also capitalize amounts in accordance with asc 98520 “ software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed ” 

we have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  we repurchased 6754 million exclusive of 1000 million of unsettled purchase price associated with the asr program see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 2789 million and 1626 million respectively of our common stock 

in prior years we provided pension and postretirement benefits to certain qualifying active employees and retirees on february 29 2012 we instituted a hard freeze which eliminated all future compensation and service credits to all participants in the pension plans in april 2012 we completed a voluntary prefunding to our qualified pension plan of 720 million which resulted in a contribution of 788 million for the year of which 282 million was the minimum contribution requirement for 2012 as a result of the prefunding we do not expect to make any contribution in 2015  with respect to our qualified pension plan under the postretirement plan we provided certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying participants however participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the premium coverage we expect to contribute approximately 11 million to the postretirement plan in 2015  see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

financing and financing capacity 

we had total debt excluding capital lease obligations of 14258 million and 12651 million at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the debt at december 31 2014  was primarily issued under senior notes and longterm private placement loan facilities to finance our stock repurchases and acquisitions 

on april 6 2011 we completed an issuance of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of 4500 million these senior notes are due on may 1 2021 and accrue interest at a rate of 5800 per annum interest is payable semiannually on may 1st and november 1st of each year 

on december 8 2011 we completed a second issuance of senior notes in the aggregate principal of 2500 million these senior notes are due on january 15 2019 and accrue interest at a rate of 4875 per annum interest is payable semiannually on january 15th and july 15th of each year 

on september 12 2012 we completed a third issuance of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of 3500 million these senior notes are due on september 12 2022 and accrue interest at a rate of 4125 per annum interest is payable semiannually on march 12th and september 12th of each year 

the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by iso and certain subsidiaries that guarantee our syndicated revolving credit facility credit facility or any amendment refinancing or replacement thereof we expect to redraw from our credit facility over time as needed for our corporate strategy 

including for general corporate purposes share repurchases and acquisitions the indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things create certain liens enter into saleleaseback transactions and consolidate with sell lease convey or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets or merge with or into any other person or entity 

on october 21 2014 we amended our committed senior unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks to increase the borrowing capacity under the credit facility from 9750 million to 9900 million and extend the maturity date from october 2018 to october 2019 we amortize all onetime fees and third party costs associated with the execution and amendment of this credit facility through the maturity date interest is payable at a maturity rate of libor plus 1125 to 1625 depending on the result of certain ratios defined in the credit agreement verisk and iso are coborrowers under the credit facility borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital and capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchase programs during the year ended december 31 2014   we borrowed 2250 million under the credit facility and repaid 650 million as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had 1600 million and 0  outstanding borrowings under the credit facility respectively in january and february 2015 we repaid a total of 1400 million of the 1600 million outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 

  as of december 31 2014  we have an available borrowing capacity net of outstanding letters of credit of 8278 million under the credit facility 

the credit facility contains certain customary financial and other covenants that among other things impose certain restrictions on indebtedness liens investments and capital expenditures these covenants also place restrictions on mergers asset sales saleleaseback transactions payments between us and our subsidiaries and certain transactions with affiliates the financial covenants require that at the end of any fiscal quarter we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 30 to 10 and that during any period of four fiscal quarters we maintain a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio below 35 to 10 we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the credit facility as of december 31 2014 

we also had longterm private placement loan facilities under uncommitted master shelf agreements with new york life and prudential capital group that expired during 2013 we did not extend these agreements as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had 2200 million outstanding under these facilities for both periods the weighted average rate of interest with respect to our outstanding borrowings under these facilities was 636 for each of the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  and amounts outstanding was 19 million at the end of each period these notes contain certain covenants that limit our ability to create liens enter into saleleaseback transactions and consolidate merge or sell assets to another company these notes also contain financial covenants that require that at the end of any fiscal quarter we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 30 to 10 and that we maintain a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio below 30 to 10 at the end of any fiscal quarter we were in compliance with all debt covenants under our master shelf agreements as of december 31 2014  

cash flow 

the following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended december 31 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 4895 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 5069 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily affected by the sale of our mortgage services business and the timing of excess tax benefits from exercised stock options in the first quarter of 2013 

 net cash provided by operating activities increased to 5069 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 4682 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers partially offset by an increase in interest payments related to our bond offerings in the second quarter of 2012 we prefunded 720 million to our pension plan this prefunding was partially offset by the tax benefit associated with those deductible contributions and the deferral of our fourth quarter 2012 tax payment to 2013 as a result 

of a temporary federal tax relief program related to hurricane sandy this tax payment would have typically been paid in the fourth quarter of 2012 but due to this relief the payment was made in the first quarter of 2013 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was  355 million  and 1456 million  for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the sale of our mortgage services business for 1550 million on march 11 2014 partially offset by the acquisition of maplecroft of 301 million 

net cash used in investing activities was 1456 million  and 8836 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the fact that we had acquisitions in 2012  with a combined net cash purchase price of 8083 million versus minor acquisition activity in 2013  

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 5791 million  and 2845 million  for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the increase of net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2014  was primarily due to the repurchase of common stock of 7785 million related to the asr partially offset by net debt draw downs of 1600 million 

net cash used in financing activities was 2845 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  and net cash provided by financing was 3136 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2013  was primarily due to the repurchase of common stock of 2774 million and debt repayments of 1900 million partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and the related excess tax benefit of 1903 million 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2014  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and intangible assets pension and other post retirement benefits stock based compensation and income taxes actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company’s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered fees andor price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term usually one year revenues from transactionbased fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

the company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is postcontract customer support or pcs including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis the company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term the pcs associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term the company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include pcs and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term in addition the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 

we invoice our customers in annual quarterly or monthly installments amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met 

stock based compensation 

the fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the use of several estimates including expected term expected riskfree interest rate expected volatility and expected dividend yield 

stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the fouryear vesting period we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1 2005 which requires that stock based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 

goodwill and intangibles 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets  this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value 

as of december 31 2014  we had goodwill and net intangible assets of 16136 million which represents 688 of our total assets during 2014  we performed an impairment test as of june 30 2014  and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing including an 

estimate of future expected revenues earnings and cash flows useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units to mitigate undue influence we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill our valuation has not indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of 12071 million as of december 31 2014  for the year ended december 31 2014  there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets 

pension and postretirement 

on february 29 2012 we instituted a hard freeze which eliminates all future compensation and service credits to all participants in the pension plans see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  this standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income loss net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit credit cost additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard 

certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit credit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize quoted rates from longterm bond indices and changes in longterm bond rates over the past year cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees as part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better at the measurement date the output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year’s discount rate and quoted rates for longterm bond indices for our pension plans at december 31 2014  we determined this rate to be 399  a decrease of 075 from the 474  rate used at december 31 2013  our postretirement rate is 300  at december 31 2014  a decrease of 045 from the 345  used at december 31 2013  

the expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader longterm forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation and the current economic environment our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 4000  debt securities and 6000  equity securities as of december 31 2014  the pension plan assets were allocated 4130  debt 5680  equity securities and 190  other the veba plan target allocation is 100 debt we have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan the expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit credits costs we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 the future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under medicare part d was effectively changed this legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan we are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted 

a one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects 



income taxes 

in projecting future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of asc 740  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this interpretation we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 

we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

we estimate unrecognized tax positions of 11 million that may be recognized by december 31 2015 due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities net of additional uncertain tax positions 

as of december 31 2014  we have gross federal state and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of 473 million which will expire at various dates from 2015 through 2034 such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows 



the deferred income tax liability of 1978 million consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2014  we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of 1600 million which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1125 to 1625 depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pretax income and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instruments based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2014  a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 16 million based on our current borrowing levels

our customers use our solutions to make better decisions about risk and opportunities with greater efficiency and discipline we refer to these products and services as ‘solutions’ due to the integration among our services and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package these ‘solutions’ take various forms including data statistical models or tailored analytics all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions we believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers’ revenues and help them better manage their costs in 2013  for the lines of pc services we offer our customers included all of the top 100 pc insurance providers in the us 24 of the top 25 credit card issuers in north america and united kingdom as well as 9 of the top 10 health plan providers in the us we believe that our commitment to our customers and the embedded nature of our solutions serve to strengthen and extend our relationships 

we help those businesses address what we believe are the four primary decision making processes essential for managing risk as set forth below in the verisk risk analysis framework 

the verisk risk analysis framework 

  

these four processes correspond to various functional areas inside our customers’ operations 

 we add value by linking our solutions across these four key processes for example we use the same modeling methods to support the pricing of homeowner’s insurance policies and to quantify the actual losses when damage occurs to insured homes 

we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or longterm agreements which are typically prepaid and represented approximately 736 of our revenues in 2013  for the year ended december 31 2013  we had revenues of 15957 million  and net income of 3484 million  for the five year period ended december 31 2013  our revenues and net income grew at a compound annual growth rate or cagr of 151  and 288 respectively 

as further described below results of operations for the mortgage services business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended december 31 2013  and for all prior periods presented as necessary the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations 

our history 

we trace our history to 1971 when insurance services office inc or iso started operations as a notforprofit advisory and rating organization providing services for the us pc insurance industry iso was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators as required by law iso’s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development underwriting and rating functions today those businesses form the core of our risk assessment segment 

over the past decade we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets through our decision analytics segment our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the american insurance services group or aisg and certain operations and assets of the national insurance crime bureau in 1997 and 1998 respectively those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud to further expand our decision analytics segment we acquired air worldwide or air in 2002 the technological leader in catastrophe modeling in 2004 we entered the healthcare space by acquiring several businesses that now offer webbased analytical and reporting systems for health insurers provider organizations and selfinsured employers in 2005 we entered the mortgage sector acquiring the first of several businesses that now provide automated fraud detection compliance and decision support solutions for the us mortgage industry in 2006 to bolster our position in the insurance claims field we acquired xactware a leading supplier of estimating software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction in 2010 we acquired 3e company creating a scale presence in supply chain and environmental health and safety in 2011 and 2012 we further bolstered our healthcare solutions by acquiring health risk partners llc or hrp which provides solutions to optimize revenue improve compliance and improve quality of care for medicare advantage health plans and mediconnect global inc or mediconnect which provides medical record retrieval digitization coding extraction and analysis to the healthcare and property casualty industry also in 2012 we acquired argus information  advisory services llc or argus to expand our presence in providing information competitive benchmarking analytics and customized services to financial institutions in the payments space globally 

these acquisitions have added scale geographic reach highly skilled workforces and a wide array of new capabilities to our decision analytics segment they have helped to make us a leading provider of information and decision analytics for customers involved in the business of risk in the us and selectively around the world 

in january 2014 we entered into an agreement to acquire 100 of the stock of eagleview technology corporation or evt the parent company of pictometry international corp and eagle view technologies inc for a net cash purchase price of 650 million which will be funded by the companys operating cash and borrowings from our credit facility evt is a provider of georeferenced aerial image capture and visualcentric data analytics and solutions to insurers contractors government and commercial customers in the united states this acquisition is expected to advance our position in the imagery analytics market adding new municipal and commercial customers the transaction is expected to support the aerial imagery solution development in our decision analytics segment the parties expect the transaction to close by july 2014 subject to the completion of customary closing conditions including receipt of regulatory and shareholder approvals once the acquisition is completed we plan to include evt in the insurance vertical of our decision analytics segment 

in february 2014 we entered into an agreement to sell our mortgage services business interthinx inc or interthinx the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close by march 31 2014 results of operations for the mortgage services business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended december 31 2013  and for all prior periods presented as necessary the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations

on may 23 2008 in contemplation of our initial public offering or ipo iso formed verisk analytics inc or verisk a delaware corporation to be the holding company for our business verisk was initially formed as a whollyowned subsidiary of iso on october 6 2009 in connection with our ipo the company effected a reorganization whereby iso became a whollyowned subsidiary of verisk verisk class a common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on october 7 2009 under the symbol “vrsk” 

segments 

we organize our business in two segments risk assessment and decision analytics see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii of this annual report for additional information regarding our segments 

risk assessment segment 

our risk assessment segment serves our pc insurance customers and focuses on the first two decision making processes in our risk analysis framework prediction of loss and selection and pricing of risk within this segment we also provide solutions to help our insurance customers comply with their reporting requirements in each us state in which they operate our customers include most of the pc insurance providers in the us 

industrystandard insurance programs 

we are the recognized leader in the us for industrystandard insurance programs that help pc insurers define coverages and issue policies our policy language prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language rules and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements insurers must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law to meet their needs we process and interface with state regulators in all 50 states plus the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands in excess of 3000 filings each year ensuring smooth implementation of our rules and forms when insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs our industrystandard insurance programs also help regulators make sure that such insurers’ policies meet basic coverage requirements 

standardized coverage language which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants as a result our industrystandard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known our policy language includes standard coverage language endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they are offering with these policy programs insurers also benefit from economies of scale we have over 200 specialized lawyers and insurance experts reviewing changes in each state’s insurance rules and regulations including on average over 14000 legislative bills 1300 regulatory actions and 2000 court cases per year to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information 

to cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace we offer a broad range of policy programs for example in the homeowner’s line of insurance we maintain policy language and rules for 6 basic coverages 250 national endorsements and 548 statespecific endorsements overall we provide policy language prospective loss costs policy writing rules and a variety of other solutions for 26 lines of insurance 

the pc insurance industry is heavily regulated in the us pc insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate our statistical agent services have enabled pc insurers to meet these regulatory requirements for over 40 years we aggregate the data and as a licensed or appointed “statistical agent” in all 50 states puerto rico and the district of columbia we report these statistics to insurance regulators we are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the us pc insurance industry 

to provide our customers and the regulators the information they require we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world over the past four decades we have developed core expertise in acquiring processing managing and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our risk assessment segment we use our proprietary technology to assemble organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers we supplement this data with publicly available information 

each year pc insurers send us approximately 29 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred we maintain a database of over 173 billion statistical records including approximately 70 billion commercial lines records and approximately 103 billion personal lines records we collect unittransaction detail of each premium and loss record which enhances the validity reliability and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial analyses our proprietary quality process includes almost 2500 separate checks to ensure that data meet our high standards of quality 

we provide actuarial services to help our customers analyze and price their risks using our large database of premium and loss data our actuaries are able to perform sophisticated analyses using our predictive models and analytic methods to help our pc insurance customers with pricing loss reserving and marketing we distribute a number of actuarial solutions and offer 

flexible services to meet our customers’ needs in addition our actuarial consultants provide customized services for our clients that include assisting them with the development of independent insurance programs analysis of their own underwriting experience development of classification systems and rating plans and a wide variety of other business decisions we also supply information to a wide variety of customers in other markets including reinsurance and government agencies 

we project future losses and loss expenses utilizing a broad set of data these projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used solely their own data we make a number of actuarial adjustments before the data is used to estimate future costs our customers can use our estimates of future costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies for most pc insurers in most lines of business we believe our estimates of future costs are an essential input to rating decisions our actuarial products and services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industrystandard insurance programs described above 

propertyspecific rating and underwriting information 

we gather information on individual properties and communities so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price personal and commercial property insurance as well as commercial liability insurance our propertyspecific rating and underwriting information allow our customers to understand quantify underwrite mitigate and avoid potential loss for residential and commercial properties our database contains loss costs and other vital information on more than 35 million commercial buildings in the united states and also holds information on more than 62 million individual businesses occupying those buildings we have a staff of more than 600 field representatives strategically located around the united states who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties evaluate community fireprotection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal buildingcode enforcement each year our field staff visits more than over 325000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes 

we also provide proprietary analytic measures of the ability of individual communities to mitigate losses from important perils nearly every property insurer in the us uses our evaluations of community firefighting capabilities to help determine premiums for fire insurance throughout the country we provide fieldverified and validated data on the fire protection services for more than 47000 fire response jurisdictions we also offer services to evaluate the effectiveness of community enforcement of building codes and the efforts of communities to mitigate damage from flooding further we provide information on the insurance rating territories premium taxes crime risk and hazards of windstorm earthquake wildfire and other perils to supplement our data on specific commercial properties and individual communities we have assembled from a variety of internal and thirdparty sources information on hazards related to geographic locations representing every postal address in the us insurers use this information not only for policy quoting but also for analyzing risk concentration in geographical areas we also make our data and analytics available to commercial real estate lenders to allow them to better understand risks associated with people they lend against 

decision analytics segment 

in the decision analytics segment we support all four phases of our risk analysis framework we develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better predict loss select and price risk detect fraud before and after a loss event and quantify losses the businesses are categorized by the primary end market for their services 

      

as we develop our models to quantify loss and detect fraud we improve our ability to predict the loss and prevent the fraud from happening we believe this provides us with a significant competitive advantage over firms that do not offer solutions which operate both before and after loss events 

insurance 

we are a leading provider of frauddetection tools for the pc insurance industry our fraud solutions improve our customers’ profitability by both predicting the likelihood that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred when a claim is submitted our system searches our database and returns information about other claims filed by the same individuals or businesses either as claimants or insurers which helps our customers determine if fraud has occurred the system searches for matches in identifying information fields such as name address social security number vehicle identification number driver’s license number tax identification number or other parties to the loss our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches information from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim negotiation of a reduced award or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement 

we have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and investigations professionals to process claims and fight fraud claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against insurance fraud the benefits of a single allclaims database include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for information enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious claims and superior information for investigating fraudulent claims suspicious individuals and possible fraud rings our database contains information on approximately 921 million claims and is the world’s largest database of pc claims information used for claims and investigations insurers and other participants submit new claims  more than 210000 a day on average across all categories of the us pc insurance industry

risk assessment competitors 

our risk assessment segment operates primarily in the us pc insurance industry where we enjoy a leading market presence we have a number of competitors in specific lines or services 

we encounter competition from a number of sources including insurers who develop internal technology and actuarial methods for proprietary insurance programs competitors also include other statistical agents including the national independent statistical service the independent statistical service and other advisory organizations providing underwriting rules prospective loss costs and coverage language such as the american association of insurance services and mutual services organization although we believe none of our competitors has the breadth or depth of data we have 

competitors for our propertyspecific rating and underwriting information are primarily limited to a number of regional providers of commercial property inspections and surveys including overland solutions inc and regional reporting inc we also compete with a variety of organizations that offer consulting services primarily specialty technology and consulting firms in addition a customer may use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm for these services our competitors also include information technology product and services vendors management and strategy consulting firms including deloitte consulting llp and smaller specialized information technology firms and analytical services firms including pinnacle consulting and emb a unit of towers watson

when we find it advantageous we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings this approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows 

sales marketing and customer support 

we sell our products and services primarily through direct interaction with our clients we employ a threetier sales structure that includes salespeople product specialists and sales support as of december 31 2013  we had a sales force of 285 people within the company several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services these specialized sales teams sell specific highly technical product sets to targeted markets in coordination with account management 

to provide account management to our largest customers we segment the insurance carrier market into three groups tier one or “national” accounts constitutes our largest customers tier two or “strategic” accounts represents both larger carrier groups and middlemarket carriers tier three are the small insurance companies that may represent one line of business andor be onestate or regional writers a sales generalist is assigned to every insurer account and is responsible for our overall relationship with these insurance companies our senior executives are also involved with the senior management of our customers 

sales people participate in both customerservice and sales activities they provide direct support interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a positive experience using our services salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activity and provide the best solutions for our customers we believe our salespeople’s product knowledge and local presence differentiates us from our competition product specialists are subjectmatter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products both salespeople and product specialists have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities a team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination between the two groups 

sources of our data 

the data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions are sourced through seven different kinds of data arrangements first we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created upon their data these agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out and represent our primary method of data gathering it is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data second we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide to the data contributors their required levels of privacy protection of data and where necessary deidentification of data these agreements represent no cost to us and generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and require renewal third we “mine” data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions as an example we utilize the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models again these arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way fourth we source data generally at no cost from public sources including federal 

state and local governments fifth we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff that also perform property surveys at the request of and facilitated by property insurers sixth we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased including county tax assessor records descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses lastly we retrieve medical records from facilities and provider locations at prevailing market prices under agreements between our insurer customers and their provider networks in all our modes of data collection we are the owners of whatever derivative solutions we create using the data our costs for data received from our customers were 13 and 14 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

information technology 

technology 

our information technology systems are fundamental to our success they are used for the storage processing access and delivery of the data which forms the foundation of our business and the development and delivery of our solutions provided to our clients much of the technology we use and provide to our customers is developed maintained and supported by approximately 1289 employees we generally own or have secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business all the customerfacing applications which are material to our operations we support and implement a mix of technologies focused on implementing the most efficient technology for any given business requirement or task 

data centers 

we have two primary data centers in jersey city new jersey and orem utah creating redundancy and backup capabilities in addition we have data centers dedicated to certain business units located in other states 

disaster recovery 

we are committed to a framework for business continuity management and carry out annual reviews of the state of preparedness of each business unit all of our critical databases systems and contracted client services are also regularly recovered we also have documented disaster recovery plans in place for each of our major data centers and each of our solutions our primary data center recovery site is in new york state approximately 50 miles northwest of jersey city new jersey 

security 

we have adopted a wide range of measures to ensure the security of our it infrastructure and data security measures generally cover the following key areas physical security logical security of the perimeter network security such as firewalls logical access to the operating systems deployment of virus detection software and appropriate policies and procedures relating to removable media such as laptops all laptops are encrypted and media leaving our premises that is sent to a thirdparty storage facility is also encrypted this commitment has led us to achieve certification from cybertrust an industry leader in information security certification since 2002 

intellectual property 

we own a significant number of intellectual property rights including copyrights trademarks trade secrets and patents specifically our policy language insurance manuals software and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue we also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the us and foreign countries including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines many of which are registered we believe many of our trademarks trade names service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them we consider our intellectual property to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of statutory eg copyright trademark trade secret and patent and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect them wherever they are used 

we also own several software method and processing patents and have several pending patent applications in the us that complement our products the patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to technology including a patent for our claims outcome advisor software and for our xactware sketch product we believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and which are material to our business 

in order to maintain control of our intellectual property we enter into license agreements with our customers granting each customer a license to use our products and services including our software and databases this helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions as a 

general practice employees contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights information and technology 

employees 

as of december 31 2013  we employed 6368 fulltime and 727 parttime employees none of our employees are represented by unions we consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 

our employees include over 190 actuarial professionals including 49 fellows and 25 associates of the casualty actuarial society as well as 158 chartered property casualty underwriters 18 certified and 23 associate insurance data managers and 530 professionals with advanced degrees including phds in mathematics and statistical modeling who review both the data and the models 

regulation 

because our business involves the distribution of certain personal public and nonpublic data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility service and marketing decisions based on such data certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws in the united states and to a lesser extent foreign countries examples of such regulation include the fair credit reporting act which regulates the use of consumer credit report information the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of nonpublic personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions the health insurance portability and accountability act which restricts the public disclosure of patient information and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to healthcare businesses the drivers privacy protection act which prohibits the public disclosure use or resale by any state’s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record except for a “permissible purpose” and various other federal state and local laws and regulations 

these laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used to challenge the accuracy of such information andor to prevent the use and disclosure of such information in certain instances these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances 

we are also licensed as a rating rate service advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all fifty states puerto rico guam the virgin islands and the district of columbia as such an advisory organization we provide statistical actuarial policy language development and related products and services to propertycasualty insurers including advisory prospective loss costs other prospective cost information manual rules and policy language we also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policywriting and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators 

many of our products services and operations as well as insurer use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the mccarranferguson act as a result many of our operations and products are subject to review andor approval by state regulators furthermore our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes which are typically enforced by state attorneys general andor insurance regulators

risk factors 

tableend

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to invest any of our securities if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer in such case the trading price of our securities including our class a common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions 

we depend upon data from external sources including data received from customers and various government and public record services for information used in our databases in general we do not own the information in these databases and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons and we could also become subject to legislative judicial or contractual restrictions on the use of such data in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use andor process the data in addition some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company specifically a portion of class a common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers if our customers’ percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms if a substantial number of data sources or certain key sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

agreements with our data suppliers are shortterm agreements some suppliers are also competitors which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors an advantage such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from us pc primary insurers if there is a downturn in the us insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions our revenues will decline 

revenues derived from solutions we provide to us pc primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2013  approximately 474 of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to us pc primary insurers also invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the us pc insurance market which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control in addition our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions 

factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by pc primary insurers include the following 

 a downturn in the insurance industry filing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

acquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions 

our longterm business strategy includes growth through acquisitions future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful acquirees any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses such risks include among other things 

 the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition 

we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities although we have capacity under committed facilities those may not be sufficient therefore future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

in addition to the extent we cannot identify or consummate acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth 

there may be consolidation in our end customer market which would reduce the use of our services 

mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon for example in the pc insurance and healthcare services sector any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions our business could suffer serious harm 

our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions if we are unable to develop new solutions or if we are not successful in introducing andor obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursuewe may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate in addition significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in the past we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions primarily due to difficulties in developing models acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments errors or defects in our solutions that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection of our solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenues diversion of development resources an increase in product liability claims and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims 

we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them our business could be harmed 

our success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights to date we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and 

distribution to protect our proprietary technology this protection of our proprietary technology is limited and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent in addition patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products business we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage any disclosure loss invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and ultimately our business our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others including our competitors may use our proprietary technology without our consent furthermore litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face claims for intellectual property infringement which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers 

there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings particularly in the united states regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry there is a risk that we are infringing or may in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties we monitor thirdparty patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate however such monitoring and analysis has not been and is unlikely in the future to be comprehensive and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications since the patent application process can take several years to complete there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies as a result we may infringe existing and future thirdparty patents of which we are not aware as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 

thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions even if we prevail litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management’s time and attention 

if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop noninfringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

because personal public and nonpublic information is stored in some of our databases we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act grammleachbliley act driver’s privacy protection act health insurance portability and accountability act the european union’s data protection directive the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent various other federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace however many consumer advocates privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information particularly social security numbers department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth as a result they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation 

security breaches in our facilities computer networks and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems thirdparty contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of 

proprietary information if users gain improper access to our databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify confidential thirdparty information that is stored or transmitted on our networks 

in addition customers’ employees’ or other’s misuse of andor gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers any such misappropriation andor misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us among other things being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation 

a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways 

 incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed or any other security or privacy breaches may occur and could go undetected the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may lose key business assets including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links the internet or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 

our operations depend on our ability as well as that of thirdparty service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure fire flood power loss telecommunications failure impacts of terrorism breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers natural disasters or other disasters certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding earthquakes or other disasters the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers in addition we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time any damage to our data centers failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements resulting in decreased revenue operating income and earnings per share 

we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively 

some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive and are expected to remain highly competitive we compete on the basis of quality customer service product and service selection and price our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment due to their size certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can as a result these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences emerging technologies and market trends in addition new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away and as we enter into new lines of business due to acquisition or otherwise we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments especially against larger competitors we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete if we fail to successfully compete our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our contemplated acquisition of eagleview technology corporation will increase our leverage in addition we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition 

on january 14 2014 we announced the signing of an agreement to acquire eagleview technology corporation evt the closing of which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals in order to finance the acquisition we expect to incur approximately 475 million of indebtedness under our lending credit facility upon closing of the transaction our total debt will increase to approximately 1756 million and our leverage ratio debt to ebitda last twelve months proforma will increase from 160 to approximately 215 our increased leverage resulting from the evt acquisition could adversely affect our business in particular it could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities in addition we may fail to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition 

to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases the demand for some of our solutions may decrease 

public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 

our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of over 18  years 

however we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team if we lose key members of our senior management operating team we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers 

our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees if our attrition rate increases our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work 

if our business continues to grow the number of people we will need to hire will increase we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs 

we are subject to antitrust consumer protection and other litigation and may in the future become subject to further such litigation an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

we participate in businesses particularly insurancerelated businesses and services that are subject to substantial litigation including antitrust and consumer protection litigation in addition our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries failed to comply with the fair credit reporting act and related obligations see “item 3 legal proceedings” our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability given the nature of our business we may be subject to similar litigation in the future even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation 

could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth 

general economic political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business 

the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation the united states economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions in addition the decline of the credit markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators and therefore the immediate demand for our related mortgage solutions specifically certain of our fraud detection and prevention solutions are directed at the mortgage market this decline in asset value and originations and an increase in foreclosure levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage originations and securitizations any new regulatory regime may change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our solutions to new regulation 

if there are substantial sales of our common stock our stock price could decline 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive as of december 31 2013  our ten largest shareholders owned 464 of our class a common stock including 89 of our class a common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration and subject to limitations on the timing amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly in addition the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

pursuant to our equity incentive plans options to purchase approximately 8947727 shares of class a common stock were outstanding as of february 21 2014  we filed a registration statement under the securities act which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans including for such outstanding options as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

also in the future we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 

our capital structure level of indebtedness and the terms of antitakeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 20 

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us as a public company we are subject to section 203 which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 150 or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions but we do not intend to do so 

these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future

we are party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business including those matters described below with respect to the ongoing matters we are unable at the present time to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows this is primarily because the matters are generally in early stages and discovery has either not commenced or been completed although we believe we have strong defenses and intend to vigorously defend these matters we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

intellicorp records inc litigation and iix litigation

we organize our business in two segments risk assessment and decision analytics our risk assessment segment provides statistical actuarial and underwriting data for the us pc insurance industry our risk assessment segment revenues represented approximately 387 and 412 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively effective december 31 2012 we combined the statistical agency and data services and actuarial services into industrystandard insurance programs within our risk assessment segment our decision analytics segment provides solutions our customers use 

to analyze the processes of the verisk risk analysis framework prediction of loss detection and prevention of fraud and quantification of loss effective december 31 2011 we realigned the revenue categories within our decision analytics segment including fraud identification and detection solutions loss prediction solutions and loss quantification solutions into four vertical marketrelated groupings of insurance financial services healthcare and specialized markets we believe that this enhances financial reporting transparency and helps investors better understand the themes within the decision analytics segment our decision analytics segment revenues represented approximately 613 and 588 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

in january 2014 we entered into an agreement to acquire 100 of the stock of eagleview technology corporation “evt” the parent company of pictometry international corp and eagle view technologies inc for a net cash purchase price of 650 million which will be funded by the companys operating cash and borrowings from our credit facility evt is a provider of georeferenced aerial image capture and visualcentric data analytics and solutions to insurers contractors government and commercial customers in the united states this acquisition is expected to advance our position in the imagery analytics market adding new municipal and commercial customers the transaction is expected to support the aerial imagery solution development in our decision analytics segment the parties expect the transaction to close by july 2014 subject to the completion of customary closing conditions including receipt of regulatory and shareholder approvals once the acquisition is completed we plan to include evt in the insurance vertical of our decision analytics segment

executive summary 

key performance metrics 

we believe our business’s ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy we use year over year revenue growth and ebitda margin as metrics to measure our performance ebitda and ebitda margin are nongaap financial measures see note 3 within item 6 selected financial data section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

revenue growth  we use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers sales to new customers sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses 

ebitda margin  we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth 

revenues 

we earn revenues through subscriptions longterm agreements and on a transactional basis subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year as a result the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period in general we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business our longterm agreements are generally for periods of three to five years we recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most longterm agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 

certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis for example we have solutions that allow our customers to obtain propertyspecific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building or compare a pc insurance medical or workers’ compensation claim with information in our databases for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  264 and 276 of our revenues respectively were derived from providing transactional solutions 

we earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed in general transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month 

approximately 882 and 871 of the revenues in our risk assessment segment for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions our customers in this segment include most of the pc insurance providers in the united states approximately 644  and 621 of the revenues in our decision analytics segment for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions 

principal operating costs and expenses 

personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses which represented 597 and 626 of our total expenses for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively include salaries benefits incentive compensation equity compensation costs sales commissions employment taxes recruiting costs and outsourced temporary agency costs 

we allocate personnel expenses between two categories cost of revenues and selling general and administrative costs based on the actual costs associated with each employee we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues and all other personnel including executive managers sales people marketing business development finance legal human resources and administrative services as selling general and administrative expenses a significant portion of our other operating costs such as facilities and communications are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed 

while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues historically our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses however part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions which may offset margin expansion 

cost of revenues  our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our nextgeneration solutions our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization 

selling general and administrative expense  our selling general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities insurance and communications are also allocated to selling general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee our selling general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization 

trends affecting our business 

we serve customers in three primary vertical markets propertycasualty insurance healthcare and financial services the industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business 

growth in propertycasualty insurers’ direct written premiums is cyclical with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 147 in 2002 to a trough of negative 31 in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 44 in 2012 and 41 through ninemonths 2013 based on reports of firming in insurance markets and assuming modest growth in the economy we expect premium growth near recent rates through 2014 growth or decline in premiums for the lines of insurance for which we perform services could positively or negatively affect our revenues because premium growth can affect the volume of solutions as well as the number and types of solutions our customers buy also we link the invoices of certain solutions in part to an individual customer’s premiums from prior years for a portion of our customers the pricing for those solutions is fixed at the beginning of each calendar year we have also signed multiyear contracts with certain customers and for those customers pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multiyear period 

trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers’ profitability and therefore their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks the apparent increase in the frequency and severity of weather events that cause losses for insurers could lead to increased demand for our catastrophe modeling catastrophe loss information and repair cost solutions a significant decrease in the number or severity of catastrophes could negatively affect our revenues we also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity 

the need by our customers to fight insurance fraud — both in claims and at policy inception — could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions additionally a significant change in insurers’ profitability could positively or negatively affect demand for our solutions 

trends in the us healthcare market can affect a portion of our revenues in the decision analytics segment that market is undergoing significant change as the result of healthcare reform legislation the specific trends we see affecting our current healthcare business include payment reform expansion of insurance coverage and efforts at cost containment payment reform will likely drive the market to valuebased reimbursement and require healthcare providers to bear increased financial risk and responsibility for quality outcomes the expansion of insurance eligibility will increase medicaid rolls and promote participation in statewide health exchanges and as the government seeks to control fraud waste and abuse efforts to contain costs will likely become more prevalent although such changes have the potential to disrupt the healthcare marketplace we believe the requirements for reform could increase demand for our analytic solutions in the areas of population management quality measurement medicare advantage revenue management and compliance risk adjustment and detection of prepayment fraud and abuse we experience seasonality in our medicare advantage business tied to third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year related to cms deadlines

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2013  in management’s opinion the quarterly data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and reflects all necessary adjustments 

for a fair presentation of this data the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period 



liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2013  and 2012  we had cash and cash equivalents and availableforsale securities of 1697 million and 947 million respectively subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year we have historically generated significant cash flows from operations as a result of this factor as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and to fuel our future growth plans 

we have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that as described above we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or longterm contracts which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered when cash is received for prepayment of invoices we record an asset cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability fees received in advance this current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services in most businesses growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows unlike these businesses our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services 

our capital expenditures which include noncash purchases of fixed assets and capital lease obligations as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  were 92 and 52 respectively we estimate our capital expenditures for 2014 will be approximately 1470 million which primarily include expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with asc 35040 “ accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use ” we also capitalize amounts in accordance with asc 98520 “ software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed ”

in prior years we provided pension and postretirement benefits to certain qualifying active employees and retirees on february 29 2012 we instituted a hard freeze which eliminated all future compensation and service credits to all participants in the pension plans in april 2012 we completed a voluntary prefunding to our qualified pension plan of 720 million which resulted in a contribution of 788 million for the year of which 282 million was the minimum contribution requirement for 2012 as a result of the prefunding we do not expect to make any contribution in 2014 with respect to our qualified pension plan under the postretirement plan we provided certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying participants however participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the premium coverage in march 2012 we established a voluntary employee’s beneficiary association plan or veba plan to fund the postretirement plan we contributed 200 million to the veba plan during the year ended december 31 2012 we expect to contribute approximately 18 million to the postretirement plan in 2014 see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by iso and certain subsidiaries that guarantee our syndicated revolving credit facility “credit facility” or any amendment 

refinancing or replacement thereof we expect to redraw from our credit facility over time as needed for our corporate strategy including for general corporate purposes and acquisitions the indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things create certain liens enter into saleleaseback transactions and consolidate with sell lease convey or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets or merge with or into any other person or entity

cash flow 

the following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended december 31 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased to 5069 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 4682 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers partially offset by an increase in interest payments related to our bond offerings in the second quarter of 2012 we prefunded 720 million to our pension plan this prefunding was partially offset by the tax benefit associated with those deductible contributions and the deferral of our fourth quarter 2012 tax payment to 2013 as a result of a temporary federal tax relief program related to hurricane sandy this tax payment would have typically been paid in the fourth quarter of 2012 but due to this relief the payment was made in the first quarter of 2013 

net cash provided by operating activities increased to 4682 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 3757 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  the increase in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers and the deferral of our fourth quarter 2012 federal tax payment to 2013 as a result of a temporary 

federal tax relief program related to hurricane sandy this increase was partially offset by an increase in operating expense payments primarily related to the voluntary prefunding of our qualified pension plan in 2012 and interest payments during the year ended december 31 2012 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 1456 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  and 8836 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the fact that we had acquisitions in 2012 with a combined net cash purchase price of 8083 million versus minor acquisition activity in 2013 

net cash used in investing activities was 8836 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  and 2041 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  the increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to an increase in acquisition payments of 6478 million primarily related to the acquisitions of mediconnect and argus in the first and third quarters of 2012 respectively an increase in escrow funding associated with these acquisitions of 192 million and an increase in purchases of fixed assets of 145 million during the year ended december 31 2012

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2013  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and intangible assets pension and other post retirement benefits stock based compensation and income taxes actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company’s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered fees andor price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term usually one year revenues from transactionbased fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

the company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is postcontract customer support or pcs including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis the company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term the pcs associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term the company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include pcs and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term in addition the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 

we invoice our customers in annual quarterly or monthly installments amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met 

stock based compensation 

the fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the use of several estimates including expected term expected riskfree interest rate expected volatility and expected dividend yield 

stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period option grants and restricted stock awards are expensed ratably over the fouryear vesting period we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1 2005 which requires that stock based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 

goodwill and intangibles 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets  this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value 

as of december 31 2013  we had goodwill and net intangible assets of 16293 million which represents 651 of our total assets during 2013  we performed an impairment test as of june 30 2013  and confirmed that no impairment charge was 

necessary there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing including an estimate of future expected revenues earnings and cash flows useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units to mitigate undue influence we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill our valuation has not indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of 11817 million as of december 31 2013  for the year ended december 31 2013  there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets 

pension and postretirement 

on february 29 2012 we instituted a hard freeze which will eliminate all future compensation and service credits to all participants in the pension plans see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  this standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income loss net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard 

certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize quoted rates from longterm bond indices and changes in longterm bond rates over the past year cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees as part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better at the measurement date the output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year’s discount rate and quoted rates for longterm bond indices for our pension plans at december 31 2013  we determined this rate to be 474 an increase of 076 from the 398 rate used at december 31 2012  our postretirement rate is 345 at december 31 2013  an increase of 070 from the 275 used at december 31 2012  

the expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader longterm forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation and the current economic environment our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 4000 debt securities and 6000 equity securities as of december 31 2013  the pension plan assets were allocated 3320 debt and 6680 equity securities the veba plan target allocation is 100 debt we have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan the expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit costs we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 the future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under medicare part d was effectively changed this legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan we are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted 

a one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects 



income taxes 

in projecting future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of asc 740  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this interpretation we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 

we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

we estimate unrecognized tax positions of 39 million that may be recognized by december 31 2014 due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities net of additional uncertain tax positions 

as of december 31 2013  we have gross federal state and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of 797 million which will expire at various dates from 2014 through 2033 such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows 



as of december 31 2013  deferred tax liabilities of 702  were recorded primarily attributable to timing differences involving pensions depreciation and amortization as of december 31 2012  deferred tax liabilities in the amount of 408 million and 402 million were recorded in connection with the acquisitions of mediconnect and argus respectively other increases in deferred tax liabilities in 2012  of 567 million were primarily due to increased contributions to the pension and postretirement plans in the current period as well as the other timing differences attributable to depreciation and amortization

the verisk risk analysis framework 

 

these four processes correspond to various functional areas inside our customers’ operations

our history 

we trace our history to 1971 when insurance services office inc or iso started operations as a notforprofit advisory and rating organization providing services for the us pc insurance industry iso was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators as required by law iso’s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development underwriting and rating functions today those businesses form the core of our risk assessment segment 

over the past decade we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets through our decision analytics segment our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the american insurance services group or aisg and certain operations and assets of the national insurance crime bureau in 1997 and 1998 respectively those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud to further expand our decision analytics

segments 

we organize our business in two segments risk assessment and decision analytics see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii of this annual report for information regarding our segments 

risk assessment segment 

our risk assessment segment serves our pc insurance customers and focuses on the first two decision making processes in our risk analysis framework prediction of loss and selection and pricing of risk within this segment we also provide solutions to help our insurance customers comply with their reporting requirements in each us state in which they operate our customers include most of the pc insurance providers in the us 

industrystandard insurance programs 

we are the recognized leader in the us for industrystandard insurance programs that help pc insurers define coverages and issue policies our policy language prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language rules and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements insurers must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law to meet their needs we process and interface with state regulators on average over 2800 

  

filings each year ensuring smooth implementation of our rules and forms when insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs our industrystandard insurance programs also help regulators make sure that such insurers’ policies meet basic coverage requirements 

standardized coverage language which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants as a result our industrystandard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known our policy language includes standard coverage language endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they are offering with these policy programs insurers also benefit from economies of scale we have over 200 specialized lawyers and insurance experts reviewing changes in each state’s insurance rules and regulations including on average over 9200 legislative bills 1000 regulatory actions and 2000 court cases per year to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information 

to cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace we offer a broad range of policy programs for example in the homeowner’s line of insurance we maintain policy language and rules for 6 basic coverages 255 national endorsements and 514 statespecific endorsements overall we provide policy language prospective loss costs policy writing rules and a variety of other solutions for 26 lines of insurance 

the pc insurance industry is heavily regulated in the us pc insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate our statistical agent services have enabled pc insurers to meet these regulatory requirements for over 40 years we aggregate the data and as a licensed or appointed “statistical agent” in all 50 states puerto rico guam us virgin islands and the district of columbia we report these statistics to insurance regulators we are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the us pc insurance industry 

to provide our customers and the regulators the information they require we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world over the past four decades we have developed core expertise in acquiring processing managing and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our risk assessment segment we use our proprietary technology to assemble organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers we supplement this data with publicly available information 

each year pc insurers send us approximately 29 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred we maintain a database of over 165 billion statistical records including approximately 65 billion commercial lines records and approximately 100 billion personal lines records we collect unittransaction detail of each premium and loss record which enhances the validity reliability and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial analyses our proprietary quality process includes almost 2500 separate checks to ensure that data meet our high standards of quality 

we provide actuarial services to help our customers analyze and price their risks using our large database of premium and loss data our actuaries are able to perform sophisticated analyses using our predictive models and analytic methods to help our pc insurance customers with pricing loss reserving and marketing we distribute a number of actuarial solutions and offer flexible services to meet our customers’ needs in addition our actuarial consultants provide customized services for our clients that include assisting them with the development of independent insurance programs analysis of their own underwriting experience development of classification systems and rating plans and a wide variety of other business decisions we also supply information to a wide variety of customers in other markets including reinsurance and government agencies 

we project future losses and loss expenses utilizing a broad set of data these projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used solely their own data we make a number of actuarial adjustments before the data is used to estimate future costs our customers can use our estimates of future costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies for most pc insurers in most lines of business we believe 

  

our estimates of future costs are an essential input to rating decisions our actuarial products and services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industrystandard insurance programs described above 

propertyspecific rating and underwriting information 

we gather information on individual properties and communities so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price personal and commercial property insurance as well as commercial liability insurance our propertyspecific rating and underwriting information allow our customers to understand quantify underwrite mitigate and avoid potential loss for residential and commercial properties our database contains loss costs and other vital information on more than 34 million commercial buildings in the united states and also holds information on more than 61 million individual businesses occupying those buildings we have a staff of more than 550 field representatives strategically located around the united states who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties evaluate community fireprotection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal buildingcode enforcement each year our field staff visits more than over 300000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes 

we also provide proprietary analytic measures of the ability of individual communities to mitigate losses from important perils nearly every property insurer in the us uses our evaluations of community firefighting capabilities to help determine premiums for fire insurance throughout the country we provide fieldverified and validated data on the fire protection services for more than 46000 fire response jurisdictions we also offer services to evaluate the effectiveness of community enforcement of building codes and the efforts of communities to mitigate damage from flooding further we provide information on the insurance rating territories premium taxes crime risk and hazards of windstorm earthquake wildfire and other perils to supplement our data on specific commercial properties and individual communities we have assembled from a variety of internal and thirdparty sources information on hazards related to geographic locations representing every postal address in the us insurers use this information not only for policy quoting but also for analyzing risk concentration in geographical areas 

decision analytics segment 

in the decision analytics segment we support all four phases of our risk analysis framework we develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better predict loss select and price risk detect fraud before and after a loss event and quantify losses the businesses are categorized by the primary end market for their services 

 

  

as we develop our models to quantify loss and detect fraud we improve our ability to predict the loss and prevent the fraud from happening we believe this provides us with a significant competitive advantage over firms that do not offer solutions which operate both before and after loss events

when we find it advantageous we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings this approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows 

sales marketing and customer support 

we sell our products and services primarily through direct interaction with our clients we employ a threetier sales structure that includes salespeople product specialists and sales support as of december 31 2012 we had a sales force of 295 people within the company several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services these specialized sales teams sell specific highly technical product sets to targeted markets 

  

to provide account management to our largest customers we segment the insurance carrier market into three groups tier one or “national” accounts constitutes our largest customers tier two or “strategic” accounts represents both larger carrier groups and middlemarket carriers tier three are the small insurance companies that may represent one line of business andor be onestate or regional writers a sales generalist is assigned to every insurer account and is responsible for our overall relationship with these insurance companies our senior executives are also involved with the senior management of our customers 

sales people participate in both customerservice and sales activities they provide direct support interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a positive experience using our services salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activity and provide the best solutions for our customers we believe our salespeople’s product knowledge and local presence differentiates us from our competition product specialists are subjectmatter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products both salespeople and product specialists have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities a team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination between the two groups 

sources of our data 

the data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions are sourced through seven different kinds of data arrangements first we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created upon their data these agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out and represent our primary method of data gathering it is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data second we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide to the data contributors their required levels of privacy protection of data and where necessary deidentification of data these agreements represent no cost to us and generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and require renewal third we “mine” data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions as an example we utilize the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models again these arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way fourth we source data generally at no cost from public sources including federal state and local governments fifth we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff that also perform property surveys at the request of and facilitated by property insurers sixth we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased including county tax assessor records descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses lastly we retrieve medical records from facilities and provider locations at prevailing market prices in all our modes of data collection we are the owners of whatever derivative solutions we create using the data our costs of data received from our customers were 13 and 15 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

information technology

intellectual property 

we own a significant number of intellectual property rights including copyrights trademarks trade secrets and patents specifically our policy language insurance manuals software and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue we also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the us and foreign countries including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines many of which are registered we believe many of our trademarks trade names service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them we consider our intellectual property to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of statutory eg copyright trademark trade secret and patent and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect them wherever they are used 

we also own several software method and processing patents and have several pending patent applications in the us that complement our products the patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to technology including a patent for our claims outcome advisor software and for our xactware sketch product we believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and which are material to our business 

in order to maintain control of our intellectual property we enter into license agreements with our customers granting each customer a license to use our products and services including our software and databases this helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions as a general practice employees contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights information and technology

regulation 

because our business involves the distribution of certain personal public and nonpublic data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility service and marketing decisions based on such data certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws in the united states and to a lesser extent foreign countries examples of such regulation include the fair credit reporting act which regulates the use of consumer credit report information the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of nonpublic personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions the health insurance portability and accountability act which restricts the public disclosure of patient information and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to healthcare businesses the drivers privacy protection act which prohibits the public disclosure use or resale by any state’s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record except for a “permissible purpose” and various other federal state and local laws and regulations 

these laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used to challenge the accuracy of such information andor to prevent the use and disclosure of such information in certain instances these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances 

we are also licensed as a rating rate service advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all fifty states puerto rico guam the virgin islands and the district of columbia as such an advisory organization we provide statistical actuarial policy language development and related products and services to propertycasualty insurers including advisory prospective loss costs other prospective cost information manual rules and policy language we also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policywriting and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators 

many of our products services and operations as well as insurer use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the mccarranferguson act as a result many of our operations and products are subject to review andor approval by state regulators furthermore our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes which are typically enforced by state attorneys general andor insurance regulators

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to invest in shares of our class a common stock if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer in such case the trading price of our class a common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions 

we depend upon data from external sources including data received from customers and various government and public record services for information used in our databases in general we do not own the information in these databases and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons and we could also become subject to legislative judicial or contractual restrictions on the use of such data in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use andor process the data in addition some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company specifically a portion of class a common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers if our customers’ percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms if a substantial number of data sources or certain key sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

agreements with our data suppliers are shortterm agreements some suppliers are also competitors which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors an advantage such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from us pc primary insurers if there is a downturn in the us insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions our revenues will decline 

revenues derived from solutions we provide to us pc primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 483 of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to us pc primary insurers also pricing of certain of our solutions are linked to premiums in the us pc insurance market which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss 

  

experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control in addition our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions 

factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by pc primary insurers include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a downturn in the insurance industry or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our revenues from customers in the mortgage vertical is largely transactional and subject to changing conditions of the us mortgage market 

revenue derived from solutions we provide the us mortgage and mortgagerelated industries accounted for approximately 85 of our total revenue in the year ended december 31 2012 our forensic audits business and business with governmentsponsored entities in the mortgage business accounted for approximately 520 of our total mortgage and mortgagerelated revenue in 2012 because our business relies on transaction volumes based on both new mortgage applications and forensic audit of funded loans reductions in either the volume of mortgage loans originated or the number or quality of funded loans could reduce our revenue recently there have been proposals to restructure or eliminate the roles of fannie mae and freddie mac the restructuring or elimination of either fannie mae or freddie mac could have a negative effect on the u s mortgage market and on our revenue derived from the solutions we provide to the mortgage industry if origination volumes and applications for mortgages decline our revenue in this part of the business may decline if we are unable to increase the percentage of mortgages examined for existing customers or add new customers our forensic audit business has benefited from the high amount of bad loans to be examined by mortgage insurers and other parties as a result of the us mortgage crisis certain mortgage insurers who have been operating under regulatory waivers of capital sufficiency requirements have announced that they are currently unable to write new mortgage insurance policies unless regulatory relief is provided such a development could impact the volume of loans to be examined in our forensic audit business and could reduce our revenue and profitability additionally a withdrawal of mortgage insurers from the mortgage loan market could potentially reduce the volume of loan originations which could reduce the revenue in our originationrelated business two customers represented the majority of our mortgage revenue in 2012 and if their volumes decline and we are not able to replace such volumes with new customers our revenue may continue to decline 

there may be consolidation in our end customer market which would reduce the use of our services 

mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon for example in the pc insurance and healthcare services sector any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions our business could suffer serious harm 

our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions if we are unable to develop new solutions or if we are not successful in introducing andor obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate in addition significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in the past we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions primarily due to difficulties in developing models acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments errors or defects in our solutions that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection of our solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenues diversion of development resources an increase in product liability claims and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims 

we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them our business could be harmed 

our success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights to date we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology this protection of our proprietary technology is limited and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent in addition patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products any disclosure loss invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and ultimately our business our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others including our competitors may use our proprietary technology without our consent furthermore litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face claims for intellectual property infringement which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers 

there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings particularly in the united states regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry there is a risk that we are infringing or may in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties we monitor thirdparty patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analyses where we deem appropriate however such monitoring and analysis has not been and is unlikely in the future to be comprehensive and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications since the patent application process can take several years to complete there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies as a result we may infringe existing and future thirdparty patents of which we are not aware as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 

thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions even if we prevail litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management’s time and attention 

  

if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop noninfringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

because personal public and nonpublic information is stored in some of our databases we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act grammleachbliley act driver’s privacy protection act health insurance portability and accountability act the european union’s data protection directive the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent various other federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace however many consumer advocates privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information particularly social security numbers department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth as a result they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse affect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

  

  

  

 fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation 

security breaches in our facilities computer networks and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems thirdparty contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information if users gain improper access to our databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify confidential thirdparty information that is stored or transmitted on our networks 

in addition customers’ or other’s misuse of andor gaining unpermitted access to our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers any such misappropriation andor misuse of our information could result in us among other things being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation 

a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed or any other security or privacy breaches may occur and could go undetected the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may lose key business assets including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links the internet or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 

our operations depend on our ability as well as that of thirdparty service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure fire flood power loss telecommunications failure impacts of terrorism breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers natural disasters or other disasters certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding earthquakes or other disasters the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers in addition we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time any damage to our data centers failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements resulting in decreased revenue operating income and earnings per share 

we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively 

some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive and are expected to remain highly competitive we compete on the basis of quality customer service product and service selection and price our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment due to their size certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can as a result these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences emerging technologies and market trends in addition new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments especially against larger competitors we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete if we fail to successfully compete our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

acquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions 

our longterm business strategy includes growth through acquisitions future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses such risks include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition 

we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities although we have capacity under committed facilities much of our capacity is under our uncommitted facilities under which lenders are not required to loan us any funds therefore future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

in addition to the extent we cannot identify or consummate acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business we may not experience difficulty in achieving future growth 

our acquisition of argus increased our leverage in addition we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition 

on august 31 2012 we completed our acquisition of argus in order to finance the acquisition we incurred 3800 million of indebtedness under our lending credit facility on august 31 2012 our total debt increased to approximately 16000 million and our leverage ratio debt to ebitda last twelve months proforma increased from 190x to 234x and as of december 31 2012 our total debt was approximately 14614 million and our leverage ratio was 211x our increased leverage resulting from the argus acquisition could adversely affect our business in particular it could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities in addition we may fail to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition 

  

to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases the demand for some of our solutions may decrease 

public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 

our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of over twenty years 

however with the exception of frank j coyne our chairman and chief executive officer we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team if we lose key members of our senior management operating team we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers 

our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees if our attrition rate increases our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work 

if our business continues to grow the number of people we will need to hire will increase we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs 

we are subject to antitrust consumer protection and other litigation and may in the future become subject to further such litigation an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

we participate in businesses particularly insurancerelated businesses and services that are subject to substantial litigation including antitrust and consumer protection litigation we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries failed to comply with the fair credit reporting act and related obligations see “item 3 legal proceedings” our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability given the nature of our business we may be subject to similar litigation in the future even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation 

  

could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth 

general economic political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business 

the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation the united states economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions in addition the decline of the credit markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators and therefore the immediate demand for our related mortgage solutions specifically certain of our fraud detection and prevention solutions are directed at the mortgage market this decline in asset value and originations and an increase in foreclosure levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage originations and securitizations any new regulatory regime may change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our solutions to new regulation 

if there are substantial sales of our common stock our stock price could decline 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive 

as of december 31 2012 our stockholders who owned our shares prior to the ipo and followon offering continue to beneficially own a portion of our class a common stock primarily owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop representing in aggregate approximately 146 of our outstanding common stock such stockholders will be able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration and subject to limitations on the timing amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly in addition the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

pursuant to our equity incentive plans options to purchase approximately 12276269 shares of class a common stock were outstanding as of february 21 2013 we filed a registration statement under the securities act which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans including for such outstanding options as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

also in the future we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 

  

our capital structure level of indebtedness and the terms of antitakeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us as a public company we are subject to section 203 which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 150 or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions but we do not intend to do so 

these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k as well as the discussion under “selected consolidated financial data” this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including but not limited to those listed under “risk factors” and “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

we enable riskbearing businesses to better understand and manage their risks we provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that combined with our analytic methods creates embedded decision support solutions we are the largest aggregator and provider of data pertaining to us property and casualty or pc insurance risks we offer solutions for detecting fraud in the us pc insurance financial and healthcare industries and sophisticated methods to predict and quantify loss in diverse contexts ranging from natural catastrophes to supply chain to health insurance 

our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions with greater efficiency and discipline we refer to these products and services as “solutions” due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products these solutions take various forms including data statistical models or tailored analytics all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions we believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers’ revenues and help them better manage their costs 

on may 23 2008 in contemplation of our ipo insurance service office inc or iso formed verisk analytics inc or verisk a delaware corporation to be the holding company for our business verisk was initially formed as a whollyowned subsidiary of iso on october 6 2009 in connection with our ipo we effected a reorganization whereby iso became a whollyowned subsidiary of verisk 

on october 1 2010 we completed a followon public offering we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering the primary purpose of the offering was to manage and organize the sale by class b insurance company shareholders while providing incremental public float concurrently with the closing of the offering we repurchased shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 1925 million directly from selling shareholders owning class b common stock we converted all class b shares to class a shares in 2011 and currently have no outstanding class b shares 

  

we organize our business in two segments risk assessment and decision analytics our risk assessment segment provides statistical actuarial and underwriting data for the us pc insurance industry our risk assessment segment revenues represented approximately 378 and 423 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively effective december 31 2012 we combined the statistical agency and data services and actuarial services into industrystandard insurance programs within our risk assessment segment our decision analytics segment provides solutions our customers use to analyze the processes of the verisk risk analysis framework prediction of loss detection and prevention of fraud and quantification of loss effective december 31 2011 we realigned the revenue categories within our decision analytics segment including fraud identification and detection solutions loss prediction solutions and loss quantification solutions into four vertical marketrelated groupings of insurance mortgage and financial services healthcare and specialized markets we believe that this enhances financial reporting transparency and helps investors better understand the themes within the decision analytics segment our decision analytics segment revenues represented approximately 622 and 577 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

executive summary 

key performance metrics 

we believe our business’s ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy we use year over year revenue growth and ebitda margin as metrics to measure our performance ebitda and ebitda margin are nongaap financial measures see note 3 within item 6 selected financial data section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

revenue growth we use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers sales to new customers sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses 

ebitda margin we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth 

revenues 

we earn revenues through subscriptions longterm agreements and on a transactional basis subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year as a result the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period in general we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business our longterm agreements are generally for periods of three to five years we recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most longterm agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 

certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis for example we have solutions that allow our customers to access fraud detection tools in the context of an individual mortgage application or loan obtain propertyspecific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building or compare a pc insurance medical or workers’ compensation claim with information in our databases for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 328 and 311 of our revenues respectively were derived from providing transactional solutions we earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed in general transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month 

  

approximately 871 and 857 of the revenues in our risk assessment segment for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions our customers in this segment include most of the pc insurance providers in the united states approximately 552 and 566 of the revenues in our decision analytics segment for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions 

principal operating costs and expenses 

personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses which represented 625 and 653 of our total expenses for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively include salaries benefits incentive compensation equity compensation costs sales commissions employment taxes recruiting costs and outsourced temporary agency costs 

we allocate personnel expenses between two categories cost of revenues and selling general and administrative costs based on the actual costs associated with each employee we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues and all other personnel including executive managers sales people marketing business development finance legal human resources and administrative services as selling general and administrative expenses a significant portion of our other operating costs such as facilities and communications are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed 

while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues historically our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses however part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions which may offset margin expansion 

cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our nextgeneration solutions our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization

we serve customers in three primary vertical markets propertycasualty insurance healthcare and financial services the industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business 

growth in propertycasualty insurers’ direct written premiums is cyclical with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 147 in 2002 to a trough of negative 31 in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 36 in 2011 and 44 through ninemonths 2012 based on reports of firming in insurance markets and assuming modest growth in the economy we expect premium growth at or above recent rates through 2013growth or decline in premiums for the lines of insurance for which we perform services could positively or negatively affect our revenues because premium growth can affect the volume of solutions as well as the number and types of solutions our customers buy also we link the pricing of certain solutions in part to an individual customer’s premiums from prior years the pricing for those solutions is fixed at the beginning of each calendar year we have also signed multiyear contracts with certain customers and for those customers pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multiyear period 

  

trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers’ profitability and therefore their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks the apparent increase in the frequency and severity of weather events that cause losses for insurers could lead to increased demand for our catastrophe modeling catastrophe loss information and repair cost solutions a significant decrease in the number or severity of catastrophes could negatively affect our revenues 

the need by our customers to fight insurance fraud — both in claims and at policy inception — could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions additionally a significant change in insurers’ profitability could positively or negatively affect demand for our solutions 

trends in the us healthcare market can affect a portion of our revenues in the decision analytics segment that market is undergoing significant change as the result of healthcare reform legislation the specific trends we see affecting our current healthcare business include payment reform expansion of insurance coverage and efforts at cost containment payment reform will likely drive the market to valuebased reimbursement and require healthcare providers to bear increased financial risk and responsibility for quality outcomes the expansion of insurance eligibility will presumably increase medicaid rolls and promote participation in statewide health exchanges and as the government seeks to control fraud waste and abuse efforts to contain costs will likely become more prevalent although such changes have the potential to disrupt the healthcare marketplace we believe the requirements for reform could increase demand for our analytic solutions in the areas of population management quality measurement medicare advantage revenue intelligence and optimization risk adjustment and detection of prepayment fraud and abuse 

trends in the us financial market can affect a portion of our revenues in the decision analytics segment the volume of applications for new mortgages or refinancing of existing mortgages can affect a portion of our mortgagerelated revenues based on estimates by the mortgage bankers association as of january 15 2013 we expect mortgage origination activity new originations and refinancing to decrease in 2013 that could have a negative effect on our revenues however regulatory and economic conditions could also affect our revenues the current regulatory environment has created a flight to quality among residential lenders in the united states that could create increased demand for our solutions that help customers focus on improved underwriting quality of mortgage loans conversely a continued reduction of loan inventories related to foreclosures and early payment defaults may have an adverse effect on activities related to the analysis and curing of those loans in the payments industry continued growth in debit and credit card usage could positively impact our financial services’ solutions revenue

we have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that as described above we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or longterm contracts which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered when cash is received for prepayment of invoices we record an asset cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability fees received in advance this current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services in most businesses growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows unlike these businesses our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services 

our capital expenditures which include noncash purchases of fixed assets and capital lease obligations as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 were 52 and 51 respectively we estimate our capital expenditures for 2013 will be approximately 1150 million which primarily include expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our 

  

solutions expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with asc 35040 “ accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use ” we also capitalize amounts in accordance with asc 98520 “ software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed ” 

we have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we repurchased 1626 million 3807 million and 4223 million respectively of our common stock included in the 2010 share repurchases are 2098 million of class b including repurchases of 1999 million and 99 million of verisk class b1 and class b2 respectively which were not a part of the repurchase program 

in prior years we provided pension and postretirement benefits to certain qualifying active employees and retirees on february 29 2012 we instituted a hard freeze which eliminated all future compensation and service credits to all participants in the pension plans in april 2012 we completed a voluntary prefunding to our qualified pension plan of 720 million which resulted in a contribution of 788 million for the year of which 282 million was the minimum contribution requirement for 2012 as a result of the prefunding we do not expect to make any contribution in 2013 with respect to our qualified pension plan under the postretirement plan we provided certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying participants however participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the premium coverage in march 2012 we established a voluntary employee’s beneficiary association plan or veba plan to fund the postretirement plan we contributed 200 million to the veba plan during the year ended december 31 2012 we expect to contribute approximately 11 million to the postretirement plan in 2013 see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

financing and financing capacity 

we had total debt excluding capital lease and other obligations of 14544 million and 10967 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the debt at december 31 2012 is primarily issued under longterm private placement loan facilities and senior notes issued to finance our stock repurchases and acquisitions 

on april 6 2011 we completed an issuance of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of 4500 million these senior notes are due on may 1 2021 and accrue interest at a rate of 5800 per annum we received net proceeds of 4460 million after deducting original issue discount and underwriting discounts and commissions of 40 million these discounts and commissions are amortized over the tenyear period which is consistent with the remaining life of the notes interest is payable semiannually on may 1st and november 1st each year beginning on november 1 2011 

on december 8 2011 we completed a second issuance of senior notes in the aggregate principal of 2500 million these senior notes are due on january 15 2019 and accrue interest at a rate of 4875 per annum we received new proceeds of 2460 million after deducting original issue discount and underwriting discounts and commissions of 40 million these discounts and commissions will be amortized over a sevenyear period which is consistent with the remaining life of the notes interest is payable semiannually on january 15th and july 15th of each year beginning on july 15 2012

the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by iso and certain subsidiaries that guarantee our syndicated revolving credit facility “credit facility” or any amendment refinancing or replacement thereof we expect to redraw from our credit facility over time as needed for our corporate strategy including for general corporate purposes and acquisitions the indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things create certain liens enter into saleleaseback transactions and consolidate with sell lease convey or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets or merge with or into any other person or entity 

on september 28 2012 we amended our committed senior unsecured credit facility with bank of america na jpmorgan chase bank na wells fargo na suntrust bank rbs citizens na morgan stanley bank na td bank na sovereign bank na and the northern trust company to increase the borrowing capacity under the credit facility from 7250 million to 8500 million extend the maturity date from october 24 2016 to october 24 2017 and increase the maximum consolidated funded debt leverage ratio from 325to10 to 350to10 we amortize all onetime fees and third party costs associated with the execution and amendment of this credit facility through the maturity date interest is payable at a maturity rate of libor plus 1250 to 1825 depending on the result of certain ratios defined in the credit agreement verisk and iso are coborrowers under the credit facility borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital and capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchase programs we had borrowings of 5800 million from our credit facility and repaid 5700 million of this balance during the year ended december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had 100 million and 0 respectively outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31 2012 we have an available borrowing capacity of 8400 million under the credit facility 

the credit facility contains certain customary financial and other covenants that among other things impose certain restrictions on indebtedness liens investments and capital expenditures these covenants also place restrictions on mergers asset sales saleleaseback transactions payments between us and our subsidiaries and certain transactions with affiliates the financial covenants require that at the end of any fiscal quarter we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 30 to 10 and that during any period of four fiscal quarters we maintain a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio below 35 to 10 we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the credit facility as of december 31 2012 

we also have longterm private placement loan facilities under uncommitted master shelf agreements with new york life and prudential capital group or prudential as of december 31 2012 we had available capacity under the prudential and new york facilities of 1900 million and 300 million respectively the notes outstanding under these longterm private placement loan facilities mature over the next four years individual borrowings are made at a fixed rate of interest determined at the time of the borrowing and interest is payable quarterly the weighted average rate of interest with respect to our outstanding borrowings under these facilities was 626 and 576 for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively and amounts outstanding were 36 million and 86 million respectively the uncommitted master shelf agreements contain certain covenants that limit our ability to create liens enter into saleleaseback transactions and consolidate merge or sell assets to another company our shelf agreements also contains financial covenants that require that at the end of any fiscal quarter we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 30 to 10 and a leverage ratio below 30 to 10 at the end of any fiscal quarter we were in compliance with all debt covenants under our master shelf agreements as of december 31 2012

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased to 4682 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 3757 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers and the deferral of our fourth quarter 2012 federal tax payment to 2013 as a result of a temporary federal tax relief program related to hurricane sandy this increase was partially offset by an increase in operating expense payments primarily related to the voluntary prefunding of our qualified pension plan in 2012 and interest payments during the year ended december 31 2012 

net cash provided by operating activities increased to 3757 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 3360 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers partially offset by an increase in operating expense and tax payments during the year ended december 31 2011 increased pension contributions of 60 million in 2011 mitigated the growth in our operating cash flow during the year ended december 31 2011

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and intangible assets pension and other post retirement benefits stock based compensation and income taxes actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company’s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers revenue is recognized when persuasive 

  

evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered fees andor price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term usually one year revenues from transactionbased fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

the company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is postcontract customer support or pcs including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis the company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term the pcs associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term the company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include pcs and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term in addition the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 

we invoice our customers in annual quarterly or monthly installments amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met 

stock based compensation 

the fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the use of several estimates including expected term expected riskfree interest rate expected volatility and expected dividend yield 

stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period option grants and restricted stock awards are expensed ratably over the fouryear vesting period we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1 2005 which requires that stock based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 

goodwill and intangibles 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets  this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value 

as of december 31 2012 we had goodwill and net intangible assets of 17684 million which represents 749 of our total assets during fiscal year 2012 we performed an impairment test as of june 30 2012 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary there are many assumptions and estimates used 

  

that directly impact the results of impairment testing including an estimate of future expected revenues earnings and cash flows useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units to mitigate undue influence we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill our valuation has not indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of 12475 million as of december 31 2012 for the year ended december 31 2012 there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets 

pension and postretirement 

on january 12 2012 we announced a hard freeze which will eliminate all future compensation and service credits the freeze was instituted on february 29 2012 to all participants in the pension plans see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  this standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income loss net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard 

certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize quoted rates from longterm bond indices and changes in longterm bond rates over the past year cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees as part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better at the measurement date the output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year’s discount rate and quoted rates for longterm bond indices for our pension plans at december 31 2012 we determined this rate to be 398 a decrease of 100 from the 498 rate used at december 31 2011 our postretirement rate is 275 at december 31 2012 a decrease of 075 from the 350 used at december 31 2011 

the expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader longterm forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation and the current economic environment our investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 4000 debt securities and 6000 equity securities as of december 31 2012 the plan assets were allocated 4100 debt 5790 equity securities and 110 to other investments we have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan the expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through 

  

future net periodic benefit costs we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increase and is no longer applicable in future expense analysis as the pension and post retirement plans were frozen as of february 29 2012 the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 the future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under medicare part d was effectively changed this legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan we are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted as a result we recorded a noncash tax charge to the provision for income taxes of 24 million as of december 31 2010 

a one percent change in discount rate future rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation would have the following effects 

 

 income taxes 

in projecting future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of asc 740  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this interpretation we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position as a result of the implementation of this interpretation we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 103 million which was accounted for as an increase to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings accumulated deficit 

we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

we estimate unrecognized tax positions of 81 million that may be recognized by december 31 2013 due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities net of additional uncertain tax positions 

  

as of december 31 2012 we have gross federal state and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of 1205 million which will expire at various dates from 2013 through 2032 such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2012 deferred tax liabilities in the amount of 408 million and 402 million were recorded in connection with the acquisitions of mediconnect and argus respectively other increases in deferred tax liabilities in 2012 of 567 million were primarily due to increased contributions to the pension and postretirement plans in the current period as well as the other timing differences attributable to depreciation and amortization

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2012 we had borrowings outstanding under our syndicated revolving credit facility of 100 million which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1250 to 1875 depending on certain ratios defined in the credit facility a change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts our pretax income and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instruments based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2012 a one percent change in interest rates would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of 01 million based on our current level of borrowings

we help those businesses address what we believe are the four primary decision making processes essential for managing risk as set forth below in the verisk risk analysis framework 

the verisk risk analysis framework 

 

these four processes correspond to various functional areas inside our customers’ operations 

 

  

  

  

 we add value by linking our solutions across these four key processes for example we use the same modeling methods to support the pricing of homeowner’s insurance policies and to quantify the actual losses when damage occurs to insured homes 

we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or longterm agreements which are typically prepaid and represented approximately 690 of our revenues in 2011 for the year ended december 31 2011 we had revenues of 13318 million and net income of 2828 million for the five year period ended december 31 2011 our revenues and net income grew at a cagr of 135 and 171 respectively 

our history 

we trace our history to 1971 when insurance services office inc or iso started operations as a notforprofit advisory and rating organization providing services for the us pc insurance industry iso was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators as required by law iso’s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development underwriting and rating functions today those businesses form the core of our risk assessment segment 

over the past decade we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets through our decision analytics segment 

our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the american insurance services group or aisg and certain operations and assets of the national insurance crime bureau in 1997 and 1998 respectively those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud to further expand our decision analytics segment we acquired air worldwide or air in 2002 the technological leader in catastrophe modeling in 2004 we entered the healthcare space by 

  

acquiring several businesses that now offer webbased analytical and reporting systems for health insurers provider organizations and selfinsured employers in 2005 we entered the mortgage sector acquiring the first of several businesses that now provide automated fraud detection compliance and decision support solutions for the us mortgage industry in 2006 to bolster our position in the insurance claims field we acquired xactware a leading supplier of estimating software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction in 2010 we acquired 3e company creating a scale presence in supply chain and environmental health and safety in 2011 we further bolstered our healthcare solutions by acquiring health risk partners llc or hrp which provides solutions to optimize revenue which ensure compliance and improve quality of care for medicare advantage and medicaid health plans and bloodhound technologies inc or bloodhound which provides realtime preadjudication medical claims editing 

these acquisitions have added scale geographic reach highly skilled workforces and a wide array of new capabilities to our decision analytics segment they have helped to make us a leading provider of information and decision analytics for customers involved in the business of risk in the us and selectively around the world 

our senior management operating team which includes our chief executive officer chief financial officer chief operating officer general counsel and three senior officers who lead our business units have been with us for an average of over twenty years this team has led our transformation to a successful forprofit entity focused on growth with our us pc insurer customers and expansion into a variety of new markets 

on may 23 2008 in contemplation of our initial public offering or ipo iso formed verisk analytics inc or verisk a delaware corporation to be the holding company for our business verisk was initially formed as a whollyowned subsidiary of iso on october 6 2009 in connection with our ipo the company effected a reorganization whereby iso became a whollyowned subsidiary of verisk verisk class a common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on october 7 2009 under the symbol “vrsk” 

segments 

we organize our business in two segments risk assessment and decision analytics see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii of this annual report for information regarding our segments 

risk assessment segment 

our risk assessment segment serves our pc insurance customers and focuses on the first two decision making processes in our risk analysis framework prediction of loss and selection and pricing of risk within this segment we also provide solutions to help our insurance customers comply with their reporting requirements in each us state in which they operate our customers include most of the pc insurance providers in the us

decision analytics segment 

in the decision analytics segment we support all four phases of our risk analysis framework we develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better predict loss select and price risk detect fraud before and after a loss event and quantify losses effective december 31 2011 we provided additional disclosure about our revenue within decision analytics segment based on the industry vertical groupings of insurance mortgage and financial services healthcare and specialized markets previously we disclosed revenue based on the classification of our solution as fraud identification and detection solutions loss prediction solutions and loss quantification solutions we believe that this change enhances financial reporting transparency and helps investors better understand the themes within the decision analytics segment the businesses are categorized by the primary end market for their services 

 

as we develop our models to quantify loss and detect fraud we improve our ability to predict the loss and prevent the fraud from happening we believe this provides us with a significant competitive advantage over firms that do not offer solutions which operate both before and after loss events 

insurance 

fraud detection and prevention we are a leading provider of frauddetection tools for the pc insurance industry our fraud solutions improve our customers’ profitability by both predicting the likelihood that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred when a claim is submitted our system searches our database and returns information about other claims filed by the same individuals or businesses either as claimants or insurers that help our customers determine if fraud has occurred the system searches for matches in identifying information fields such as name address social security number vehicle identification number driver’s license number tax identification number or other parties to the loss our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches information from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim negotiation of a reduced award or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement 

we have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and investigations professionals to process claims and fight fraud claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against insurance fraud the benefits of a single allclaims database include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for information enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious claims and superior information for investigating fraudulent claims suspicious individuals and possible fraud rings our database contains information on nearly 800 million claims and is the world’s largest database of claims information used for claims and investigations insurers and other participants submit new claim reports more than 239000 a day on average across all categories of the us pc insurance industry

immediate action which are critical to stopping fraud and abuse these applications can also detect some organized fraud schemes that are too complex and wellhidden to be identified by other methods 

effective fraud detection relies on pattern identification which in turn requires us to identify isolate and track mortgage applications through time histories of multiple loans both valid and fraudulent are required to compare a submitted loan both to actual data and heuristic analyses for this reason unless fraud detection solutions are fueled by comprehensive data their practicality is limited our proprietary database contains more than 21 million current and historical loan applications collected over the past ten years this database contains data from loan applications as well as supplementary thirdparty data 

our technology employs sophisticated models to identify patterns in the data our solution provides a score which predicts whether the information provided by a mortgage applicant is correct working with data obtained through our partnership with a credit bureau we have demonstrated a strong correlation between fraudulent information in the application and the likelihood of both foreclosure and early payment default on loans we believe our solution is based upon a more comprehensive set of loan level information than any other provider in the mortgage industry 

we also provide forensic audit services for the mortgage origination and mortgage insurance industries our predictive screening tools predict which defaulted loans are the most likely candidates for full audits for the purpose of detecting fraud we then generate detailed audit reports on defaulted mortgage loans those reports serve as a key component of the loss mitigation strategies of mortgage loan insurers the recent turmoil in the mortgage industry has created an opportunity for growth in demand for our services as we believe most mortgage insurers do not have the inhouse capacity to respond to and properly review all of their defaulted loans for evidence of fraud

revenue derived from solutions we provide the us mortgage and mortgagerelated industries accounted for approximately 100 of our total revenue in the year ended december 31 2011 our forensic audits business and business with governmentsponsored entities in the mortgage business accounted for approximately 670 of our total mortgage and mortgagerelated revenue in 2011 because our business relies on transaction volumes based on both new mortgage applications and forensic audit of funded loans reductions in either the volume of mortgage loans originated or the number or quality of funded loans could reduce our revenue mortgage origination volumes in 2011 declined versus 2010 this decline may continue based on changes in the mortgage market related to the us mortgage crisis recently there have been proposals to restructure or eliminate the roles of fannie mae and freddie mac the restructuring or elimination of either fannie mae or freddie mac could have a negative effect on the u s mortgage market and on our revenue derived from the solutions we provide to the mortgage industry if origination volumes and applications for mortgages decline our revenue in this part of the business may decline if we are unable to increase the percentage of mortgages examined for existing customers or add new customers our forensic audit business has benefited from the high amount of bad loans to be examined by mortgage insurers and other parties as a result of the us mortgage crisis certain mortgage insurers who have been operating under regulatory waivers of capital sufficiency requirements have announced that they are currently unable to write new mortgage insurance policies unless regulatory relief is provided such a development could impact the volume of loans to be examined in our forensic audit business and could reduce our revenue and profitability additionally a withdrawal of mortgage insurers from the mortgage loan market could potentially reduce the volume of loan originations which could reduce the revenue in our originationrelated business two customers represented the majority of our mortgage revenue in 2011 and if their volumes decline and we are not able to replace such volumes with new customers our revenue may decline 

there may be consolidation in our end customer market which would reduce the use of our services 

mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon for example in the pc insurance services sector any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions our business could suffer serious harm 

our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions if we are unable to develop new solutions or if we are not successful in introducing andor obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate in addition significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in the past we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions primarily due to difficulties in developing models acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments errors or defects in our solutions that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection of our solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenues diversion of development resources an increase in product liability claims and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims 

we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them our business could be harmed 

our success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights to date we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology this protection of our proprietary technology is limited and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent in addition patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products any disclosure loss invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and ultimately our business our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others including our competitors may use our proprietary technology without our consent furthermore litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could face claims for intellectual property infringement which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers 

there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings particularly in the united states regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry there is a risk that we are infringing or may in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties we monitor thirdparty patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analyses where we deem appropriate however such monitoring and analysis has not been and is unlikely in the future to be comprehensive and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications since the patent application process can take several years to complete there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies as a result we may infringe existing and future thirdparty patents of which we are not aware as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 

thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions even if we prevail litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management’s time and attention 

  

if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop noninfringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

because personal public and nonpublic information is stored in some of our databases we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act grammleachbliley act driver’s privacy protection act health insurance portability and accountability act the european union’s data protection directive and to a lesser extent various other federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace however many consumer advocates privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information particularly social security numbers department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth as a result they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse affect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

  

  

  

 fraudulent data access and other security breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation 

security breaches in our facilities computer networks and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems thirdparty contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information if users gain improper access to our databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify confidential thirdparty information that is stored or transmitted on our networks 

in addition customers’ misuse of our information services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers any such misappropriation andor misuse of our information could result in us among other things being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation 

a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or any other security or privacy breaches may occur and could go undetected the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may lose key business assets including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links the internet or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 

our operations depend on our ability as well as that of thirdparty service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure fire power loss telecommunications failure impacts of terrorism breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers natural disasters or other disasters the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers in addition we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time any damage to our data centers failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements resulting in decreased revenue operating income and earnings per share 

we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively 

some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive and are expected to remain highly competitive we compete on the basis of quality customer service product and service selection and price our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment due to their size certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can as a result these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences emerging technologies and market trends in addition new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments especially against larger competitors we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete if we fail to successfully compete our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

acquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences 

our longterm business strategy includes growth through acquisitions future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses such risks include among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition 

we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities although we have capacity under our uncommitted facilities lenders are not required to loan us any funds under such facilities therefore future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases the demand for some of our solutions may decrease 

public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 

our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of over twenty years 

  

however with the exception of frank j coyne our chairman and chief executive officer we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team if we lose key members of our senior management operating team we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers 

our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees if our attrition rate increases our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work if our business continues to grow the number of people we will need to hire will increase we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs 

we are subject to antitrust and other litigation and may in the future become subject to further such litigation an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

we participate in businesses particularly insurancerelated businesses and services that are subject to substantial litigation including antitrust litigation we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability given the nature of our business we may be subject to similar litigation in the future even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth 

our liquidity financial position and profitability could be adversely affected by further deterioration in us and international credit markets and economic conditions 

deterioration in the global capital markets has caused financial institutions to seek additional capital merge with larger financial institutions and in some cases fail these conditions have led to concerns by market participants about the stability of financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties resulting in a contraction of available credit even for the most creditworthy borrowers due to recent market events our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing may be negatively impacted if one of our lenders under our revolving credit facilities or existing shelf arrangements fails to meet its funding obligations in such an event we may not be able to draw on all or a substantial portion of our uncommitted credit facilities which would adversely affect our liquidity also if we attempt to obtain future financing in addition to or replacement of our existing credit facilities to finance our continued growth through acquisitions or otherwise the credit market turmoil could negatively impact our ability to obtain such financing 

  

general economic political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business 

the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation the united states economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions in addition the decline of the credit markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators and therefore the immediate demand for our related mortgage solutions specifically certain of our fraud detection and prevention solutions are directed at the mortgage market this decline in asset value and originations and an increase in foreclosure levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage originations and securitizations any new regulatory regime may change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our solutions to new regulation 

if there are substantial sales of our common stock our stock price could decline 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive 

as of december 31 2011 our stockholders who owned our shares prior to the ipo and followon offering continue to beneficially own a portion of our class a common stock primarily owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop representing in aggregate approximately 131  of our outstanding common stock such stockholders will be able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration and subject to limitations on the timing amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly in addition the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

pursuant to our equity incentive plans options to purchase approximately 17834361 shares of class a common stock were outstanding as of february 24 2012  we filed a registration statement under the securities act which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans including for such outstanding options as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

also in the future we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 

our capital structure level of indebtedness and the terms of antitakeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested 

  

stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us as a public company we are subject to section 203 which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 150 or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions but we do not intend to do so 

these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future

revenue growth we use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers sales to new customers sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses 

ebitda margin we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth 

revenues 

we earn revenues through subscriptions longterm agreements and on a transactional basis subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year as a result the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period in general we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business our longterm agreements are generally for periods of three to seven years we recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most longterm agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 

certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis for example we have solutions that allow our customers to access fraud detection tools in the context of an individual mortgage application or loan obtain propertyspecific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building or compare a pc insurance medical or workers’ compensation claim with information in our databases for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 311 and 302 of our revenues respectively were derived from providing transactional solutions we earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed in general transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month 

approximately 857 and 840 of the revenues in our risk assessment segment for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions our customers in this segment include most of the pc insurance providers in the united states approximately 566 and 568 of the revenues in our decision analytics segment for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions 

principal operating costs and expenses 

personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses include salaries benefits incentive compensation equity compensation costs described under “equity compensation costs” below sales commissions employment taxes recruiting costs and outsourced temporary agency costs which represented 653 and 654 of our total expenses for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

we allocate personnel expenses between two categories cost of revenues and selling general and administrative costs based on the actual costs associated with each employee we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues and all other personnel including executive managers sales people 

  

marketing business development finance legal human resources and administrative services as selling general and administrative expenses a significant portion of our other operating costs such as facilities and communications are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed 

while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues historically our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses 

cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our nextgeneration solutions our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization 

selling general and administrative expense our selling general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities insurance and communications are also allocated to selling general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee our selling general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization

equity compensation costs 

we have a leveraged esop funded with intercompany debt that includes 401k esop and profit sharing components to provide employees with equity participation we make quarterly cash contributions to the plan equal to the debt service requirements as the debt is repaid shares are released to the esop to fund 401k matching and profit sharing contributions and the remainder is allocated annually to active employees in proportion to their eligible compensation in relation to total participants’ eligible compensation 

we accrue compensation expense over the reporting period equal to the fair value of the shares to be released to the esop depending on the number of shares released to the plan during the quarter and the fluctuation in the fair value of the shares a corresponding increase or decrease in compensation expense will occur the amount of our equity compensation costs recognized for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 are as follows 

 

   

in connection with our ipo on october 6 2009 we accelerated our future esop allocation contribution through the end of the esop in 2013 to all participants eligible for a contribution in 2009 this resulted in a nonrecurring noncash charge of approximately 577 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result subsequent to the offering the noncash esop allocation expense was substantially reduced excluding the esop allocation expense relating specifically to our 401k and profit sharing plans were 126 million 116 million and 87 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

in addition the portion of the esop allocation expense related to the appreciation of the value of the shares in the esop above the value of those shares when the esop was first established is not tax deductible 

prior to our ipo our class a stock and vested stock options were recorded within redeemable common stock at full redemption value at each balance sheet date as the redemption of these securities was not solely within the control of the company see note 14 of our consolidated financial statements effective with the corporate reorganization that occurred on october 6 2009 we are no longer obligated to redeem class a stock and therefore are not required to present our class a stock and vested stock options at redemption value our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2009 reflect a reversal of the redeemable common stock the reversal of the redeemable common stock of 10649 million on october 6 2009 resulted in the elimination of accumulated deficit of 4406 million an increase of 01 million to class a common stock at par value an increase of 6243 million to additional paidincapital and a reclassification of the iso class a unearned common stock ksop shares balance of 13 million to unearned ksop contribution see note 14 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

by 61 million or 30 this decrease was primarily due to decrease in salaries and employee benefits costs of 31 million a 22 million increase in state employment tax credit office maintenance expense of 11 million and 07 million of other general expenses these decreases were partially offset by an increase in data and consultant costs of 10 million incurred primarily in connection with the revenues from our propertyspecific rating and underwriting information solutions 

the decrease in salaries and employee benefits of 31 million includes 65 million reduction in pension costs and was partially offset by an increase of 34 million in salary and employee benefit costs which include annual salary increases and longterm incentive plans across a relatively constant employee headcount 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses for our risk assessment segment were 790 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 825 million for the year ended december 31 2009 a decrease of 35 million or 43 excluding the impact of the accelerated esop allocation in 2009 of 87 million sga increased 52 million or 70 the increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of 61 million which includes annual salary increases medical costs commissions and longterm incentive plan expense and an increase in other general expenses of 14 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in pension cost of 14 million and decrease in legal costs primarily related to our ipo in 2009 of 09 million 

ebitda margin 

the ebitda margin for our risk assessment segment was 495 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 403 for the year ended december 31 2009 the impact of the accelerated esop allocation of 384 million in 2009 negatively affected our margin by approximately 73 in addition included in our 2009 ebitda margin are costs of 40 million associated with the preparation of our ipo for the year ended december 31 2009 which negatively impacted our margin of 08 for our 2010 ebitda margin decreased pension costs of 79 million positively impacted our margin by approximately 15 

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2011 in management’s opinion the data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and reflects all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of this data the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period 

 

 liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents and availableforsale securities of 1967 million and 606 million respectively subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in 

  

advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year we have historically generated significant cash flows from operations as a result of this factor as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and to fuel our future growth plans 

we have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that as described above we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or longterm contracts which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered when cash is received for prepayment of invoices we record an asset cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability fees received in advance this current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services in most businesses growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows unlike these businesses our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services 

our capital expenditures which include noncash purchases of fixed assets and capital lease obligations as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 were 51 and 36 respectively we estimate our capital expenditures for 2012 will be approximately 750 million which primarily include expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with asc 35040 “ accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use ” we also capitalize amounts in accordance with asc 98520 “ software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed ” 

we have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we repurchased 3807 million 4223 million and redeemed 467 million respectively of our common stock included in the 2010 share repurchases are repurchases of 2098 million of class b including 1999 million and 99 million of verisk class b1 and class b2 respectively which were not a part of the repurchase program a portion of the share redemptions in 2009 included in the total above was completed pursuant to the terms of the insurance service office inc 1996 incentive plan or the option plan 

we provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain qualifying active employees and retirees on january 12 2012 we announced a hard freeze which will eliminate all future compensation and service credits to be instituted on february 29 2012 to all participants in the pension plans based on the pension funding policy we are required to contribute a minimum of approximately 289 million to the pension plans in 2012 in addition we are contemplating a voluntary prefunding to our qualified pension plan of an amount between 700 million and 900 million which may occur in the first half of 2012 under the postretirement plan we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying participants however participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the premium coverage we expect to contribute approximately 34 million to the postretirement plan in 2012 see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

financing and financing capacity 

we had total debt excluding capital lease and other obligations of 10967 million and 8350 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the debt at december 31 2011 is issued under longterm private placement loan facilities and senior notes issued in 2011 to finance our stock repurchases and acquisitions 

on april 6 2011 we completed an issuance of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of 4500 million these senior notes are due on may 1 2021 and accrue interest at a rate of 5800 we received 

  

net proceeds of 4460 million after deducting original issue discount underwriting discount and commissions of 40 million these underwriters’ discounts and commissions will be amortized over the tenyear period which is consistent with the remaining life of the notes interest is payable semiannually on may 1st and november 1st each year beginning on november 1 2011 

on december 8 2011 we completed a second issuance of senior notes in the aggregate principal of 2500 million these senior notes are due on january 15 2019 and accrue interest at a rate of 4875 we received new proceeds of 2460 million after deducting original issue discount underwriting discount and commissions of 40 million these discounts and commissions will be amortized over a sevenyear period which is consistent with the remaining life of the notes interest is payable semiannually on january 15th and july 15th of each year beginning on july 15 2012 

the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by iso and certain subsidiaries that guarantee our syndicated revolving credit facility “credit facility” or any amendment refinancing or replacement thereof  we expect to redraw from our credit facility over time as needed for our corporate strategy including for general corporate purposes and acquisitions the indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things create certain liens enter into saleleaseback transactions and consolidate with sell lease convey or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets or merge with or into any other person or entity 

as of december 31 2011 our 7250 million syndicated revolving credit facility due october 2016 is a committed facility and all of our longterm private placement loan facilities are uncommitted facilities we have financed and expect to finance our shortterm working capital needs stock repurchases and acquisition contingent payments through cash from operations and borrowings from a combination of our credit facility and longterm private placement facilities we had borrowings of 3100 million from our credit facility outstanding as of december 31 2010 on april 8 2011 and december 8 2011 we repaid 2950 million and 1450 million respectively of our outstanding borrowings from the credit facility from proceeds of our senior notes discussed above as of december 31 2011 our credit facility had no outstanding borrowings and 7250 million of borrowing capacity was available 

the credit facility contains certain customary financial and other covenants that among other things impose certain restrictions on indebtedness liens investments and capital expenditures these covenants also place restrictions on mergers asset sales saleleaseback transactions payments between us and our subsidiaries and certain transactions with affiliates the financial covenants require that at the end of any fiscal quarter we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 30 to 10 and that during any period of four fiscal quarters we maintain a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio below 325 to 10 we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the credit facility as of december 31 2011 

our credit facility at december 31 2010 totaled 5750 million and on march 16 2011 the northern trust company joined the credit facility to increase the capacity from 5750 million to 6000 million on march 28 2011 we entered into amendments to our credit facility and our master shelf agreements to among other things permit the issuance of the senior notes and guarantees noted above on october 25 2011 we amended and restated the credit facility to increase the capacity from 6000 million to 7000 million extended the credit facility through october 24 2016 and named iso and verisk as coborrowers the amended credit agreement also resulted in a decrease in the applicable interest rates the interest rates for borrowing under the amended credit agreement will now be the applicable libor plus 1250 to 1875 depending upon the result of certain ratios defined in the amended credit agreement on november 14 2011 td bank joined the credit facility to increase the capacity from 7000 million to 7250 million we paid a onetime commitment fee which will be amortized over a five year period which is consistent with the remaining life of the credit facility 

we also have longterm private placement loan facilities under uncommitted master shelf agreements with new york life and prudential capital group or prudential on june 13 2011 we repaid our 500 million 

  

prudential series e notes on august 8 2011 we repaid our 250 million prudential series f notes and 500 million principal series a notes as of december 31 2011 we had available capacity of 300 million and 1900 million with new york life and prudential respectively the master shelf agreement with aviva investors north america expired on december 10 2011 and we did not extend the agreement 

the notes outstanding under these longterm private placement loan facilities mature over the next five years individual borrowings are made at a fixed rate of interest determined at the time of the borrowing and interest is payable quarterly the weighted average rate of interest with respect to our outstanding borrowings under these facilities was 576 and 607 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and amounts outstanding were 86 and 46 million respectively the uncommitted master shelf agreements contain certain covenants that limit our ability to create liens enter into saleleaseback transactions and consolidate merge or sell assets to another company our shelf agreements also contains financial covenants that require that at the end of any fiscal quarter we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 30 to 10 and a leverage ratio below 30 to 10 at the end of any fiscal quarter we were in compliance with all debt covenants under our master shelf agreements as of december 31 2011

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased to 3757 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 3360 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers partially offset by an increase in operating expense and tax payments during the year ended december 31 2011 increased pension contributions of 60 million in 2011 mitigated the growth in our operating cash flow during the year ended december 31 2011

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2011 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 

 

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 

  

generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and intangible assets pension and other post retirement benefits stock based compensation and income taxes actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company’s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered fees andor price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term usually one year revenues from transactionbased fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

the company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is postcontract customer support or pcs including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis the company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term the pcs associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term the company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include pcs and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term in addition the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 

we invoice our customers in annual quarterly or monthly installments amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met 

stock based compensation 

the fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the use of several estimates including expected term expected riskfree interest rate expected volatility and expected dividend yield 

stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period option grants and restricted stock awards are expensed ratably over the fouryear vesting period we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1 2005 which requires that stock based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 

prior to our ipo the fair value of the common stock underlying the stock based compensation was determined quarterly on or about the final day of the quarter the valuation methodology was based on a variety 

  

of qualitative and quantitative factors including the nature of the business and history of the enterprise the economic outlook in general the condition of the specific industries in which we operate the financial condition of the business our ability to generate free cash flow and goodwill or other intangible asset value 

prior to our ipo the fair value of our common stock was determined using generally accepted valuation methodologies including the use of the guideline company method this determination of fair market value employs both a comparable company analysis which examines the valuation multiples of public companies deemed comparable in whole or in part to us and a discounted cash flow analysis that determines a present value of the projected future cash flows of the business the comparable companies are comprised of a combination of public companies in the financial services information and technology businesses these methodologies have been consistently applied since 1997 we regularly assess the underlying assumptions used in the valuation methodologies including the comparable companies to be used in the analysis the future forecasts of revenue and earnings and the impact of market conditions on factors such as the weighted average cost of capital these assumptions are reviewed quarterly with a more comprehensive evaluation performed annually for the comparable company analysis the share price and financial performance of these comparables were updated quarterly based on the most recent public information our stock price was also impacted by the number of shares outstanding as the number of shares outstanding has declined over time our share price has increased the determination of the fair value of our common stock required us to make judgments that were complex and inherently subjective if different assumptions are used in future periods stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 

goodwill and intangibles 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets  this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value 

as of december 31 2011 we had goodwill and net intangible assets of 9364 million which represents 608 of our total assets during fiscal year 2011 we performed an impairment test as of june 30 2011 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing including an estimate of future expected revenues earnings and cash flows useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units to mitigate undue influence we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill our valuation has not indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of 7099 million as of december 31 2011 for the year ended december 31 2011 there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets 

pension and postretirement 

we account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  this standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other 

  

comprehensive incomeloss net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard 

certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize quoted rates from longterm bond indices and changes in longterm bond rates over the past year cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees as part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better at the measurement date the output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year’s discount rate and quoted rates for longterm bond indices for our pension plans at december 31 2011 we determined this rate to be 498 a decrease of 051 from the 549 rate used at december 31 2010 our postretirement rate is 350 at december 31 2011 a decrease of 050 from the 400 used at december 31 2010 

the expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader longterm forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation and the current economic environment our investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 400 debt securities and 600 equity securities as of december 31 2011 the plan assets were allocated 470 debt 510 equity securities and 20 to other investments we have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan the expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit costs we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 the future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under medicare part d was effectively changed this legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan we are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted as a result we recorded a noncash tax charge to the provision for income taxes of 24 million as of december 31 2010 

on january 12 2012 we announced a hard freeze which will eliminate all future compensation and service credits to be instituted on february 29 2012 to all participants in the pension plans the freeze in 2012 will reduce the unfunded pension liability by approximately 102 million and we will realize a curtailment gain of approximately 07 million 

  

a one percent change in discount rate future rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation would have the following effects 

 

 income taxes 

in projecting future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 

on january 1 2007 we adopted accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of asc 740  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this interpretation we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position as a result of the implementation of this interpretation we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 103 million which was accounted for as an increase to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earningsaccumulated deficit 

we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

as of december 31 2011 we have gross federal state and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of 871 million which will expire at various dates from 2012 through 2031 such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows 

 

 we estimate unrecognized tax positions of 63 million that may be recognized by december 31 2012 due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities net of additional uncertain tax positions

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2011 we had no borrowings outstanding under our syndicated revolving credit facility which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1250 to 1875 depending on certain ratios defined in the credit facility a change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts our pretax income and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instruments based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2011 a one percent change in interest rates would not result in a change in annual pretax interest expense based on our current level of borrowings

we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or longterm agreements which are typically prepaid and represented approximately 700 of our revenues in 2010 for the year ended december 31 2010 we had revenues of 11383 million and net income of 2426 million for the five year period ended december 31 2010 our revenues and net income grew at a compound annual growth rate or cagr of 117 and 149 respectively 

 

our history 

 

we trace our history to 1971 when insurance services office inc or iso started operations as a notforprofit advisory and rating organization providing services for the us pc insurance industry iso was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators as required by law iso’s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development underwriting and rating functions today those businesses form the core of our risk assessment segment 

 

over the past decade we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets through our decision analytics segment 

 

our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the american insurance services group or aisg and certain operations and assets of the national insurance crime bureau in 1997 and 1998 respectively those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud to further expand our decision analytics segment we acquired air worldwide or air in 2002 the technological leader in catastrophe modeling in 2004 we entered the healthcare space by acquiring several businesses that now offer webbased analytical and reporting systems for health insurers provider organizations and selfinsured employers in 2005 we entered the mortgage sector acquiring the first of several businesses that now provide automated fraud detection 

compliance and decision support solutions for the us mortgage industry in 2006 to bolster our position in the claims field we acquired xactware a leading supplier of estimating software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction in 2010 we acquired 3e company creating a scale presence in supply chain and environmental health and safety 

 

these acquisitions have added scale geographic reach highly skilled workforces and a wide array of new capabilities to our decision analytics segment they have helped to make us a leading provider of information and decision analytics for customers involved in the business of risk in the us and selectively around the world 

 

our senior management operating team which includes our chief executive officer chief financial officer chief operating officer general counsel and three senior officers who lead our business units have been with us for an average of almost twenty years this team has led our transformation to a successful forprofit entity focused on growth with our us pc insurer customers and expansion into a variety of new markets 

 

on may 23 2008 in contemplation of our initial public offering or ipo iso formed verisk analytics inc or verisk a delaware corporation to be the holding company for our business verisk was initially formed as a whollyowned subsidiary of iso on october 6 2009 in connection with our ipo the company effected a reorganization whereby iso became a whollyowned subsidiary of verisk verisk class a common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on october 7 2009 under the symbol “vrsk” 

 

segments 

 

we organize our business in two segments risk assessment and decision analytics 

 

risk assessment segment 

 

our risk assessment segment serves our pc insurance customers and focuses on the first two decision making processes in our risk analysis framework loss prediction and selection and pricing of risk within this segment we also provide solutions to help our insurance customers comply with their reporting requirements in each us state in which they operate our customers include most of the pc insurance providers in the us 

 

industrystandard insurance programs 

 

we are the recognized leader in the us for industrystandard insurance programs that help pc insurers define coverages and issue policies our policy language prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language rules and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements insurers must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law to meet their needs we process and interface with state regulators on average over 4000 filings each year ensuring smooth implementation of our rules and forms when insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs our industrystandard insurance programs also help regulators make sure that such insurers’ policies meet basic coverage requirements 

 

standardized coverage language which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants as a result our industrystandard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known our policy language includes standard coverage language endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they are offering with these policy programs insurers also benefit from economies of scale we have over 200 specialized lawyers and insurance experts reviewing changes in each state’s insurance rules and regulations including on average over 11200 legislative bills 

1100 regulatory actions and 2000 court cases per year to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information 

 

to cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace we offer a broad range of policy programs for example in the homeowner’s line of insurance we maintain policy language and rules for six basic coverages 178 national endorsements and 495 statespecific endorsements overall we provide policy language prospective loss costs policy writing rules and a variety of other solutions for 25 lines of insurance 

 

propertyspecific rating and underwriting information 

 

we gather information on individual properties and communities so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price personal and commercial property insurance as well as commercial liability insurance our propertyspecific rating and underwriting information allow our customers to understand quantify underwrite mitigate and avoid potential loss for residential and commercial properties our database contains loss costs and other vital information on approximately 30 million commercial buildings in the united states and also holds information on approximately 58 million individual businesses occupying those buildings we have a staff of approximately 600 field representatives strategically located around the united states who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties evaluate community fireprotection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal buildingcode enforcement each year our field staff visits over 350000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes 

 

we also provide proprietary analytic measures of the ability of individual communities to mitigate losses from important perils nearly every property insurer in the us uses our evaluations of community firefighting capabilities to help determine premiums for fire insurance throughout the country we provide fieldverified and validated data on the fire protection services for more than 46000 fire response jurisdictions we also offer services to evaluate the effectiveness of community enforcement of building codes and the efforts of communities to mitigate damage from flooding further we provide information on the insurance rating territories premium taxes crime risk and hazards of windstorm earthquake wildfire and other perils to supplement our data on specific commercial properties and individual communities we have assembled from a variety of internal and thirdparty sources information on hazards related to geographic locations representing every postal address in the us insurers use this information not only for policy quoting but also for analyzing risk concentration in geographical areas 

 

statistical agent and data services 

 

the pc insurance industry is heavily regulated in the us pc insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate our statistical agent services have enabled pc insurers to meet these regulatory requirements for over 30 years we aggregate the data and as a licensed “statistical agent” in all 50 states puerto rico and the district of columbia we report these statistics to insurance regulators we are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the us pc insurance industry 

 

to provide our customers and the regulators the information they require we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world over the past four decades we have developed core expertise in acquiring processing managing and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our risk assessment segment we use our proprietary technology to assemble organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers we supplement this data with publicly available information 

 

each year pc insurers send us approximately 28 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred we maintain a database of over 158 billion statistical records including approximately 59 billion commercial lines records and approximately 99 billion personal lines records we collect unittransaction detail of each premium and loss record which enhances the validity reliability and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial analyses our proprietary quality process includes almost 2500 separate checks to ensure that data meet our high standards of quality 

actuarial services 

 

we provide actuarial services to help our customers price their risks as they underwrite we project future losses and loss expenses utilizing a broad set of data these projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used solely their own data we provide loss costs by coverage class territory and many other categories our customers can use our estimates of future loss costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies for most pc insurers in most lines of business we believe our loss costs are an essential input to rating decisions we make a number of actuarial adjustments including loss development and loss adjustment expenses before the data is used to estimate future loss costs our actuarial services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industrystandard insurance programs described below 

 

using our large database of premium and loss data our actuaries are able to perform sophisticated analyses using our predictive models and analytic methods to help our pc insurance customers with pricing loss reserving and marketing we distribute a number of actuarial products and offer flexible services to meet our customers’ needs in addition our actuarial consultants provide customized services for our clients that include assisting them with the development of independent insurance programs analysis of their own underwriting experience development of classification systems and rating plans and a wide variety of other business decisions we also supply information to a wide variety of customers in other markets including reinsurance government agencies and real estate 

 

decision analytics segment 

 

in the decision analytics segment we support all four phases of our risk analysis framework we develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better predict loss select and price risk detect fraud before and after a loss event and quantify losses 

 

 

as we develop our models to quantify loss and detect fraud we improve our ability to predict the loss and prevent the fraud from happening we believe this provides us with a significant competitive advantage over firms that do not offer solutions which operate both before and after loss events 

 

fraud identification and detection solutions 

 

pc insurance 

 

we are a leading provider of frauddetection tools for the pc insurance industry our fraud solutions improve our customers’ profitability by both predicting the likelihood that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred when a claim is submitted our system searches our database and returns information about other claims filed by the same individuals or businesses either as 

claimants or insurers that help our customers determine if fraud has occurred the system searches for matches in identifying information fields such as name address social security number vehicle identification number driver’s license number tax identification number or other parties to the loss our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches information from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim negotiation of a reduced award or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement 

 

we have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and investigations professionals to process claims and fight fraud claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against insurance fraud the benefits of a single allclaims database include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for information enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious claims and superior information for investigating fraudulent claims suspicious individuals and possible fraud rings our database contains information on more than 700 million claims and is the world’s largest database of claims information insurers and other participants submit new claim reports more than 239000 a day on average across all categories of the us pc insurance industry 

 

we also provide a service allowing insurers to report thefts of automobiles and property improving the chances of recovering those items a service that helps owners and insurers recover stolen heavy construction and agricultural equipment an expert scoring system that helps distinguish between suspicious and meritorious claims and products that use linkanalysis technology to help visualize and fight insurance fraud 

 

mortgage 

 

we are a leading provider of automated fraud detection compliance and decisionsupport tools for the mortgage industry utilizing our own loan level application database combined with actual mortgage loan performance data we have established a risk scoring system which increases our customers’ ability to detect fraud we provide solutions that detect fraud through each step of the mortgage lifecycle and provide regulatory compliance solutions that perform instant compliance reviews of each mortgage application our fraud solutions can improve our customers’ profitability by predicting the likelihood that a customer account is experiencing fraud our solution analyzes customer transactions in real time and generates recommendations for immediate action which are critical to stopping fraud and abuse these applications can also detect some organized fraud schemes that are too complex and wellhidden to be identified by other methods 

 

effective fraud detection relies on pattern identification which in turn requires us to identify isolate and track mortgage applications through time histories of multiple loans both valid and fraudulent are required to compare a submitted loan both to actual data and heuristic analyses for this reason unless fraud detection solutions are fueled by comprehensive data their practicality is limited our proprietary database contains more than 18 million current and historical loan applications collected over the past ten years this database contains data from loan applications as well as supplementary thirdparty data 

 

our technology employs sophisticated models to identify patterns in the data our solution provides a score which predicts whether the information provided by a mortgage applicant is correct working with data obtained through our partnership with a credit bureau we have demonstrated a strong correlation between fraudulent information in the application and the likelihood of both foreclosure and early payment default on loans we believe our solution is based upon a more comprehensive set of loan level information than any other provider in the mortgage industry 

 

we also provide forensic audit services for the mortgage origination and mortgage insurance industries our predictive screening tools predict which defaulted loans are the most likely candidates for full audits for the purpose of detecting fraud we then generate detailed audit reports on defaulted mortgage loans those reports serve as a key component of the loss mitigation strategies of mortgage loan insurers the recent turmoil in the mortgage industry has created an opportunity for growth in demand for our services as we believe most mortgage insurers do not have the inhouse capacity to respond to and properly review all of their defaulted loans for evidence of fraud 

healthcare 

 

we offer solutions that help healthcare claims payors detect fraud abuse and overpayment our approach combines computerbased modeling and profiling of claims with analysis performed by clinical experts we run our customers’ claims through our proprietary analytic system to identify potential fraud abuse and overpayment and then a registered nurse physician or other clinical specialist skilled in coding and reimbursement decisions reviews all suspect claims and billing patterns this combination of system and human review is unique in the industry and we believe offers improved accuracy for paying claims 

 

we analyze the patterns of claims produced by individual physicians physicians’ practices hospitals dentists and pharmacies to locate the sources of fraud after a suspicious source of claims is identified our realtime analytic solutions investigate each claim individually for particular violations including upcoding multiple billings services claimed but not rendered and billing by unlicensed providers by finding the individual claims with the most costrecovery potential and also minimizing the number of falsepositive indications of fraud we enable the special investigation units of healthcare payors to efficiently control their claims costs while maintaining high levels of customer service to their insurers 

 

we also offer webbased reporting tools that let payors take definitive action to prevent overpayments or payment of fraudulent claims the tools provide the documentation that helps to identify investigate and prevent abusive and fraudulent activity by providers

risk assessment competitors 

 

our risk assessment segment operates primarily in the us pc insurance industry where we enjoy a leading market presence we have a number of competitors in specific lines or services 

we encounter competition from a number of sources including insurers who develop internal technology and actuarial methods for proprietary insurance programs competitors also include other statistical agents including the national independent statistical service the independent statistical service and other advisory organizations providing underwriting rules prospective loss costs and coverage language such as the american association of insurance services and mutual services organization although we believe none of our competitors has the breadth or depth of data we have 

 

competitors for our propertyspecific rating and underwriting information are primarily limited to a number of regional providers of commercial property inspections and surveys including overland solutions inc and regional reporting inc we also compete with a variety of organizations that offer consulting services primarily specialty technology and consulting firms in addition a customer may use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm for these services our competitors also include information technology product and services vendors including cds inc management and strategy consulting firms including deloitte consulting llp and smaller specialized information technology firms and analytical services firms including pinnacle consulting and emb

sales marketing and customer support 

 

we sell our products and services primarily through direct interaction with our clients we employ a threetier sales structure that includes salespeople product specialists and sales support as of december 31 2010 we had a sales force of 268 people within the company several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services these specialized sales teams sell specific highly technical product sets to targeted markets 

 

to provide account management to our largest customers we segment the insurance carrier market into three groups tier one or “national” accounts constitutes our largest customers tier two or “strategic” accounts represents both larger carrier groups and middlemarket carriers tier three are the small insurance companies that may represent one line of business andor regional writers for a few states a sales generalist is assigned to every insurer account and is responsible for our overall relationship with these insurance companies our senior executives are also involved with the senior management of our customers 

 

salespeople participate in both customerservice and sales activities they provide direct support interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a positive experience using our services salespeople primarily seek out new sales opportunities and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activity and provide the best solutions for our customers we believe our salespeople’s product knowledge and local presence differentiates us from our competition product specialists are subjectmatter experts and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products both salespeople and product specialists have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities a team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination between the two groups

intellectual property 

 

we own a significant number of intellectual property rights including copyrights trademarks trade secrets and patents specifically our policy language insurance manuals software and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue we also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the us and foreign countries including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines many of which are registered we believe many of our trademarks trade names service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them we consider our intellectual property to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of statutory eg copyright trademark trade secret and patent and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect them wherever they are used 

 

we also own several software method and processing patents and have several pending patent applications in the us that complement our products the patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to technology including a patent for our claims outcome advisor software and for our xactware sketch product we believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and which are material to our business

regulation 

 

because our business involves the distribution of certain personal public and nonpublic data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility service and marketing decisions based on such data certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws in the united states and to a lesser extent foreign countries examples of such regulation include the fair credit reporting act which regulates the use of consumer credit report information the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of nonpublic personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions the health insurance portability and accountability act which restricts the public disclosure of patient information and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to healthcare businesses the drivers privacy protection act which prohibits the public disclosure use or resale by any state’s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record except for a “permissible purpose” and various other federal state and local laws and regulations 

 

these laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used to challenge the accuracy of such information andor to prevent the use and disclosure of such information in certain instances these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances 

 

we are also licensed as a rating rate service advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all fifty states puerto rico guam the virgin islands and the district of columbia as such an advisory organization we provide statistical actuarial policy language development and related products and services to propertycasualty insurers including advisory prospective loss costs other prospective cost information manual rules and policy language we also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policywriting and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to invest in shares of our class a common stock if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer in such case the trading price of our class a common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

 

we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions 

 

we depend upon data from external sources including data received from customers and various government and public record services for information used in our databases in general we do not own the information in these databases and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons and we could also become subject to legislative or judicial restrictions on the use of such data in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use andor process the data in addition some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company specifically all of our outstanding class b common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers and provide us with a significant percentage of our data if our customers’ percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms if a substantial number of data sources or certain key sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

 

agreements with our data suppliers are shortterm agreements some suppliers are also competitors which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors an advantage such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources 

 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from us pc primary insurers if the downturn in the us insurance industry continues or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions our revenues will decline 

 

revenues derived from solutions we provide to us pc primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 57 of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to us pc primary insurers also sales of certain of our solutions are tied to premiums in the us pc insurance market which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control in addition our 

revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by pc primary insurers include the following 

 

  

a continued downturn in the insurance industry or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

our revenue from customers in the mortgage vertical is largely transactional and subject to changing conditions of the us mortgage market 

 

revenue derived from solutions we provide the us mortgage and mortgagerelated industries accounted for approximately 13 of our total revenue in the year ended december 31 2010 our forensic audit business and business with governmentsponsored entities in the mortgage business accounted for approximately 65 of our total mortgage and mortgagerelated revenue in 2010 because our business relies on transaction volumes based on both new mortgage applications and forensic audit of funded loans reductions in either the volume of mortgage loans originated or the number or quality of funded loans could reduce our revenue mortgage origination volumes in 2010 declined versus 2009 and may continue to decline based on the changes in the mortgage market related to the us mortgage crisis 

 

recently there have been proposals to restructure or eliminate the roles of fannie mae and freddie mac the restructuring or elimination of either fannie mae or freddie mac could have a negative effect on the u s mortgage market and on our revenue derived from the solutions we provide to the mortgage industry if origination volumes and applications for mortgages decline our revenue in this part of the business may decline if we are unable to increase the percentage of mortgages examined for existing customers or add new customers our forensic audit business has benefited from the high amount of bad loans to be examined by mortgage insurers and other parties as a result of the us mortgage crisis two customers represent the majority of our mortgage revenue in 2010 and if their volumes decline and we are not able to replace them with new customers our revenue may decline 

 

there may be consolidation in our end customer market which would reduce the use of our services 

 

mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon for example in the pc insurance services sector any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

 

if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions our business could suffer serious harm 

 

our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions if we are unable to develop new solutions or if we are not successful in introducing andor obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly 

than we anticipate in addition significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in the past we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions primarily due to difficulties in developing models acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments errors or defects in our solutions that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection of our solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenues diversion of development resources an increase in product liability claims and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims 

 

we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them our business could be harmed 

 

our success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights to date we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology this protection of our proprietary technology is limited and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent in addition patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products any disclosure loss invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and ultimately our business our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others including our competitors may use our proprietary technology without our consent furthermore litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we could face claims for intellectual property infringement which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers 

 

there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings particularly in the united states regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry there is a risk that we are infringing or may in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties we monitor thirdparty patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate however such monitoring and analysis has not been and is unlikely in the future to be comprehensive and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications since the patent application process can take several years to complete there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies as a result we may infringe existing and future thirdparty patents of which we are not aware as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 

 

thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions even if we prevail litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management’s time and attention 

 

if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop noninfringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

 

regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

 

because personal public and nonpublic information is stored in some of our databases we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act grammleachbliley act driver’s privacy protection act health insurance portability and accountability act the 

european union’s data protection directive and to a lesser extent various other federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace however many consumer advocates privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information particularly social security numbers department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth as a result they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse affect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

  

fraudulent data access and other security breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation 

 

security breaches in our facilities computer networks and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems thirdparty contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information if users gain improper access to our databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify confidential thirdparty information that is stored or transmitted on our networks 

 

in addition customers’ misuse of our information services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers any such misappropriation andor misuse of our information could result in us among other things being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation 

 

a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways 

 

  

we may detect incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 

 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we may lose key business assets including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links the internet or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 

 

our operations depend on our ability as well as that of thirdparty service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure fire power loss telecommunications failure impacts of terrorism breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers natural disasters or other disasters the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers in addition we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time any damage to our data centers failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements resulting in decreased revenue operating income and earnings per share 

 

we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively 

 

some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive and are expected to remain highly competitive we compete on the basis of quality customer service product and service selection and price our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment due to their size certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can as a result these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences emerging technologies and market trends in addition new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments especially against larger competitors we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete if we fail to successfully compete our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

acquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences 

 

our longterm business strategy includes growth through acquisitions future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses such risks include among other things 

 

 20 

 

  

the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition 

 

we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities although we have capacity under our uncommitted facilities lenders are not required to loan us any funds under such facilities therefore future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

 

to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases the demand for some of our solutions may decrease 

 

public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 

 

our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of almost twenty years however with the exception of frank j coyne our chairman and chief executive officer we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team if we lose key members of our senior management operating team we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers 

 

our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees if our attrition rate increases our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and 

financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work if our business continues to grow the number of people we will need to hire will increase we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs 

 

we are subject to antitrust and other litigation and may in the future become subject to further such litigation an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

 

we participate in businesses particularly insurancerelated businesses and services that are subject to substantial litigation including antitrust litigation we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability given the nature of our business we may be subject to similar litigation in the future even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth 

 

our liquidity financial position and profitability could be adversely affected by further deterioration in us and international credit markets and economic conditions 

 

deterioration in the global capital markets has caused financial institutions to seek additional capital merge with larger financial institutions and in some cases fail these conditions have led to concerns by market participants about the stability of financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties resulting in a contraction of available credit even for the most creditworthy borrowers due to recent market events our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing may be negatively impacted if one of our lenders under our revolving credit facilities or existing shelf arrangements fails to meet its funding obligations in such an event we may not be able to draw on all or a substantial portion of our uncommitted credit facilities which would adversely affect our liquidity also if we attempt to obtain future financing in addition to or replacement of our existing credit facilities to finance our continued growth through acquisitions or otherwise the credit market turmoil could negatively impact our ability to obtain such financing 

 

general economic political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business 

 

the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation the united states economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions in addition the decline of the credit markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators and therefore the immediate demand for our related mortgage solutions specifically certain of our fraud identification and detection solutions are directed at the mortgage market this decline in asset value and originations and an increase in foreclosure 

levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage originations and securitizations any new regulatory regime may change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our solutions to new regulation 

 

if there are substantial sales of our common stock our stock price could decline 

 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive 

 

as of december 31 2010 our stockholders who owned our shares prior to the ipo and followon offering continue to beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 24577690 shares of our class a common stock primarily owned by our esop 12225480 shares of our class b series 1 or class b1 common stock and 14771340 shares of our class b series 2 or class b2 common stock representing in aggregate approximately 3033 of our outstanding common stock such stockholders will be able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration and subject to limitations on the timing amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly in addition the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

certain members of our management are subject to lockup agreements with us whereby they are not be permitted to sell any of their common stock subject to certain conditions for a period of time restrictions under these lockup agreements expire in part on april 6 2011 and expire completely on october 6 2011 also pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our class b stockholders are not able to sell any of their common stock subject to certain conditions to the public for a period of time each share of class b1 common stock shall convert automatically without any action by the holder into one share of class a common stock on april 6 2011 each share of class b2 common stock shall convert automatically without any action by the holder into one share of class a common stock on october 6 2011 

 

our board of directors may approve exceptions to the limitation on transfers of our class b common stock in their sole discretion in connection with the sale of such class b common stock in a public offering registered with the securities and exchange commission or in such other limited circumstances as our board of directors may determine any class b common stock sold to the public will first be converted to class a common stock such further resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

 

pursuant to our equity incentive plans options to purchase approximately 23018745 shares of class a common stock were outstanding as of february 25 2011 we filed a registration statement under the securities act which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans including for such outstanding options as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

 

also in the future we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 

 

the holders of our class b common stock have the right to elect up to three out of eleven of our directors and their interests in our business may be different than yours 

 

until no class b common stock remains outstanding the holders of our class b common stock will have the right to elect up to three of our directors stockholders of the class b common stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable for the holders of class a common 

stock or their interests may otherwise conflict with those of class a stockholders for example holders of our class b common stock may seek to cause us to take courses of action that in their judgment could enhance their investment in us or the use of our solutions but which might involve risks to holders of our class a common stock including a potential decrease in the price of our class a common stock 

 

our capital structure level of indebtedness and the terms of antitakeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors 

 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 

  

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us as a public company we are subject to section 203 which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 150 or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions but we do not intend to do so 

 

these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future

we are party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business including those matters described below we are unable at the present time to determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they may have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows this is primarily because many of these cases remain in their early stages and only limited discovery has taken place although we believe we have strong defenses and intend to vigorously defend the litigation proceedings described below we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

claims outcome advisor litigation 

 

hensley et al v computer sciences corporation et al was a putative nationwide class action complaint filed in february 2005 in miller county arkansas state court defendants include numerous insurance companies and providers of software products used by insurers in paying claims we are among the named defendants plaintiffs allege that certain software products including our claims outcome advisor product and a competing software product sold by computer sciences corporation improperly estimated the amount to be paid by insurers to their policyholders in connection with claims for bodily injuries

resolve the dispute in mediation hanover served a summons and complaint seeking indemnity and contribution from us at this time it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of or estimate the liability related to this matter

executive summary 

 

key performance metrics 

 

we believe our business’s ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy we use year over year revenue growth and ebitda margin as metrics to measure our performance ebitda and ebitda margin are nongaap financial measures see note 4 within item 6 selected financial data included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

revenue growth we use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers sales to new customers sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses 

 

ebitda margin we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth 

 

revenues 

 

we earn revenues through subscriptions longterm agreements and on a transactional basis subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year as a result the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language our claims fraud solution or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period in general we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business our longterm agreements are generally for periods of three to seven years we recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most longterm agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 

 

certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis for example we have solutions that allow our customers to access fraud detection tools in the context of an individual mortgage application or loan obtain propertyspecific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building or compare a pc insurance medical or workers’ compensation claim with information in our databases for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 302 and 290 of our revenues respectively were derived from providing transactional solutions we earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed in general transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month 

 

approximately 840 and 838 of the revenues in our risk assessment segment for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions our customers in this segment include most of the pc insurance providers in the united states approximately 568 and 577 of the revenues in our decision analytics segment for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions 

principal operating costs and expenses 

 

personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses include salaries benefits incentive compensation equity compensation costs described under “equity compensation costs” below sales commissions employment taxes recruiting costs and outsourced temporary agency costs which represented 654 and 676 of our total expenses for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the higher percentage of personnel expenses in 2009 is primarily related to the accelerated esop allocation that occurred prior to our initial ipo the accelerated esop allocation resulted in a one time noncash charge of 577 million excluding this accelerated esop allocation personnel expenses represented 648 of our total expenses for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

we allocate personnel expenses between two categories cost of revenues and selling general and administrative costs based on the actual costs associated with each employee we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues and all other personnel including executive managers sales people marketing business development finance legal human resources and administrative services as selling general and administrative expenses a significant portion of our other operating costs such as facilities and communications are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed 

 

while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues historically our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses 

 

cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our nextgeneration solutions our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization 

 

selling general and administrative expense our selling general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities insurance and communications are also allocated to selling general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee our selling general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization

equity compensation costs 

 

we have a leveraged esop funded with intercompany debt that includes 401k esop and profit sharing components to provide employees with equity participation we make quarterly cash contributions to the plan equal to the debt service requirements as the debt is repaid shares are released to the esop to fund 401k matching and profit sharing contributions and the remainder is allocated annually to active employees in proportion to their eligible compensation in relation to total participants’ eligible compensation 

 

we accrue compensation expense over the reporting period equal to the fair value of the shares to be released to the esop depending on the number of shares released to the plan during the quarter and the fluctuation in the fair value of the shares a corresponding increase or decrease in compensation expense will 

occur the amount of our equity compensation costs recognized for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 are as follows 

 

 

 

in connection with our ipo on october 6 2009 we accelerated our future esop allocation contribution through the end of the esop in 2013 to all participants eligible for a contribution in 2009 this resulted in a nonrecurring noncash charge of approximately 577 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result subsequent to the offering the noncash esop allocation expense was substantially reduced for future periods excluding the esop allocation expense relating specifically to our 401k and profit sharing plans were 116 million 87 million and 97 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

in addition the portion of the esop allocation expense related to the appreciation of the value of the shares in the esop above the value of those shares when the esop was first established is not tax deductible 

 

prior to our ipo we granted to key employees nonqualified stock options covered under the insurance services office inc 1996 incentive plan or the option plan subsequent to the ipo nonqualified stock options granted to key employees are covered under the verisk analytics inc 2009 equity incentive plan the incentive plan all of the company’s outstanding stock options are covered under the incentive plan or the option plan see stockbased compensation section within our critical accounting policies and estimates and note 16 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

prior to our ipo our class a stock and vested stock options were recorded within redeemable common stock at full redemption value at each balance sheet date as the redemption of these securities was not solely within the control of the company effective with the corporate reorganization that occurred on october 6 2009 we are no longer obligated to redeem class a stock and therefore are not required to present our class a stock and vested stock options at redemption value our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2009 reflect a reversal of the redeemable common stock the reversal of the redeemable common stock of 10649 million on october 6 2009 resulted in the elimination of accumulated deficit of 4406 million an increase of 01 million to class a common stock at par value an increase of 6243 million to additional paidincapital and a reclassification of the iso class a unearned common stock shares balance within the iso 401k savings and employee stock ownership plan or ksop of 13 million to unearned ksop contributions see note 14 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

public company expenses 

 

beginning in 2008 our selling general and administrative costs increased as we prepared for our ipo these costs were 70 million and 65 million for the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 and negatively affected our ebitda margins by 07 for each of the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 following our ipo we incurred additional selling general and administrative expenses related to operating as a public company such as increased legal and accounting expenses the cost of an investor relations function 

costs related to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and increased director and officer insurance premiums

quarterly results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2010 in management’s opinion the data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and reflects all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of this data the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period 

 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents and availableforsale securities of 606 million and 770 million respectively subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year we have historically generated significant cash flows from operations as a result of this factor as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs including acquisition contingent payments and to fuel our future growth plans 

 

we have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that as described above we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or longterm contracts which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered when cash is received for prepayment of invoices we record an asset cash and cash equivalents on our balance 

sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability fees received in advance this current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services in most businesses growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows unlike these businesses our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services 

 

our capital expenditures which include noncash purchases of fixed assets and capital lease obligations as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were 36 43 and 37 respectively we estimate our capital expenditures for 2011 will be approximately 600 million which primarily include expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with asc 35040 “accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” the amounts capitalized in accordance with asc 98520 “ software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed ” are not significant to the financial statements 

 

we have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we repurchased and redeemed 4223 million 467 million and 3926 million respectively of our common stock included in the 2010 share repurchases are repurchases of 2098 million of class b including 1999 million and 99 million of verisk class b1 and class b2 respectively which were not a part of the repurchase program a substantial portion of the share redemption included in the total above was completed pursuant to the terms of the insurance service office inc 1996 incentive plan or the option plan 

 

we provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain qualifying active employees and retirees based on the pension funding policy we expect to contribute approximately 258 million to the pension plan in 2011 under the postretirement plan we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying participants however participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the premium coverage we expect to contribute approximately 42 million to the postretirement plan in 2011 see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

cash flow 

 

the following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased to 3360 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 3264 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers and a reduction in interest payments partially offset by an increase in operating expense and tax payments during the year ended december 31 2010 increased pension contributions of 150 million in 2010 as well as the timing of certain annual bonus payments mitigated the growth in our operating cash flow during the year ended december 31 2010 

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased to 3264 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 2479 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to an increase in cash receipts of 1415 million a decrease in excess tax benefit from exercised stock options of 61 million a decrease in payments of acquisition related liabilities of 19 million and a decrease in salary and employee related payments of 102 million due to an additional paycycle that occurred in 2008 our payroll is processed on a biweekly basis thereby requiring an additional paycycle once every ten years this increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in operating expense related payments of 636 million an increase in tax payments of 121 million and an increase in interest payments of 52 million 

 

investing activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities was 2437 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and 1853 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in acquisitions including escrow funding of 1366 million partially offset by a decrease in earnout payments of 781 million 

 

net cash used in investing activities was 1853 million for the year ended december 31 2009 and 1305 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to increased cash paid for acquisitions including escrow funding of 485 million and an increase in purchases of fixed assets of 80 million 

 

financing activities 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 1088 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and 1028 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in net cash used in financing activities can be attributed to an increase in share repurchases of 3884 million primarily through our repurchase program and the shares repurchased as part of our followon public offering on october 1 2010 the increase was partially offset by net debt receipts of 3256 million and cash inflows from stock option exercises of 568 million 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 1028 million for the year ended december 31 2009 and 1074 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to a decrease in the repurchases of stock of 3458 million partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt of 3125 million a decrease in proceeds from stock options exercised of 226 million and a decrease in excess tax benefit from stock options exercised of 61 million

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and intangible assets pension and other post retirement benefits stockbased compensation and income taxes actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions 

 

revenue recognition 

 

the company’s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered fees andor price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term usually one year revenues from transactionbased fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

the company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is postcontract customer support or pcs including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis the company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term the company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include pcs and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term in addition the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 

 

we invoice our customers in annual quarterly or monthly installments amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

on january 1 2005 we adopted the new accounting standard for share based payment using a prospective approach which required us to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption based on the grant date fair value as the majority of annual grants have a four year vesting term the compensation expense for 2005 through 2007 is not comparable in subsequent periods as there is no compensation expense recorded for the vesting of awards granted from 2002 through 2004 the following table illustrates the amount of annual compensation expense resulting from the implementation of this standard using the prospective approach for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

the fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the use of several estimates including expected term expected riskfree interest rate expected volatility and expected dividend yield 

 

stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period option grants are expensed ratably over the fouryear vesting period we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1 2005 which requires that stockbased compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service 

 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 

 

prior to our ipo the fair value of the common stock underlying the stockbased compensation was determined quarterly on or about the final day of the quarter the valuation methodology was based on a variety of qualitative and quantitative factors including the nature of the business and history of the enterprise 

the economic outlook in general the condition of the specific industries in which we operate the financial condition of the business our ability to generate free cash flow and goodwill or other intangible asset value 

 

the fair value of our common stock was determined using generally accepted valuation methodologies including the use of the guideline company method this determination of fair market value employs both a comparable company analysis which examines the valuation multiples of public companies deemed comparable in whole or in part to us and a discounted cash flow analysis that determines a present value of the projected future cash flows of the business the comparable companies are comprised of a combination of public companies in the financial services information and technology businesses these methodologies have been consistently applied since 1997 we regularly assess the underlying assumptions used in the valuation methodologies including the comparable companies to be used in the analysis the future forecasts of revenue and earnings and the impact of market conditions on factors such as the weighted average cost of capital these assumptions are reviewed quarterly with a more comprehensive evaluation performed annually for the comparable company analysis the share price and financial performance of these comparables were updated quarterly based on the most recent public information our stock price was also impacted by the number of shares outstanding as the number of shares outstanding has declined over time our share price has increased the determination of the fair value of our common stock required us to make judgments that were complex and inherently subjective if different assumptions are used in future periods stockbased compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 

 

goodwill and intangibles 

 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets  this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had goodwill and net intangible assets of 8329 million which represents 684 of our total assets during fiscal year 2010 we performed an impairment test as of june 30 2010 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing including an estimate of future expected revenues earnings and cash flows useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units to mitigate undue influence we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets and goodwill neither our initial valuation nor our subsequent analysis have indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of 6327 million as of december 31 2010 

 

pension and postretirement 

 

we account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans this standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive incomeloss net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 

additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard 

 

as of december 31 2009 we adopted the new disclosure requirements that require disclosures about pension plan assets including how investment allocation decisions are made including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies the major categories of plan assets the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 3 on changes in plan assets for the period and significant concentrations of risk within the plan assets see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

 

in determining the discount rate we utilize quoted rates from longterm bond indices and changes in longterm bond rates over the past year cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees as part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better at the measurement date the output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year’s discount rate and quoted rates for longterm bond indices for our pension plan at december 31 2010 we determined this rate to be 549 a decrease of 025 from the 574 rate used at december 31 2009 our postretirement rate is 400 at december 31 2010 a decrease of 050 from the 450 used at december 31 2009 

 

the expected return on plan assets of 825 as of december 31 2010 is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader longterm forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation and the current economic environment our investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 400 debt securities and 600 equity securities as of december 31 2010 the plan assets were allocated 420 debt 560 equity securities and 20 to other investments we have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan the expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category considering the projected cash flow of the pension plan the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit costs we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

 

the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 the future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under medicare part d was effectively changed this legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan we are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted as a result we recorded a noncash tax charge to the provision for income taxes of 24 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

a one percent change in discount rate future rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation would have the following effects 

 

 

 

income taxes 

 

in projecting future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 

 

we follow asc 74010 guidance for accounting for income taxes which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this interpretation we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position as a result of the implementation of this interpretation we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 103 million which was accounted for as an increase to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earningsaccumulated deficit 

 

we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

 

as of december 31 2010 we have federal and state income tax net operating loss carryforwards of 608 million which will expire at various dates from 2011 through 2030 such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows 

 

 

 

the significant majority of the state net operating loss carryforwards were generated by a subsidiary that employs our internal staff as a result of favorable tax deductions from the exercise of employee stock options for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 this subsidiary’s state net operating loss carryforwards are expected to be fully utilized as the subsidiary generates sufficient taxable income to utilize losses 

 

we estimate unrecognized tax positions of 49 million that may be recognized by december 31 2011 due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities net of additional uncertain tax positions

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2010 we had borrowings outstanding under our syndicated revolving credit facility of 3100 million which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 175 a change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts our pretax income and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instruments based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2010 a one percent change in interest rates would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 31 million based on our current level of borrowings

the verisk risk analysis framework 

these four processes correspond to various functional areas inside our customers’ operations 

 

 

 

 

we add value by linking our solutions across these four key processes for example we use the same modeling methods to support the pricing of homeowner’s insurance policies and to quantify the actual losses when damage occurs to insured homes

our history 

we trace our history to 1971 when insurance services office inc or iso started operations as a notforprofit advisory and rating organization providing services for the us pc insurance industry iso was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators as required by law iso’s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance products and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development underwriting and rating functions today those businesses form the core of our risk assessment segment 

over the past decade we have transformed our business beyond its original functions by deepening and broadening our data assets developing a set of integrated risk management solutions and services and addressing new markets through our decision analytics segment 

our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the american insurance services group or aisg and certain operations and assets of the national insurance crime bureau in 1997 and 1998 respectively those organizations brought to the company large databases of insurance claims as well as expertise in detecting and preventing claims fraud to further expand our decision analytics segment we acquired air worldwide or air in 2002 the technological leader in catastrophe modeling in 2004 we entered the healthcare space by acquiring several businesses that now offer webbased analytical and reporting systems for health insurers provider organizations and selfinsured employers in 2005 we entered the mortgage lending sector acquiring the first of several businesses that now provide automated fraud detection compliance and decision support solutions for the us mortgage industry in 2006 to bolster our position in the claims field we acquired xactware a leading supplier of estimating software for professionals involved in building repair and reconstruction 

these acquisitions have added scale geographic reach highly skilled workforces and a wide array of new capabilities to our decision analytics segment they have helped to make us a leading provider of information and decision analytics for customers involved in the business of risk in the us and selectively around the world 

our senior management operating team which includes our chief executive officer chief financial officer chief operating officer general counsel and the three senior officers who lead our largest business units have been with us for an average of almost twenty years this team has led our transformation to a successful forprofit entity focused on growth with our us pc insurer customers and expansion into a variety of new markets 

on may 23 2008 in contemplation of our initial public offering iso formed verisk analytics inc or verisk a delaware corporation to be the holding company for our business verisk was initially formed as a whollyowned subsidiary of iso on october 6 2009 in connection with our initial public offering the company effected a reorganization whereby iso became a whollyowned subsidiary of verisk verisk class a common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on october 7 2009 under the symbol “vrsk”

segments 

we organize our business in two segments risk assessment and decision analytics 

risk assessment segment 

our risk assessment segment serves our pc insurance customers and focuses on the first two decision making processes in our risk analysis framework prediction of loss and selection and pricing of risk within this segment we also provide solutions to help our insurance customers comply with their reporting requirements in each us state in which they operate our customers include most of the pc insurance providers in the us and we have retained approximately 990 of our pc insurance customer base within the risk assessment segment in each of the last five years 

statistical agent and data services 

the pc insurance industry is heavily regulated in the us pc insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate our statistical agent services have enabled pc insurers to meet these regulatory requirements for over 30 years we aggregate the data and as a licensed “statistical agent” in all 50 states puerto rico and the district of columbia we report these statistics to insurance regulators we are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the us pc insurance industry 

to provide our customers and the regulators the information they require we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world over the past four decades we have developed core expertise in acquiring processing managing and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our risk assessment segment we use our proprietary technology to assemble organize and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our customers we supplement this data with publicly available information 

each year pc insurers send us approximately 29 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred we maintain a database of over 145 billion statistical records including over 5 billion commercial lines records and approximately 94 billion personal lines records we collect unittransaction detail of each premium and loss record which enhances the validity reliability and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial analyses our proprietary quality process includes almost 2500 separate checks to ensure that data meet our high standards of quality 

actuarial services 

we provide actuarial services to help our customers price their risks as they underwrite we project future losses and loss expenses utilizing a broad set of data these projections tend to be more reliable than if our customers used solely their own data we provide loss costs by coverage class territory and many other categories our customers can use our estimates of future loss costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies for most pc insurers in most lines of business we believe our loss costs are an essential input to rating decisions we make a number of actuarial adjustments including loss development and loss adjustment expenses before the data is used to estimate future loss costs our actuarial services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industrystandard insurance programs described below 

our employees include over 200 actuarial professionals including 43 fellows and 26 associates of the casualty actuarial society as well as 145 chartered property casualty underwriters 12 certified and 23 associate insurance data managers 178 members of the insurance data management association and 145 professionals with advanced degrees including phds in mathematics and statistical modeling who review both the data and the models 

using our large database of premium and loss data our actuaries are able to perform sophisticated analyses using our predictive models and analytic methods to help our pc insurance customers with pricing loss reserving and marketing we distribute a number of actuarial products and offer flexible services to meet our customers’ needs in addition our actuarial consultants provide customized services for our clients that include assisting them with the development of independent insurance programs analysis of their own underwriting experience development of classification systems and rating plans and a wide variety of other business decisions we also supply information to a wide variety of customers in other markets including reinsurance government agencies and real estate

industrystandard insurance programs 

we are the recognized leader in the us for industrystandard insurance programs that help pc insurers define coverages and issue policies our policy language prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our customers insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language rules and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements insurers must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes or case law to meet their needs we process and interface with state regulators on average over 4000 filings each year ensuring smooth implementation of our rules and forms when insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs our industrystandard insurance programs also help regulators make sure that such insurers’ policies meet basic coverage requirements

standardized coverage language which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants as a result our industrystandard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known our policy language includes standard coverage language endorsements and policy writing support language that assist our customers in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they are offering with these policy programs insurers also benefit from economies of scale we have over 200 specialized lawyers and insurance experts reviewing changes in each state’s insurance rules and regulations including on average over 11200 legislative bills 1100 regulatory actions and 2000 court cases per year to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information

to cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace we offer a broad range of policy programs for example in the homeowner’s line of insurance we maintain policy language and rules for six basic coverages 180 national endorsements and 489 statespecific endorsements overall we provide policy language prospective loss costs policy writing rules and a variety of other solutions for 24 lines of insurance

propertyspecific rating and underwriting information 

we gather information on individual properties and communities so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price personal and commercial property insurance as well as commercial liability insurance our propertyspecific rating and underwriting information allow our customers to understand quantify underwrite mitigate and avoid potential loss for residential and commercial properties our database contains loss costs and other vital information on approximately 28 million commercial buildings in the united states and also holds information on approximately 54 million individual businesses occupying those buildings we have a staff of more than 600 field representatives strategically located around the united states who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties evaluate community fireprotection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of municipal buildingcode enforcement each year our field staff visits over 350000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings and verify building attributes

we also provide proprietary analytic measures of the ability of individual communities to mitigate losses from important perils nearly every property insurer in the us uses our evaluations of community firefighting capabilities to help determine premiums for fire insurance throughout the country we provide fieldverified and validated data on the fire protection services for more than 46000 fire response jurisdictions we also offer services to evaluate the effectiveness of community enforcement of building codes and the efforts of communities to mitigate damage from flooding further we provide information on the insurance rating territories premium taxes crime risk and hazards of windstorm earthquake wildfire and other perils to supplement our data on specific commercial properties and individual communities we have assembled from a variety of internal and thirdparty sources information on hazards related to geographic locations representing every postal address in the us insurers use this information not only for policy quoting but also for analyzing risk concentration in geographical areas

decision analytics segment 

in the decision analytics segment we support all four phases of our risk analysis framework we develop predictive models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better predict loss select and price risk detect fraud before and after a loss event and quantify losses

  7 

as we develop our models to quantify loss and detect fraud we improve our ability to predict the loss and prevent the fraud from happening we believe this provides us with a significant competitive advantage over firms that do not offer solutions which operate both before and after loss events

fraud detection and prevention 

pc insurance 

we are a leading provider of frauddetection tools for the pc insurance industry our fraud solutions improve our customers’ profitability by both predicting the likelihood that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred when a claim is submitted our system searches our database and returns information about other claims filed by the same individuals or businesses either as claimants or insurers that help our customers determine if fraud has occurred the system searches for matches in identifying information fields such as name address social security number vehicle identification number driver’s license number tax identification number or other parties to the loss our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches information from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim negotiation of a reduced award or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement

we have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and investigations professionals to process claims and fight fraud claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against insurance fraud the benefits of a single allclaims database include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for information enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious claims and superior information for investigating fraudulent claims suspicious individuals and possible fraud rings our database contains information on more than 668 million claims and is the world’s largest database of claims information insurers and other participants submit new claim reports more than 235000 a day on average across all categories of the us pc insurance industry

we also provide a service allowing insurers to report thefts of automobiles and property improving the chances of recovering those items a service that helps owners and insurers recover stolen heavy construction and agricultural equipment an expert scoring system that helps distinguish between suspicious and meritorious claims and products that use linkanalysis technology to help visualize and fight insurance fraud

we have begun to expand our fraud solutions to overseas markets we built and launched a system in israel in 2006 that provides claims fraud detection claims investigation support and some underwriting services to all israeli insurers

mortgage 

we are a leading provider of automated fraud detection compliance and decisionsupport tools for the mortgage industry utilizing our own loan level application database combined with actual mortgage loan performance data we have established a risk scoring system which increases our customers’ ability to detect fraud we provide solutions that detect fraud through each step of the mortgage lifecycle and provide regulatory compliance solutions that perform instant compliance reviews of each mortgage application our fraud solutions can improve our customers’ profitability by predicting the likelihood that a customer account is experiencing fraud our solution analyzes customer transactions in real time and generates recommendations for immediate action which are critical to stopping fraud and abuse these applications can also detect some organized fraud schemes that are too complex and wellhidden to be identified by other methods

  8 

effective fraud detection relies on pattern identification which in turn requires us to identify isolate and track mortgage applications through time histories of multiple loans both valid and fraudulent are required to compare a submitted loan both to actual data and heuristic analyses for this reason unless fraud detection solutions are fueled by comprehensive data their practicality is limited our proprietary database contains more than 13 million current and historical loan applications collected over the past three years this database contains data from loan applications as well as supplementary thirdparty data 

our technology employs sophisticated models to identify patterns in the data our solution provides a score which predicts whether the information provided by a mortgage applicant is correct working with data obtained through our partnership with a credit bureau we have demonstrated a strong correlation between fraudulent information in the application and the likelihood of both foreclosure and early payment default on loans we believe our solution is based upon a more comprehensive set of loan level information than any other provider in the mortgage industry 

we also provide forensic audit services for the mortgage origination and mortgage insurance industries our predictive screening tools predict which defaulted loans are the most likely candidates for full audits for the purpose of detecting fraud we then generate detailed audit reports on defaulted mortgage loans those reports serve as a key component of the loss mitigation strategies of mortgage loan insurers the recent turmoil in the mortgage industry has created a period of unprecedented opportunity for growth in demand for our services as we believe most mortgage insurers do not have the inhouse capacity to respond to and properly review all of their defaulted loans for evidence of fraud 

healthcare 

we offer solutions that help healthcare claims payors detect fraud abuse and overpayment our approach combines computerbased modeling and profiling of claims with analysis performed by clinical experts we run our customers’ claims through our proprietary analytic system to identify potential fraud abuse and overpayment and then a registered nurse physician or other clinical specialist skilled in coding and reimbursement decisions reviews all suspect claims and billing patterns this combination of system and human review is unique in the industry and we believe offers improved accuracy for paying claims 

we analyze the patterns of claims produced by individual physicians physicians’ practices hospitals dentists and pharmacies to locate the sources of fraud after a suspicious source of claims is identified our realtime analytic solutions investigate each claim individually for particular violations including upcoding multiple billings services claimed but not rendered and billing by unlicensed providers by finding the individual claims with the most costrecovery potential and also minimizing the number of falsepositive indications of fraud we enable the special investigation units of healthcare payors to efficiently control their claims costs while maintaining high levels of customer service to their insurers 

we also offer webbased reporting tools that let payors take definitive action to prevent overpayments or payment of fraudulent claims the tools provide the documentation that helps to identify investigate and prevent abusive and fraudulent activity by providers 

prediction of loss and selection and pricing of risk 

pc insurance 

we pioneered the field of probabilistic catastrophe modeling used by insurers reinsurers and financial institutions to manage their catastrophe risk our models of global natural hazards which form the basis of our solutions enable companies to identify quantify and plan for the financial consequences of catastrophic events we have developed models covering natural hazards including hurricanes earthquakes winter storms tornadoes hailstorms and flood for potential loss events in more than 50 countries we have also developed and introduced a probabilistic terrorism model capable of quantifying the risk in the us from this emerging threat which supports pricing and underwriting decisions down to the level of an individual policy 

healthcare 

we are a leading provider of healthcare business intelligence and predictive modeling we provide analytical and reporting systems to health insurers provider organizations and selfinsured employers those organizations use our solutions to review their healthcare data including information on claims membership providers and utilization and provide cost trends forecasts and actuarial financial and utilization analyses 

  9 

for example our solutions allow our customers to predict medical costs and improve the financing and organization of health services our predictive models help our customers identify highcost cases for care and diseasemanagement intervention compare providers adjusting for differences in health predict resource use for individuals and populations establish healthbased and performancebased payments negotiate payments and incentives negotiate premium rates and measure return on investment 

we also provide our customers healthcare consulting services using complex clinical analyses to uncover reasons behind cost and utilization increases physicians and hospitals are adopting and acquiring new technologies drugs and devices more rapidly than ever before we provide financial and actuarial consulting clinical consulting technical and implementation services and training services to help our customers manage costs and risks to their practices 

we are also beginning to expand our healthcare business internationally we have recently secured an agreement with the german government to develop a riskadjustment methodology based on our solutions our diagnosisbased riskadjustment methods and predictive modeling tools will support the german healthcare system in the improvement of quality and efficiency of care 

quantification of loss 

pc insurance 

we provide data analytic and networking products for professionals involved in estimating all phases of building repair and reconstruction we provide solutions for every phase of a building’s life including 

 

 

 

 

to help our customers estimate replacement costs we also provide a solution that assists contractors and insurance adjusters to estimate repairs using a patented plansketching program the program allows our customers to sketch floor plans roof plans and wallframing plans and automatically calculates material and labor quantities for the construction of walls floors footings and roofs

we also estimate industrywide insured losses from individual catastrophic events we report information on disasters and determine the extent and type of damage dates of occurrence and geographic areas affected we define a catastrophe as an event that causes 25 million or more in direct insured losses to property and that affects a significant number of policyholders and insurers for each catastrophe our loss estimate represents anticipated industrywide insurance payments for property lines of insurance covering fixed property building contents timeelement losses vehicles and inland marine diverse goods and properties we assign a serial number that allows our customers to track losses and reserves related to a single discrete event under many reinsurance contracts and catastrophe bonds our serial number is important for determining which losses will trigger reinsurance coverage or payment 

our estimates allow our customers to set loss reserves deploy field adjusters and verify internal company estimates our estimates also keep insurers their customers regulators and other interested parties informed about the total costs of disasters we also provide our customers access to daily reports on severe weather and catastrophes and we maintain a database of information on catastrophe losses in the us since 1950

sales marketing and customer support 

we sell our products and services primarily through direct interaction with our clients we employ a threetier sales structure that includes salespeople product specialists and sales support as of december 31 2009 we had a sales force of 137 people within the company several areas have sales teams that specialize in specific products and services these specialized sales teams sell specific highly technical product sets to targeted markets 

to provide account management to our largest customers we segment the insurance market into two groups national accounts constitutes our 20 largest customers and strategic accounts includes all other insurance companies each market segment has its own sales team salespeople are responsible for our overall relationship with pc insurance companies 

salespeople participate in both customerservice and sales activities they provide direct support interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a positive experience using our services salespeople also seek out new sales opportunities and provide support to the rest of the sales team we believe our salespeople’s product knowledge and local presence differentiates us from our competition product specialists have product expertise and work with salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned products both salespeople and product specialists have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities a team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination between the two groups 

sources of our data 

the data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions are sourced through six different kinds of data arrangements first we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created upon their data these agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out and represent our primary method of data gathering it is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data second we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide to the data contributors their required levels of privacy protection of data and where necessary deidentification of data these agreements represent no cost to us and generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions and require renewal third we “mine” data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions as an example we utilize the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models again these arrangements represent no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way fourth we source data generally at no cost from public sources including federal state and local governments fifth we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff that also perform property surveys at the request of and facilitated by property insurers lastly we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased including county tax assessor records descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional licenses in all our modes of data collection we are the owners of whatever derivative solutions we create using the data because of the efficiency of our data gathering methods and the lack of any cost associated with a large portion of our data our costs of data received from our customers were 19 and 18 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively

information technology 

technology 

our information technology systems are fundamental to our success they are used for the storage processing access and delivery of the data which forms the foundation of our business and the development and delivery of our solutions provided to our clients much of the technology we use and provide to our clients is developed maintained and supported by approximately 800 employees we generally own or have secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business all the customerfacing applications which are material to our operations we support and implement a mix of technologies focused on implementing the most efficient technology for any given business requirement or task 

data centers 

we have two primary data centers in jersey city new jersey and orem utah in addition we have data centers dedicated to certain business units including air and verisk health in boston and aisg claimsearch in israel in addition to these key data centers we also have a number of smaller data centers located in other states 

disaster recovery 

we are committed to a framework for business continuity management and carry out annual reviews of the state of preparedness of each business unit all of our critical databases systems and contracted client services are also regularly recovered we also have documented disaster recovery plans in place for each of our major data centers and each of our solutions our primary data center recovery site is in new york state approximately 50 miles northwest of jersey city new jersey 

security 

we have adopted a wide range of measures to ensure the security of our it infrastructure and data security measures generally cover the following key areas physical security logical security of the perimeter network security such as firewalls logical access to the operating systems deployment of virus detection software and appropriate policies and procedures relating to removable media such as laptops all laptops are encrypted and media leaving our premises that is sent to a thirdparty storage facility is also encrypted this commitment has led us to achieve certification from cybertrust an industry leader in information security certification since 2002 

intellectual property 

we own a significant number of intellectual property rights including copyrights trademarks trade secrets and patents specifically our policy language insurance manuals software and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue we also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the us and foreign countries including the names of our products and services and our logos and tag lines many of which are registered we believe many of our trademarks trade names service marks and logos to be of material importance to our business as they assist our customers in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them we consider our intellectual property to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of statutory eg copyright trademark trade secret and patent and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect them wherever they are used 

we also own several software method and processing patents and have several pending patent applications in the us that complement our products the patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to technology including a patent for our claims outcome advisor software and for our xactware sketch product we believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and which are material to our business 

in order to maintain control of our intellectual property we enter into license agreements with our customers granting each customer a license to use our products and services including our software and databases this helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions as a general practice employees contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights information and technology 

  14 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we employed 4072 fulltime and 181 parttime employees none of our employees are represented by unions we consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements 

regulation 

because our business involves the distribution of certain personal public and nonpublic data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility service and marketing decisions based on such data certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws in the united states and to a lesser extent foreign countries examples of such regulation include the fair credit reporting act which regulates the use of consumer credit report information the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of nonpublic personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions the health insurance portability and accountability act which restricts the public disclosure of patient information and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to healthcare businesses the drivers privacy protection act which prohibits the public disclosure use or resale by any state’s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record except for a “permissible purpose” and various other federal state and local laws and regulations 

these laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used to challenge the accuracy of such information andor to prevent the use and disclosure of such information in certain instances these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances 

we are also licensed as a rating rate service advisory or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all fifty states puerto rico guam the virgin islands and the district of columbia as such an advisory organization we provide statistical actuarial policy language development and related products and services to propertycasualty insurers including advisory prospective loss costs other prospective cost information manual rules and policy language we also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policywriting and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators 

many of our products services and operations as well as insurer use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the mccarranferguson act as a result many of our operations and products are subject to review andor approval by state regulators furthermore our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes which are typically enforced by state attorneys general andor insurance regulators

available information 

we maintain an investor relations website on the internet at investorveriskcom  we make available free of charge on or through this website our annual quarterly and current reports and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are electronically filed with or furnished to the sec to access these click on the “financial information”  “sec filings” link found on our investor relations homepage verisk trades on the nasdaq global select market under the ticker symbol “vrsk” our stock was first publicly traded on october 7 2009 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k before deciding to invest in shares of our class a common stock if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer in such case the trading price of our class a common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment 

we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions 

we depend upon data from external sources including data received from customers and various government and public record services for information used in our databases in general we do not own the information in these databases and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons and we could also become subject to legislative or judicial restrictions on the use of such data in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use andor process the data in addition many of our customers are significant stockholders of our company specifically all of our class b common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers and provide us with a significant percentage of our data if our customers’ percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms if a substantial number of data sources or certain key sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

agreements with our data suppliers are shortterm agreements some suppliers are also competitors which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data which would give our competitors an advantage such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources 

we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from us pc primary insurers if the downturn in the us insurance industry continues or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions our revenues will decline 

revenues derived from solutions we provide to us pc primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2009 approximately 596 of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to us pc primary insurers also sales of certain of our solutions are tied to premiums in the us pc insurance market which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control in addition our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by pc primary insurers include the following 

 

 

  16 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a continued downturn in the insurance industry or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

there may be consolidation in our end customer market which would reduce the use of our services 

mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers or that use fewer of our services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon for example in the pc insurance services sector any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions our business could suffer serious harm 

our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions if we are unable to develop new solutions or if we are not successful in introducing andor obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate in addition significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in the past we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions primarily due to difficulties developing models acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments errors or defects in our solutions that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection of our solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenues diversion of development resources an increase in product liability claims and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims 

we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them our business could be harmed 

our success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights to date we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology this protection of our proprietary technology is limited and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent in addition patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products any disclosure loss invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position and ultimately our business our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others including our competitors may use our proprietary technology without our consent furthermore litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  17 

we could face claims for intellectual property infringement which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers 

there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings particularly in the united states regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry there is a risk that we are infringing or may in the future infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties we monitor thirdparty patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analyses where we deem appropriate however such monitoring and analysis has not been and is unlikely in the future to be comprehensive and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications since the patent application process can take several years to complete there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies as a result we may infringe existing and future thirdparty patents of which we are not aware as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 

thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions even if we prevail litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management’s time and attention 

if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop noninfringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

because personal public and nonpublic information is stored in some of our databases we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act grammleachbliley act driver’s privacy protection act health insurance portability and accountability act the european union’s data protection directive and to a lesser extent various other federal state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace however many consumer advocates privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information particularly social security numbers department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth as a result they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse affect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent data access and other security breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation 

security breaches in our facilities computer networks and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems thirdparty contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information if users gain improper access to our databases they may be able to steal publish delete or modify confidential thirdparty information that is stored or transmitted on our networks 

in addition customers’ misuse of our information services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers any such misappropriation andor misuse of our information could result in us among other things being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation 

a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  18 

 

we may detect incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 

we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may lose key business assets including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links the internet or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 

our operations depend on our ability as well as that of thirdparty service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure fire power loss telecommunications failure impacts of terrorism breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers natural disasters or other disasters the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers in addition we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time any damage to our data centers failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements resulting in decreased revenue operating income and earnings per share 

we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively 

some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive and are expected to remain highly competitive we compete on the basis of quality customer service product and service selection and price our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment due to their size certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can as a result these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences emerging technologies and market trends in addition new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments especially against larger competitors we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete if we fail to successfully compete our business financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 

acquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences 

our longterm business strategy includes growth through acquisitions future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses such risks include among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  19 

 

 

 

 

 

the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets any of which could harm our financial condition 

we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities although we have capacity under our uncommitted facilities lenders are not required to loan us any funds under such facilities the current disruptions in the capital markets have caused banks and other credit providers to restrict availability of borrowing and new credit facilities therefore future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases the demand for some of our solutions may decrease 

public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 

our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of almost twenty years however with the exception of frank j coyne our chairman and chief executive officer we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team if we lose key members of our senior management operating team we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers 

our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees if our attrition rate increases our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries such as software services engineering services and financial services companies and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work if our business continues to grow the number of people we will need to hire will increase we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs 

we are subject to antitrust and other litigation and may in the future become subject to further such litigation an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability 

we participate in businesses particularly insurancerelated businesses and services that are subject to substantial litigation including antitrust litigation we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business we currently are defending against several putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims see “item 3 legal proceedings” our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that to the extent not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition revenues and profitability given the nature of our business we may be subject to similar litigation in the future even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth 

  20 

our liquidity financial position and profitability could be adversely affected by further deterioration in us and international credit markets and economic conditions 

deterioration in the global capital markets has caused financial institutions to seek additional capital merge with larger financial institutions and in some cases fail these conditions have led to concerns by market participants about the stability of financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties resulting in a contraction of available credit even for the most creditworthy borrowers due to recent market events our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing may be negatively impacted if one of our lenders under our revolving credit facilities or existing shelf arrangements fails to meet its funding obligations in such an event we may not be able to draw on all or a substantial portion of our uncommitted credit facilities which would adversely affect our liquidity also if we attempt to obtain future financing in addition to or replacement of our existing credit facilities to finance our continued growth through acquisitions or otherwise the credit market turmoil could negatively impact our ability to obtain such financing 

general economic political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business 

the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including macroeconomic political and market conditions the availability of shortterm and longterm funding and capital the level and volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and inflation the united states economy experienced periods of contraction during 2008 and 2009 and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of recent years any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition the current volatility in of the credit markets and its effect on the economy may continue to negatively impact financial institutions a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions in addition the decline of the credit markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators and therefore the immediate demand for our related mortgage solutions specifically certain of our fraud detection and prevention solutions are directed at the mortgage market this decline in asset value and originations and an increase in foreclosure levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage originations and securitizations any new regulatory regime may change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our solutions to new regulation 

if there are substantial sales of our common stock our stock price could decline 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive 

as of december 31 2009 our stockholders who owned our shares prior to the ipo continue to beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 27819850 shares of our class a common stock and 54237950 shares of our class b common stock representing in aggregate approximately 456 of our outstanding common stock such stockholders will be able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration and subject to limitations on the timing amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock the market price of our common stock could decline significantly in addition the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

certain members of our management are subject to lockup agreements with us whereby they are not be permitted to sell any of their common stock subject to certain conditions for a period of time also pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our class b stockholders are not able to sell any of their common stock subject to certain conditions to the public for a period of time each share of class b series 1 common stock shall convert automatically without any action by the holder into one share of class a common stock on april 6 2011 each share of class b series 2 common stock shall convert automatically without any action by the holder into one share of class a common stock on october 6 2011 

  21 

our board of directors may approve exceptions to the limitation on transfers of our class b common stock in their sole discretion in connection with the sale of such class b common stock in a public offering registered with the securities and exchange commission or in such other limited circumstances as our board of directors may determine any class b common stock sold to the public will first be converted to class a common stock such further resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

pursuant to our equity incentive plans options to purchase approximately 26761221 shares of class a common stock were outstanding as of march 9 2010 we filed a registration statement under the securities act which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans including for such outstanding options as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

also in the future we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock 

the holders of our class b common stock have the right to elect up to three out of twelve of our directors and their interests in our business may be different than yours 

until no class b common stock remains outstanding the holders of our class b common stock will have the right to elect up to three of our directors stockholders of the class b common stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable for the holders of class a common stock or their interests may otherwise conflict with those of class a stockholders for example holders of our class b common stock may seek to cause us to take courses of action that in their judgment could enhance their investment in us or the use of our solutions but which might involve risks to holders of our class a common stock including a potential decrease in the price of our class a common stock 

our capital structure level of indebtedness and the terms of antitakeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us as a public company we are subject to section 203 which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 150 or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions but we do not intend to do so 

  22 

these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k  as well as the discussion under “selected consolidated financial data” this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including but not limited to those listed under “risk factors” and “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

we enable riskbearing businesses to better understand and manage their risks we provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that combined with our analytic methods creates embedded decision support solutions we are the largest aggregator and provider of data pertaining to us property and casualty or pc insurance risks we offer solutions for detecting fraud in the us pc insurance mortgage and healthcare industries and sophisticated methods to predict and quantify loss in diverse contexts ranging from natural catastrophes to health insurance 

  26 

our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions with greater efficiency and discipline we refer to these products and services as ‘solutions’ due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products these solutions take various forms including data statistical models or tailored analytics all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions we believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers’ revenues and help them better manage their costs 

on may 23 2008 in contemplation of our initial public offering insurance service office inc or iso formed verisk analytics inc or verisk a delaware corporation to be the holding company for our business verisk was initially formed as a whollyowned subsidiary of iso on october 6 2009 in connection with our initial public offering we effected a reorganization whereby iso became a whollyowned subsidiary of verisk 

we organize our business in two segments risk assessment and decision analytics our risk assessment segment provides statistical actuarial and underwriting data for the us pc insurance industry our risk assessment segment revenues represented approximately 510 and 564 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively our decision analytics segment provides solutions our customers use to analyze the four processes of the verisk risk analysis framework prediction of loss selection and pricing of risk detection and prevention of fraud and quantification of loss our decision analytics segment revenues represented approximately 490 and 436 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

executive summary 

key performance metrics 

we believe our business’s ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy we use year over year revenue growth and ebitda margin as metrics to measure our performance ebitda and ebitda margin are nongaap financial measures see note 3 within item 6 selected financial data section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

revenue growth we use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers sales to new customers sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses 

ebitda margin we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth 

revenues 

we earn revenues through subscriptions longterm agreements and on a transactional basis subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year as a result the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period in general we experience minimal seasonality within the business our longterm agreements are generally for periods of three to seven years we recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most longterm agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 

certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis for example we have solutions that allow our customers to access fraud detection tools in the context of an individual mortgage application obtain propertyspecific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building or compare a pc insurance medical or workers’ compensation claim with information in our databases for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 290 and 244 of our revenues respectively were derived from providing transactional solutions we earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed in general transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month 

more than 838 and 817 of the revenues in our risk assessment segment for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions our customers in this segment include most of the pc insurance providers in the united states and we have retained approximately 99 of our pc insurance customer base in each of the last five years more than 577 and 676 of the revenues in our decision analytics segment for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively were derived from subscriptions and longterm agreements for our solutions 

  27 

principal operating costs and expenses 

personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses include salaries benefits incentive compensation equity compensation costs described under “equity compensation costs” below sales commissions employment taxes recruiting costs and outsourced temporary agency costs which represented 676 and 635 of our total expenses for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the increased percentage of personnel expenses in 2009 is primarily related to the accelerated esop allocation that occured prior to our initial public offering the accelerated esop allocation resulted in a one time noncash charge of 577 million excluding this accelerated esop allocation personnel expenses represented 648 of our total expenses for the year ended december 31 2009 

we allocate personnel expenses between two categories cost of revenues and selling general and administrative costs based on the actual costs associated with each employee we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues and all other personnel including executive managers sales people marketing business development finance legal human resources and administrative services as selling general and administrative expenses a significant portion of our other operating costs such as facilities and communications are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed 

while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues historically our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses 

cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our nextgeneration solutions our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization 

selling general and administrative expense our selling general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities insurance and communications are also allocated to selling general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee our selling general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization 

description of acquisitions 

we acquired six businesses since january 1 2008 as a result of these acquisitions our consolidated results of operations may not be comparable between periods 

on february 26 2010 we acquired 100 of the common stock of strategic analytics inc or strategic analytics a privately owned provider of credit risk and capital management solutions to consumer and mortgage lenders for a net cash purchase price of 77 million of which 15 million was used to fund the indemnity escrows the preliminary allocation of the purchase price resulted in tangible assets of 25 million and we are still evaluating the allocation of the purchase price related to intangible assets and goodwill within our decision analytics segment strategic analytics’ solutions and application set will allow our customers to take advantage of stateoftheart loss forecasting stress testing and economic capital requirement tools to better understand and forecast the risk associated within their credit portfolios as this business was acquired after december 31 2009 the financial results of this business are not included in this annual report on form 10k 

on october 30 2009 we acquired the net assets of enablu technology corporation inc or enablu a privately owned provider of data management training and communication solutions to companies with regional national or global work forces we believe this acquisition will enhance our ability to provide solutions for customers to measure loss prevention and improve asset management through the use of software and software services 

on july 24 2009 we acquired the net assets of tiermed systems llc or tiermed a privately owned provider of healthcare effectiveness data and information set or hedis solutions to healthcare organizations that have hedis or qualityreporting needs we believe this acquisition will enhance our ability to provide solutions for customers to measure and improve healthcare quality and financial performance through the use of software and software services 

on january 14 2009 we acquired 100 of the stock of d2 hawkeye inc or d2 a privatelyowned provider of data mining decision support clinical quality analysis and risk analysis tools for the healthcare industry we believe this acquisition will enhance our position in the healthcare analytics and predictive modeling market by providing new market crosssell and diversification opportunities for the company’s expanding healthcare solutions 

on november 20 2008 we acquired 100 of the stock of atmospheric and environmental research inc or aer aer provides research and consulting services to further understanding of the global environment and to enable better decision making in response to weather and climate risk the purchase includes a contingent payment provision subject to the achievement of certain predetermined financial results for the years ended 2010 and 2011 we believe the acquisition of aer further enhances our environmental and scientific research and predictive modeling 

on november 14 2008 we acquired the net assets of zaio’s two divisions united systems software company and day one technology the assets associated with this acquisition further enhance the capability of our appraisal software offerings within our risk assessment segment

equity compensation costs 

we have a leveraged esop funded with intercompany debt that includes 401k esop and profit sharing components to provide employees with equity participation we make quarterly cash contributions to the plan equal to the debt service requirements as the debt is repaid shares are released to the esop to fund 401k matching and profit sharing contributions and the remainder is allocated annually to active employees in proportion to their eligible compensation in relation to total participants’ eligible compensation 

we accrue compensation expense over the reporting period equal to the fair value of the shares to be released to the esop depending on the number of shares released to the plan during the quarter and the fluctuation in the fair value of the shares a corresponding increase or decrease in compensation expense will occur the amount of our equity compensation costs recognized for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 are as follows 

 

in connection with our initial public offering on october 6 2009 we accelerated our future esop allocation contribution through the end of the esop in 2013 to all participants eligible for a contribution in 2009 this resulted in a nonrecurring noncash charge of approximately 577 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result subsequent to the offering the noncash esop allocation expense will be substantially reduced excluding the esop allocation expense relating specifically to our 401k and profit sharing plans were 87 million 97 million and 84 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

in addition the portion of the esop allocation expense related to the appreciation of the value of the shares in the esop above the value of those shares when the esop was first established is not tax deductible therefore we believe the accelerated esop allocation in the fourth quarter of 2009 will result in a reduction of approximately 14 to our effective tax rate in years subsequent to the completion of our initial public offering 

in connection with our initial public offering on october 6 2009 we granted options to purchase 2875871 shares of our verisk class a common stock to our directors officers and employees assuming that all of the service conditions are met we expect the related expense will be approximately 60 million 60 million 54 million and 27 million for 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively 

prior to our initial public offering our class a stock and vested stock options were recorded within redeemable common stock at full redemption value at each balance sheet date as the redemption of these securities was not solely within the control of the company see note 14 of our consolidated financial statements effective with the corporate reorganization that occurred on october 6 2009 we are no longer obligated to redeem class a stock and therefore are not required to present our class a stock and vested stock options at redemption value our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2009 reflect a reversal of the redeemable common stock the reversal of the redeemable common stock of 10649 million on october 6 2009 resulted in the elimination of accumulated deficit of 4406 million an increase of 01 million to class a common stock at par value an increase of 6243 million to additional paidincapital and a reclassification of the iso class a unearned common stock ksop shares balance of 13 million to unearned ksop contribution see note 16 in our consolidated financial statements 

  29 

public company expenses 

beginning in 2008 our selling general and administrative costs increased as we prepared for our initial public offering these costs were 70 million and 65 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively these costs negatively affected our ebitda margins by 07 for each year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 following our initial public offering we incurred additional selling general and administrative expenses related to operating as a public company such as increased legal and accounting expenses the cost of an investor relations function costs related to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and increased director and officer insurance premiums 

trends affecting our business 

a portion of our revenues is related to changes in historical insurance premiums therefore our revenues could be positively or negatively affected by growth or declines in premiums for the lines of insurance for which we perform services the pricing of these solutions is based on an individual customer’s premiums in a prior period so the pricing is fixed at the inception of each calendar year the impact of insurance premiums has a more significant impact on the risk assessment segment than it does on the decision analytics segment since 2005 premium growth in the pc insurance industry has slowed and we expect little or no growth for most insurance lines during 2010 a significant portion of our revenues is from insurance companies although business and new sales from these companies have generally remained strong the current economic environment could negatively impact buying demand for our solutions 

a portion of our revenues in the decision analytics segment is tied to the volume of applications for new mortgages or refinancing of existing mortgages turmoil in the mortgage market since 2007 has adversely affected revenue in this segment of our business this trend began to reverse in late 2008 spurred by lower mortgage interest rates as a result of the rise in foreclosures and early pay defaults we have seen and expect to see in the future an increase in revenues from our solutions that help our customers focus on improved underwriting quality of mortgage loans these solutions help to ensure the application data is accurate and identify and rapidly settle bad loans which may have been originated based upon fraudulent information 

recent events within the united states economy have resulted in further tightening in credit availability which has resulted in higher interest rates for corporate borrowers due to recent market events our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing may be negatively impacted if one of our lenders fails to meet its funding obligations borrowings under our longterm debt facilities are at fixed interest rates while we expect future borrowings will be at higher interest rates which will translate into higher interest expense in the future we do not expect this to have a material impact on our business in the nearterm we have been able to adequately secure credit arrangements for the financing of our business and have recently entered into a 4200 million committed syndicated revolving credit facility with bank of america na as administrative agent which matures on july 2 2012 interest is payable on borrowings under this credit facility at variable rates of interest based on libor plus 250 we will continue to explore financing alternatives in order to fund future growth opportunities 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

consolidated results of operations

cost of revenues was 4913 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 3869 million for the year ended december 31 2008 an increase of 1044 million or 270 the increase was primarily due to the accelerated esop allocation which resulted in a nonrecurring noncash charge of 444 million prior to our intial public offering and costs related to the newly acquired companies of 177 million excluding the accelerated esop allocation and the effect of the newly acquired companies our cost of revenues increased 423 million or 109 the increase was primarily due to costs related to an increase in salaries and employee benefits costs of 322 million which include annual salary increases medical costs and pension cost pension cost represents 150 million of the salaries and employee benefit costs increase due to the decline in the market values of pension investments as a result of the global economic downturn in 2008 other increases include third party data costs of 105 million primarily in our decision analytics segment and office maintenance fees of 14 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses of 18 million which include travel and auto related costs 

  30 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses were 1626 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 1312 million for the year ended december 31 2008 an increase of 314 million or 239 the increase was primarily due to the accelerated esop allocation which resulted in a nonrecurring noncash charge of 133 million prior to our initial public offering and costs related to the newly acquired companies of 127 million excluding the accelerated esop allocation and the effect of the newly acquired companies our selling general and administrative expenses increased 54 million or 41 the increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits costs of 103 million which include annual salary increases medical costs commissions and pension costs across a relatively constant employee headcount pension costs represent 31 million of the increases in salaries and employee benefit costs due to the decline in the market values of pension investments as a result of the global economic downturn in 2008 other increases were attributed to other general expenses of 09 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal costs of 38 million and an insurance cost recovery of 20 million

amortization of intangible assets was 326 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 296 million for the year ended december 31 2008 an increase of 30 million or 104 the increase is the result of the amortization of intangibles from our new acquisitions partially offset by certain intangible assets having been fully amortized in 2008 we amortize intangible assets obtained through acquisitions over the periods that we expect to derive benefit from such assets 

investment income and realized lossesgains on securities net 

investment income and realized lossesgains on securities net was 21 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 03 million for the year ended december 31 2008 an increased loss of 18 million investment income for the year ended december 31 2009 includes 03 million of investment income partially offset by 24 million of otherthan temporary impairment primarily related to a cost basis private equity investment in a telematics business investment income for the year ended december 31 2008 consisted of 22 million of investment income partially offset by a 25 realized loss on sale of securities the decrease in investment income was primarily the result of the termination of the shareholder loan program in 2008 

interest expense 

interest expense was 353 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 313 million for the year ended december 31 2008 an increase of 40 million or 126 this increase is primarily due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings during the year ended december 31 2009

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2009 in management’s opinion the data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and reflects all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of this data the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2009 and 2008 we had cash and cash equivalents and availablefor sale securities of 770 million and 383 million respectively subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period which is usually for one year subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year we have historically generated significant cash flows from operations as a result of this factor as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs including acquisition contingent payments 

we have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that as described above we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or longterm contracts which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered when cash is received for prepayment of invoices we record an asset cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability fees received in advance this current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services in most businesses growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows unlike these businesses our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services 

  37 

our capital expenditures which include noncash purchases of fixed assets as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 were 43 and 37 respectively we estimate our capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately 43 million which primarily include expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with asc 35040 “accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” the amounts capitalized in accordance with asc 98520 “ software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed ” are not significant to the financial statements 

to provide liquidity to our stockholders we have also historically used our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders for the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 we repurchased or redeemed 467 million and 3926 million respectively of our common stock a substantial portion of the share redemption included in the totals above were completed pursuant to the terms of the insurance service office inc 1996 incentive plan the “option plan” the obligation to redeem shares issued under the option plan terminated upon completion of our initial public offering therefore we do not expect to continue our historical practice of using cash for common stock repurchases to provide liquidity to our stockholders 

we provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain qualifying active employees and retirees based on the pension funding policy we expect to contribute approximately 220 million to the pension plan in 2010 under the postretirement plan we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying participants however participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the premium coverage we expect to contribute approximately 50 million to the postretirement plan in 2010 see note 17 to our consolidated financial statement included in this annual report on form 10k

net cash provided by operating activities increased to 3264 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 2479 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to an increase in cash receipts of 1415 million a decrease in excess tax benefit from exercised stock options of 61 million a decrease in payments of acquisition related liabilities of 19 million and a decrease in salary and employee related payments of 102 million due to an additional paycycle that occurred in 2008 our payroll is processed on a biweekly basis thereby requiring an additional paycycle once every ten years this increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in operating expense related payments of 636 million an increase in tax payments of 121 million and an increase in interest payments of 52 million 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 2479 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 2485 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to an additional paycycle of 102 million that occurred in 2008 in addition we had a 50 million minimum required funding to our pension plan and onetime payments associated with the preparation for our initial public offering this decrease was mitigated by growth in net income of 79 million and decreased payments associated with acquisition related liabilities of 115 million

net cash used in financing activities was 1028 million for the year ended december 31 2009 and 1074 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to a decrease in the repurchases of stock of 3458 million partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt of 3125 million a decrease in proceeds from stock options exercised of 226 million and a decrease in excess tax benefit from stock options exercised of 61 million 

net cash used in financing activities was 1074 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and 2126 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to an increase in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and shortterm debt of 650 million and 840 million respectively proceeds from the repayment of exercise price loans of 295 million and a decrease in the repayment of shortterm debt of 1007 million these increases were partially offset by additional repurchases of common stock of 1878 million compared to 2007

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and intangible assets pension and other post retirement benefits stockbased compensation and income taxes actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company’s revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are preformed and information is delivered to our customers revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered fees andor price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term usually one year revenues from transactionbased fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

the company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is postcontract customer support or pcs including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis the company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term the company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include pcs and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term in addition the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 

  40 

we invoice our customers in annual quarterly or monthly installments amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met 

stockbased compensation 

on january 1 2005 we adopted the new accounting standard for share based payment using a prospective approach which required us to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption based on the grant date fair value as the majority of annual grants have a four year vesting term the compensation expense for 2005 through 2007 is not comparable in subsequent periods as there is no compensation expense recorded for the vesting of awards granted from 2002 through 2004 the following table illustrates the amount of annual compensation expense resulting from the implementation of this standard using the prospective approach for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

the fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a blackscholes optionpricing model which requires the use of several estimates including expected term expected riskfree interest rate expected volatility and expected dividend yield 

stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period option grants are expensed ratably over the fouryear vesting period we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1 2005 which requires that stockbased compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 

prior to our initial public offering the fair value of the common stock underlying the stockbased compensation was determined quarterly on or about the final day of the quarter the valuation methodology was based on a variety of qualitative and quantitative factors including the nature of the business and history of the enterprise the economic outlook in general the condition of the specific industries in which we operate the financial condition of the business our ability to generate free cash flow and goodwill or other intangible asset value 

the fair value of our common stock was determined using generally accepted valuation methodologies including the use of the guideline company method this determination of fair market value employs both a comparable company analysis which examines the valuation multiples of public companies deemed comparable in whole or in part to us and a discounted cash flow analysis that determines a present value of the projected future cash flows of the business the comparable companies are comprised of a combination of public companies in the financial services information and technology businesses these methodologies have been consistently applied since 1997 we regularly assess the underlying assumptions used in the valuation methodologies including the comparable companies to be used in the analysis the future forecasts of revenue and earnings and the impact of market conditions on factors such as the weighted average cost of capital these assumptions are reviewed quarterly with a more comprehensive evaluation performed annually for the comparable company analysis the share price and financial performance of these comparables were updated quarterly based on the most recent public information our stock price was also impacted by the number of shares outstanding as the number of shares outstanding has declined over time our share price has increased the determination of the fair value of our common stock required us to make judgments that were complex and inherently subjective if different assumptions are used in future periods stockbased compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future

goodwill and intangibles 

goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  this testing compares carrying values to fair values and when appropriate the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value 

as of december 31 2009 we had goodwill and net intangible assets of 5994 million which represents 601 of our total assets during fiscal year 2009 we performed an impairment test as of june 30 2009 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing including an estimate of future expected revenues earnings and cash flows useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units to mitigate undue influence we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinitelived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets and goodwill neither our initial valuation nor our subsequent valuations have indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of 4908 million as of december 31 2009 

pension and postretirement 

we account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans this standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income loss net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard 

as of december 31 2009 we adopted the new disclosure requirements that require disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets including how investment allocation decisions are made including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies the major categories of plan assets the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 3 on changes in plan assets for the period and significant concentrations of risk within the plan assets we adopted asc 715 as of december 31 2009 see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize quoted rates from longterm bond indices and changes in longterm bond rates over the past year cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees as part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better at the measurement date the output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year’s discount rate and quoted rates for longterm bond indices for our pension plan at december 31 2009 we determined this rate to be 574 a decrease of 026 from the 60 rate used at december 31 2008 our postretirement rate is consistent with our pension plan rate at december 31 2009 

  42 

the expected return on plan assets of 825 as of december 31 2009 is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader longterm forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation and the current economic environment our investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 400 debt securities and 600 equity securities as of december 31 2009 the plan assets were allocated 390 debt 580 equity securities and 30 to other investments we have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan the expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category considering the projected cash flow of the pension plan the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit costs during 2008 the market values of these investments declined in conjunction with the global economic downturn although the global economic downturn had a significant effect on the fair value of the plan assets at december 31 2008 we believe that the use of the average historical rates of returns is consistent with the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants this decline in market value is the principal reason that net periodic benefit pension cost for the year ended december 31 2009 is 198 million as compared to 17 million for the year ended december 31 2008 an increase of 181 million we will have significantly greater funding obligations in 2010 of approximately 200 million and thereafter until the market value of the plan assets fully recovers we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets 

the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 the future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy 

a one percent change in discount rate future rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation would have the following effects 

 

a one percent change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects 

 

income taxes 

in projecting future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions 

on january 1 2007 we adopted accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of asc 740  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under this interpretation we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position as a result of the implementation of this interpretation we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 103 million which was accounted for as an increase to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earningsaccumulated deficit 

we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined

  43 

as of december 31 2009 we have federal and state income tax net operating loss carryforwards of 751 million which will expire at various dates from 2010 through 2029 such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows 

 

the significant majority of the state net operating loss carryforwards were generated by a subsidiary that employs our internal staff as a result of favorable tax deductions from the exercise of employee stock options for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 this subsidiary’s state net operating loss carryforwards are expected to be fully utilized as the subsidiary generates sufficient taxable income to utilize losses 

we estimate unrecognized tax positions of 35 million that may be recognized by december 31 2010 due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities net of additional uncertain tax positions

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2009 we had borrowings outstanding under our syndicated revolving credit facility of 600 million which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 250 a change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts our pretax income and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instruments based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31 2009 a one percent change in interest rates would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately 06 million based on our current level of borrowings
