strategic competitive operational and reputational risks 

we may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address the changing shopping habits demands and demographics of our customers or realize the intended benefits of strategic initiatives 

the home improvement retail environment like the retail environment generally is rapidly evolving and adapting our business concept to respond to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and their changing demographics is critical to our future success our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to the economic social style and other trends that affect demographic and consumer preferences in a variety of our merchandise categories and service offerings customers’ expectations about how they wish to research purchase and receive products and services have also evolved it is difficult to predict the mix of products and services that our customers will demand as customers begin to expect a more personalized experience our ability to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group is important to our ability to effectively meet customer expectations if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group we may lose market share with respect to those customers 

further we have a store base that requires maintenance investment and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire our capital investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect we must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory known as “shrink” higher rates of shrink which we have experienced from time to time can require operational changes that may increase costs 

failure to identify such trends adapt our business concept implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment improve and maintain safe stores and implement change growth productivity and other strategic initiatives successfully could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for the home improvement products and services we sell the rate of growth of our business our market share and results of operations 

we may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on omnichannel sales and marketing presence if we fail to deliver the capabilities required to execute on them 

our interactions with customers have evolved into an omnichannel experience as they increasingly are using computers tablets mobile phones and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business omnichannel retail is quickly evolving and we must anticipate and meet our customers’ expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors our customerfacing technology systems must appeal to our customers function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience we also need to collect use and share relevant customer data to effectively meet customer expectations of a more personalized experience our ability to collect use and share such data is subject to a number of external factors including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security as well as the change of third party policies restricting data collection use and sharing 

the success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and changing demographics have required us to and will continue to require us to deliver large complex programs requiring integrated planning initiative prioritization and program sequencing these initiatives have required and will continue to require new competencies in many positions and our management employees and contractors have had to and will need to continue to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies products or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off in addition to support our strategic initiatives and the related technology investments needed to implement our strategic investments we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals including technology professionals the market for these professionals is increasingly competitive our results of operations financial condition or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we fail to provide a consistent experience for our customers regardless of sales channel if our technology systems do not meet our customers’ expectations if we are unable to counteract new developments and innovations implemented by our competitors or if we are unable to attract retain and manage the talent succession of additional personnel at various levels of the company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic initiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly changing retail environment 



we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively or if they develop a substantially more effective or lower cost means of meeting customer needs resulting in a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the principal competitive factors in our industry include convenience customer service and experience quality and price of merchandise and services instock levels and merchandise assortment and presentation we face growing competition from online and omnichannel retailers who have a similar product or service offering customers are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine realtime product availability and price using digital tools further online and omnichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services as customers are increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times including sameday and nextday fulfillment lowprice or free shipping and convenient pickup options including curbside pickup instore pickup and buy online pickup instore bopis lockers and we must make investments to keep up with our customers’ evolving shopping preferences our ability to be competitive on delivery times delivery costs and delivery options depends on many factors including successful implementation and the continued maintenance of our initiatives related to supply chain transformation including our marketbased delivery model our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our results 

if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified associates with expanded skill sets or corporate support staff with the capabilities of delivering on strategic objectives we could lose sales to our competitors and our labor costs resulting from operations or the execution of corporate strategies could be negatively affected 

our customers whether they are homeowners renters or commercial businesses expect our associates to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide we compete with other retailers for many of our associates and we are experiencing an unusually competitive labor market wages are increasing across the united states and competitors are offering higher compensation than before due to labor market conditions many associates are in entrylevel or parttime roles with historically high turnover rates which has led to increased training and retention costs particularly in a competitive labor market increasingly our sales associates must have expanded skill sets including in some instances the ability to do inhome or telephone sales we need to attract and retain a diverse workforce that can deliver relevant culturally competent and differentiated experiences for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers additionally in order to deliver on the omnichannel expectations of our customers we rely on the specialized training and capabilities of corporate support staff which are broadly sought after by our competitors further our ability to successfully execute organizational changes including management transitions within the companys senior leadership are critical to our business success if we are unable to hire train manage and retain qualified associates and specialists the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

furthermore our ability to meet our labor needs particularly in a competitive labor market while controlling our costs is subject to a variety of external factors including prevailing wage rates the availability of and competition for talent health care and other benefit costs our brand image and reputation changing demographics and the adoption of new or revised legislation or regulations governing immigration employment labor relations minimum wage and health care benefits periodically we are subject to labor organizing efforts and if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future it could affect how we operate our business and adversely affect our labor costs in addition to our united states and canada operations we have support offices in india and china and any extended disruption of our operations in our different locations whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

positively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is critical to our business success and if our public image and reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers vendors and associates and consequently our business and results of operations 

our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at lowe’s our vendors want to do business with lowe’s and our associates want to work for lowe’s we must continue to manage preserve and grow lowe’s public image and reputation lowe’s actual or perceived position or lack of position on social environmental political public policy or other sensitive issues and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could harm our reputation in addition failure to meet our stated environmental and social goals and consumer and investor concerns about our environmental and social practices are potential sources of reputational risk in addition vendors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence reduce demand for our products and services affect our relationships with current and future vendors impact our results of operations affect our ability to recruit retain and engage our associates and attract regulatory scrutiny the significant expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents 



additionally our proprietary rights in our trademarks trade names service marks domain names copyrights patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business we may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers expose us to litigation and negatively impact our sales profitability cash flows and financial condition 

product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe’s and our brand image if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement action and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities as a result lowe’s reputation as a retailer of highquality products and services including both national and lowe’s private brands could suffer and impact customer loyalty additionally we and our customers have expectations on responsible sourcing under our vendor code of conduct our vendors are required to meet our expectations across multiple areas of compliance including health and safety environmental standards compensation hours of work and prohibitions on child and forced labor if we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity the risk of our standards not being met may increase 

supply chain and thirdparty risks 

disruptions in our international supply chain and our fulfillment network for our products due to factors including the covid19 pandemic trade policy changes and additional tariffs have and continue to affect our results of operations 

circumstances surrounding and related to the covid19 pandemic have created unprecedented impacts on the global supply chain we source stock and sell products from domestic and international vendors and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success impacts related to the covid19 pandemic are placing strains on the domestic and international supply chain that have negatively affected the flow and availability of our products this can and has resulted in higher outofstock inventory positions due to difficulties in timely obtaining products from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products in addition the costs of transportation of those products to our distribution centers and stores have increased while availability of transportation has decreased which could negatively affect our business and financial results even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products they may cost more which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition 

we source a large number of our products from foreign manufacturers with china being the dominant import source tax and trade policies tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries especially china enacted in recent years increased the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the us which represents a large percentage of our overall merchandise it remains unclear how tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations may evolve in the future which could adversely affect our business results of operations effective income tax rate liquidity and net income in addition other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in us trade policy and regulations already enacted or that may be enacted in the future the degree of our exposure is dependent on among other things the type of goods rates imposed and timing of tariffs the impact to our business including net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors while these potential impacts are uncertain they could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

financial instability among key vendors political instability and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain changes in the total costs in our supply chain including fuel and currency exchange rates labor costs or labor shortages among our vendors port labor disputes and security the outbreak of pandemics weatherrelated events natural disasters armed conflicts work stoppages shipping capacity restraints changes in trade policy retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the united states or a major source country tariffs or duties fluctuations in currency exchange rates and transport availability capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs in recent years us ports have been impacted by capacity constraints port congestion and delays periodic labor disputes security issues weatherrelated events and natural disasters which have been further exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic additionally as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we experience delays in inventory increased delivery costs or merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 



our inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national and international brand names we also have relationships with certain suppliers to enable us to sell proprietary products which differentiate us from other retailers the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business many of these vendors and service providers have certain products or specialized skills needed to support our business concept and our strategies if these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or are unable to perform as expected or if we fail to manage them properly or we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to replace them 

failures relating to our thirdparty installer program or by our thirdparty installers could result in increased operational and legal risks and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we contract with thirdparty installers to provide installation services to our customers and as the general contractor we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors including certain licensing and permitting requirements and those relating to the quality and performance of our thirdparty installers our or our thirdparty installers’ failures to effectively manage such requirements and internal processes regarding installation services could result in lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation and may result in the loss of our general contractor licenses which could negatively affect our business 

technology and cybersecurity risks 

our financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems or the information systems of thirdparty vendors are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain improve upgrade and expand those systems 

our efforts to provide an omnichannel experience for our customers include investing in maintaining and making ongoing improvements of our existing information systems that support operations such as sales inventory replenishment merchandise ordering project design and execution transportation receipt processing and fulfillment we also engage thirdparty vendors for a variety of reasons including for digital storage technology and content delivery such vendors may have access to information about our customers associates or vendors our systems and the systems of thirdparty vendors are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events power outages viruses malicious attacks and telecommunications failures or other vulnerabilities and irregularities and as a result we may incur significant expense data loss as well as an erosion of customer confidence additionally we continually make investments in our systems which may introduce disruption our financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain improve upgrade and expand those systems 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omnichannel sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

access to the internet from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them our websites including lowescom are a sales channel for our products and are also a method of making product project and other relevant information available to our customers that impacts our instore sales additionally we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire inform crosssell establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers including through online visualization and configuration tools performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service ransomware or other cyberattacks or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of lowe’s as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services 

our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer employee vendor or company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems assets and such information 



cyber attacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving and high profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major us companies including several large retailers despite widespread recognition of the cyberattack threat and improved data protection methods as with many other retailers we collect process transmit store and delete certain personal information about our customers employees and vendors as well as confidential sensitive proprietary and business personal and payment card information additionally we use thirdparty service providers for certain services such as authentication content delivery backoffice support fraud prevention order and service fulfillment supply chain management customer service workforce management and other functions and we provide such thirdparty service providers with personal and other confidential information necessary for the services concerned we are subject to the risk that unauthorized parties will attempt to gain access to our systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates third party providers or vendors certain of our thirdparty vendors have been subject to disruptions due to ransomware and other cyber attacks we and our thirdparty service providers may not be able to adequately anticipate or prevent a future breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized access to destruction misuse or release of personal information or other sensitive data it can be difficult to preempt or detect everevolving forms of cyberattacks a ransomware attack could prevent us or our thirdparty service providers from accessing data or systems that support lowe’s operations our information security or our service providers’ information security may also be compromised because of human errors including by employees or system errors our systems and our service providers’ systems are additionally vulnerable to a number of other causes such as critical infrastructure outages computer viruses technology system failures catastrophic events or cyberattacks including the use of malicious codes worms phishing and ransomware in the event that our systems are breached or damaged for any reason we may also suffer loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to our business operations while such breach or damage is being remedied should these events occur the unauthorized disclosure loss or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation drive existing and potential customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions or potential liability including possible litigation and punitive damages a security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of data from our information systems or our thirdparty service providers’ information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks and require dedication of substantial resources to manage the aftermath of such a breach 

data privacy and cybersecurity laws in the united states and internationally are constantly changing and the implementation of these laws has become more complex in the united states alone we may be subject to regulation at both the federal and state level for example the california consumer privacy act of 2018 and its subsequent amendment grants california consumers certain rights over their personal information and imposes stringent requirements on the collection use and sharing of “personal information” of california consumers other us states are proposing or have adopted similar laws related to the protection of personal information including the virginia consumer data protection act and the colorado privacy act both of which will go into effect in 2023 and the us federal government is also considering federal privacy legislation in order to maintain our compliance with such laws as they come to fruition we may sustain increased costs in order to continually evaluate our policies and processes and adapt to new requirements that are or become applicable to us as the regulatory environment relating to retailers’ and other companies’ obligation to protect personal information becomes stricter a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines other regulatory sanctions or government investigation and potentially to lawsuits brought by private individuals regulators or states’ attorney general such violation or perceived violation of privacy including improper collection use of sharing of personal information or failure to sufficiently disclose privacy practice can adversely affect the trust that customers employees and business partners have in us related to their personal information 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit cards debit cards credit accounts our private label and cobranded credit cards paypal trade credit gift cards cash consumer invoicing and physical bank checks and we may offer different payment options over time these payment options subject us to many compliance requirements including but not limited to compliance with payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements rules governing electronic funds transfers and payment card industry data security standards they also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks gift cards and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our 



customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

investmentrelated risks 

our strategic transactions involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous uncertainties and risks 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions joint ventures investments and other growth market and geographic expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales cost savings synergies and other various benefits our ability to deliver the expected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks including our ability to integrate personnel labor models financial it and other systems successfully disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management hiring additional management and other critical personnel and increasing the scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations additionally any impairment of goodwill or other assets acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any strategic transaction may materially reduce our earnings our shareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions we may not realize any anticipated benefits from such transactions we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business or joint venture and we may be exposed to litigation in connection with the strategic transaction further we may finance these strategic transactions by incurring additional debt which could increase leverage or impact our ability to access capital in the future 

operating internationally presents unique challenges including some that have required us to adapt our store operations merchandising marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada our business and results of operations could be negatively affected if we are unable to effectively address these challenges 

we operate stores in canada expanding and operating internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks of operation and expansion and slow the anticipated rate of expansion our future operating results in canada or in other countries or regions in which we may operate in the future could be negatively affected by a variety of factors including unfavorable political or economic factors adverse tax consequences volatility in foreign currency exchange rates increased difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights costs and difficulties of managing international operations challenges with identifying and contracting with local suppliers and other risks created as a result of differences in culture laws and regulations these factors could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

legal regulatory and other external risks 

the covid19 pandemic has affected and is expected to continue to affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic had a significant effect on us in 2020 and 2021 affecting our business operations demand for our products and services our costs of doing business availability of labor access to inventory supply chain operations our ability to predict future performance exposure to litigation and our financial condition among other things there is considerable uncertainty regarding the continuing effects of the pandemic including the possible recurrence of measures to try to contain the virus such as travel restrictions quarantines “shelterinplace” orders and various other restrictive measures 

in addition we have seen an increase in spending on home improvement products and projects during the pandemic as customers have focused on their homes and have spent less on other items like travel and entertainment as the pandemic begins to subside customers may shift their spending away from home improvement and back to other areas which may have an adverse impact on our sales 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic further impacts our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on numerous evolving factors which are uncertain and cannot be predicted including among others 

• the duration and scope of the pandemic and associated disruptions including whether there are additional “waves” or other continued periods of increases or spikes in the number of covid19 cases future variants or related strains of the virus in areas where we or our suppliers operate 



• the effects of current and future governmental and public responses to changing conditions 

• the availability of and prevalence of access to effective medical treatments and vaccines for covid19 and 

• evolving macroeconomic factors including general economic uncertainty unemployment rates and recessionary pressures 

any of the foregoing factors or other effects of the covid19 pandemic or another pandemic may result in adverse impacts to our business results of operations and financial condition the impacts of the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales 

many us and global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of slow economic growth or recession home price appreciation or decreasing housing turnover volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of borrowing to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending inflation and its impacts on discretionary spending and on our costs shortages and other disruptions in the labor supply consumer debt levels changes in tax rates and policy outbreak of pandemics fluctuations in fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters armed conflicts and acts of both domestic and international terrorism sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects adverse development in these factors could result in a decrease in home improvement activity which could reduce demand for our products and services 

our business could be affected by uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions including natural disasters and changes in climate as well as other catastrophic events which could impact our operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms fires floods tornadoes and earthquakes unseasonable or unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms or droughts whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate pandemics and public health concerns acts of terrorism or violence including active shooter situations civil unrest or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers’ disposable income particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance these types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities they can also disrupt or disable operations of stores support centers and portions of our supply chain and distribution network including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services in addition these events may affect our information systems resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores unseasonable unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation warm temperatures during the winter season or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures could render a portion of our inventory damaged or unsellable as a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events we may experience interruption to our operations increased costs or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

our business and operations are subject to risks related to the longterm effects of global climate change 

our business and operations are subject to inherent climaterelated risks these include both physical risks such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels and transition risks such as regulatory or technology changes which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable climate change extreme weather conditions wildfires droughts and rising sea levels may impact the areas in which the company’s operations and facilities are located and they could also affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience such events could result in an increase in our costs and expenses and harm our future revenue cash flows and financial performance government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs and other regulations affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability in addition we also use natural gas diesel fuel gasoline and electricity in our operations all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

our business is subject to a wide array of federal state and local laws and regulations in recent years a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies these laws and regulations and related interpretations and enforcement activity may change 



as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements collective bargaining units the classification of exempt and nonexempt employees the distinction between employees and contractors other wage labor or workplace regulations health care data privacy and cybersecurity the sale and pricing of some of our products transportation logistics international trade responsible sourcing supply chain transparency taxes unclaimed property sustainability the environment and climate change including energy costs and consumption could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery laws we could be subject to reputation and legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements negatively affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and in the future will become involved in lawsuits including consumer commercial employment tort and other litigation regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments furthermore defending against these proceedings may require a diversion of management’s attention and resources none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved individually or collectively are considered material 

the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices demand for our products and our sales 

prices of certain commodity products including lumber copper and other raw materials are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand labor costs competition market speculation government regulations tariffs and trade restrictions and periodic delays in delivery rapid and significant changes in commodity prices such as changes in lumber prices affect the demand for our products and our sales 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions 

we may be affected by higher rates of federal state or local tax imposed as a result of political developments or economic conditions which could affect our effective tax rate our effective tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by regulatory and legal changes the results of tax audits and examinations and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters all of which could negatively impact our business in addition changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations 

liquidity and access to capital rely on efficient rational and open capital markets and are dependent on lowe’s credit strength our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business financial performance and results of operations 

we have relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund our working capital needs our access to these markets depends on our strong credit ratings the overall condition of debt capital markets and our operating performance disruption in the financial markets or an erosion of our credit strength or declines on our credit rating could impact negatively our ability to meet capital requirements or fund working capital needs

performance overview 

net sales for fiscal 2021 increased 74 over fiscal year 2020 to 963 billion the increase in total sales was primarily driven by comparable sales growth comparable sales increased 69 over fiscal year 2020 driven by an 111 increase in comparable average ticket partially offset by a 42 decrease in comparable customer transactions net earnings for fiscal 2021 increased 447 to 84 billion diluted earnings per common share increased 553 in fiscal year 2021 to 1204 from 775 in 2020 included in the fiscal 2020 results are a 11 billion pretax loss on extinguishment of debt from cash tender offers to purchase and retire an aggregate principal amount of 30 billion in outstanding notes as well as operating costs related to the canada restructuring actions adjusting for these items diluted earnings per common share increased 359 to 1204 in 2021 from adjusted diluted earnings per common share of 886 in 2020 see the nongaap financial measures discussion

in the stores our disciplined focus on driving operating leverage through our perpetual productivity improvement ppi initiatives resulted in operational process improvements that reduced the amount of time our associates spend on tasking activities and can instead focus on serving our customers as part of these initiatives we recently launched a new store inventory management system that provides associates realtime visibility to inventory in their store and reduces nonproductive hours spent looking for product in addition we expanded our simplified user interface introduced earlier in the year across the sales floor which accelerates the associate training process and allows associates to focus on customer service while reducing customer wait times 

looking forward 

as part of our continued efforts around our total home strategy we are focused on further enhancing our omnichannel capabilities in 2022 across three key areas expanding our online assortment enhancing the user experience and improving 



fulfillment we will continue to expand our lowescom assortment to meet our customers’ design and lifestyle needs while at the same time enhancing the user experience with upgrades to the visualization and configuration tools we offer online as we head into spring we have leveraged our expanded supply chain network to position our instock inventory for our heavy selling season

return on invested capital roic is calculated using a nongaap financial measure management believes roic is a meaningful metric for analysts and investors as a measure of how effectively the company is using capital to generate profits although roic is a common financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating roic accordingly the method used by our management may differ from the methods used by other companies we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate roic before comparing its roic to ours 

we define roic as the rolling 12 months’ lease adjusted net operating profit after tax lease adjusted nopat divided by the average of current year and prior year ending debt and shareholders’ deficitequity lease adjusted nopat is a nongaap financial measure and net earnings is considered to be the most comparable gaap financial measure the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation of net earnings to lease adjusted nopat is as follows 



1 income tax adjustment is defined as net operating profit multiplied by the effective tax rate which was 247 246 and 239 for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

2 average debt and shareholders’ deficitequity is defined as average current year and prior year ending debt including current maturities shortterm borrowings and operating lease liabilities plus the average current year and prior year ending total shareholders’ deficitequity 

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

net sales – net sales increased 74 to 963 billion in 2021 the increase in total sales was driven by comparable sales growth comparable sales increased 69 over the same period driven by an 111 increase in comparable average ticket partially offset by a 42 decline in comparable customer transactions comparable sales change during each quarter of the 



fiscal year as reported were an increase of 259 in the first quarter decline of 17 in the second quarter increase of 22 in the third quarter and increase of 50 in the fourth quarter 

during 2021 we experienced comparable sales increases in eleven of fifteen product categories led by electrical lumber and flooring we delivered strong comparable sales in electrical and lumber due to strong unit demand from pro customers as well as unit price increases driven by inflation new product offerings drove strong sales in flooring led by vinyl flooring we experienced lower comparable sales in paint hardware and lighting due to cycling prior year diy demand at the onset of the covid19 pandemic geographically all fifteen us regions and canada experienced positive comparable sales 

gross margin – gross margin as a percentage of sales for 2021 increased 29 basis points compared to 2020 gross margin was positively impacted by approximately 65 basis points of total rate improvement driven by continued improvement in managing product costs and disciplined pricing strategies as well as approximately 25 basis points of leverage from higher credit revenue these benefits were partially offset by 35 basis points of deleverage due to product mix and 30 basis points of deleverage from supply chain costs 

sga – sga expense for 2021 leveraged 167 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2020 this was primarily driven by 115 basis points of leverage due to lower covid19 related expenses including additional compensation to hourly frontline associates emergency paid leave and cleaning costs 45 basis points of leverage in retail operating salaries due to increased sales and improved operating efficiencies as a result of our ppi initiatives and 30 basis points of leverage due to costs associated with the reset of the layout of our us stores in the prior year these benefits were partially offset by 20 basis points of deleverage due to the fourth quarter discretionary bonus to frontline associates 

depreciation and amortization – depreciation and amortization expense deleveraged 17 basis points for 2021 as a percentage of sales compared to 2020 driven by ongoing capital investments in store environment store equipment and technology projects property less accumulated depreciation decreased to 191 billion at january 28 2022 compared to 192 billion at january 29 2021 

interest – net – net interest expense is comprised of the following 



net interest expense in 2021 leveraged three basis points primarily as a result of increased sales in the current year offset by interest expense related to the issuance of 20 billion unsecured notes in march 2021 and 20 billion unsecured notes in september 2021 

loss on extinguishment of debt – during the third quarter of 2020 we repurchased and retired 30 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debt resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 11 billion 

income tax provision – our effective income tax rate was 247 in 2021 compared to 246 in 2020

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity 

cash flows from operations supplemented with our shortterm and longterm borrowings remain sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments to support longterm growth and return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases as of january 28 2022 we held 11 billion of cash and cash equivalents as well as 40 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facilities we believe these sources of liquidity and our continued access to the capital markets on both a shortterm and longterm basis as needed are adequate to fund our operations and investments to grow our business repay our debt as it becomes due pay dividends and fund our share repurchases over the next twelve months 

as of january 28 2022 our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments consist of leases longterm debt purchase obligations and letters of credit see note 6  note 8  and note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  “financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report for amounts outstanding related to leases longterm debt and commitments respectively as of january 28 2022 

cash flows provided by operating activities 



cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended january 28 2022 versus the year ended january 29 2021 was due primarily to changes in working capital partially offset by higher net earnings accounts payable increased for fiscal 2021 by 466 million compared to an increase of 32 billion in fiscal 2020 driving a reduction of 27 billion in operating cash flows for fiscal 2021 inventory decreased operating cash flow for fiscal 2021 by approximately 14 billion compared to a decrease of 30 billion for fiscal 2020 the increase in accounts payable and inventory in the prior year was driven by a ramp up in inventory purchase volume to meet sustained customer demand at the beginning of the covid19 pandemic in the current year we have continued to experience sustained demand levels and maintained a higher level of inventory and related accounts payable other operating liabilities decreased 570 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an increase of 813 million in fiscal 2020 the decrease in other operating liabilities in the current year compared to the prior year is primarily driven by covidrelated accrued discretionary compensation for hourly associates in the prior year and timing of tax payments 

cash flows used in investing activities 



net cash used in investing activities primarily consists of transactions related to capital expenditures 



capital expenditures 

our capital expenditures generally consist of investments in our strategic initiatives to enhance our ability to serve customers improve existing stores and support expansion plans capital expenditures were 19 billion in 2021 and 18 billion in 2020 the following table provides the allocation of capital expenditures for 2021 and 2020

3 represents expenditures primarily related to land purchases buildings and personal property for new store projects and new corporate facilities projects as well as expenditures related to our international operations 

for 2022 our capital expenditures forecast is approximately 20 billion the following table provides the allocation of our fiscal 2022 capital expenditures forecast 



cash flows used in financing activities 



net cash used in financing activities primarily consist of transactions related to our debt share repurchases and cash dividend payments 

total debt 

in 2021 we issued 40 billion of unsecured notes this is comprised of 20 billion of unsecured notes issued in march 2021 and 20 billion of unsecured notes issued in september 2021 the proceeds of which were designated for general corporate purposes in april 2021 we also entered into a 10 billion unsecured 364day term loan facility the 2021 term loan which was repaid during fiscal 2021 in 2021 we also paid approximately 10 billion to retire scheduled debts at maturity 

in december 2021 we entered into a 20 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving third amended and restated credit agreement the third amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of banks the third amended and restated credit agreement amends and restates the company’s amended and restated credit agreement dated september 10 2018 the second amended and restated credit agreement to among other things i extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to december 2026 and ii increase the aggregate availability to a total of 20 billion 

also in december 2021 we amended the fiveyear unsecured revolving credit agreement dated march 23 2020 the 2020 credit agreement with a syndicate of banks the amendment among other things increased the availability of the unsecured revolving credit agreement to 20 billion maturing in march 2025 subject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the 2020 credit agreement and the third amended and restated credit agreement the company may increase the combined aggregate availability of both agreements by an additional 10 billion 



the third amended and restated credit agreement and the 2020 credit agreement collectively the credit agreements support our commercial paper program the amount available to be drawn under the credit agreements is reduced by the amount of borrowings under our commercial paper program there were no outstanding borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program the 2020 credit agreement or the third amended and restated credit agreement as of january 28 2022 there were no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program the 2020 credit agreement or the second amended and restated credit agreement as of january 29 2021 total combined availability under the 2020 credit agreement and the third amended and restated credit agreement as of january 28 2022 was 40 billion 

the third amended and restated credit agreement and the 2020 credit agreement contain customary representations warranties and covenants we were in compliance with those covenants at january 28 2022 

our ratio of debt to capital shareholder’s deficitequity plus debt was 1242 and 938 as of january 28 2022 and january 29 2021 respectively 

the following table includes additional information related to our debt for 2021 and 2020 



share repurchases 

we have an ongoing share repurchase program authorized by the company’s board of directors that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private offmarket transactions we also withhold shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding liabilities on sharebased payments shares repurchased are returned to authorized and unissued status the following table provides on a settlement date basis the total number of shares repurchased average price paid per share and the total amount paid for share repurchases for 2021 and 2020 



as of january 28 2022 we had 197 billion remaining under our share repurchase program with no expiration date for 2022 we expect to repurchase shares totaling approximately 120 billion subject to market conditions 

dividends 

in the third quarter of 2021 we increased our quarterly dividend payment by 33 to 080 per share our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared the following table provides additional information related to our dividend payments for 2021 and 2020 



capital resources 

we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both shortterm and longterm bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new longterm debt the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be 



adversely affected however by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard  poor’s sp and moody’s as of march 21 2022 which is disclosed to provide an enhanced understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds our debt ratings have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 



there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price in addition we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate significant cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory 

description 

we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels sales trends and historical experience during 2021 our reserve decreased approximately 14 million to 168 million as of january 28 2022 

we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories this reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories during 2021 the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately 49 million to 414 million as of january 28 2022 in response to higher volumes and estimated shrinkage rates based on results from previous physical inventories 

in addition we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business principally as a result of purchase volumes sales early payments or promotions of vendors’ products generally these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor’s product many of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter the funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned as the related inventory is sold the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors’ products are recorded as an offset to the related expense 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions however changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves likewise changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and results of physical inventories we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value 

for vendor funds we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are 



appropriately recorded amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves however it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves a 10 change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 13 million for 2021 a 10 change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 31 million for 2021 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective longterm estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 

longlived asset impairment 

description 

we review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable when evaluating locations for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead 

we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to longlived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location’s assets may not be recoverable for operating locations our primary indicator that assets may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a twelve month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment including individual locations’ execution of their operating plans and local market conditions including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe’s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location’s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets the carrying value of a location’s asset group includes inventory property operating and finance lease rightofuse assets and operating liabilities including inventory payables salaries payable and operating lease liabilities financial and nonoperating liabilities are excluded from the carrying value of the asset group when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location management makes assumptions incorporating local market conditions about key store variables including sales growth rates gross margin and controllable expenses such as store payroll and operating expense as well as asset residual values or lease rates operating lease payments are included in the projected future cash flows financing lease payments are excluded from the projected future cash flows an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 

we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations which requires discounting projected future cash flows this involves making assumptions regarding both a location’s future cash flows as described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours 

we use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for closure this involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated the information includes comparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these assets 



judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows including estimated sales margin and controllable expenses assumptions about market performance for operating locations and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 longlived asset impairment recorded within selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings was immaterial we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values our actual impairment losses could vary from our estimated impairment losses in the event that our estimates vary from actual results we may record additional impairment losses which could be material to our results of operations 

selfinsurance 

description 

we are selfinsured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation automobile general and product liability extended protection plans and certain medical and dental claims we have excess insurance coverage above certain retention amounts to limit exposure from single events and earnings volatility our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable is limited to 2 million per occurrence involving workers’ compensation 10 million per occurrence involving general or product liability and 10 million per occurrence involving automobile we do not have any excess insurance coverage for selfinsured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims selfinsurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for selfinsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during 2021 our selfinsurance liabilities increased approximately 23 million to 11 billion as of january 28 2022 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposures including payroll sales and vehicle units as well as the frequency lag and severity of claims 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded selfinsurance liabilities a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 84 million for 2021 a 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately 23 million for 2021 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

we use forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes in future debt issuances the fair value of our derivative financial instruments as of january 28 2022 was not material fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and consists primarily of fixedrate instruments therefore providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instruments 



commodity price risk 

we purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control which could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition andor results of operations we believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices the selling prices of these commodity products are influenced in part by the market price we pay and our competitive environment 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition and result of operations

competitive operational and reputational risks 

we may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address the changing shopping habits demands and demographics of our customers or realize the intended benefits of organizational change initiatives 

the home improvement retail environment like the retail environment generally is rapidly evolving and adapting our business concept to respond to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and their changing demographics is critical to our future success our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to the economic social style and other trends that affect demographic and consumer preferences in a variety of our merchandise categories and service offerings customers’ expectations about how they wish to research purchase and receive products and services have also evolved it is difficult to predict the mix of products and services that our customers will demand further we have a store base that requires maintenance investment and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire our capital investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect failure to identify such trends adapt our business concept improve and maintain our stores and implement change growth and productivity initiatives successfully could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for the home improvement products and services we sell the rate of growth of our business our market share and results of operations 

we may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on omnichannel sales and marketing presence if we fail to deliver the capabilities required to execute on them 

our interactions with customers have evolved into an omnichannel experience as they increasingly are using computers tablets mobile phones and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business omnichannel retail is quickly evolving and we must anticipate and meet our customers’ expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors our customerfacing technology systems must appeal to our customers function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience the success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and changing demographics have required us to and will continue to require us to deliver large complex programs requiring integrated planning initiative prioritization and program sequencing these initiatives have required and will continue to require new competencies in many positions and our management employees and contractors have had to and will need to continue to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies products or services could result in the 

value of those investments being written down or written off in addition to support our strategic initiatives and the related technology investments needed to implement our strategic investments we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals including technology professionals the market for these professionals is increasingly competitive our results of operations financial condition or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we fail to provide a consistent experience for our customers regardless of sales channel if our technology systems do not meet our customers’ expectations if we are unable to counteract new developments and innovations implemented by our competitors or if we are unable to attract retain and manage the talent succession of additional personnel at various levels of the company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic initiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly changing retail environment 

we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively or if they develop a substantially more effective or lower cost means of meeting customer needs resulting in a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the principal competitive factors in our industry include convenience customer service quality and price of merchandise and services instock levels and merchandise assortment and presentation we face growing competition from online and omnichannel retailers who have a similar product or service offering customers are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine realtime product availability and price using digital tools further online and omnichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services as customers are increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping and we must make investments to keep up with our customers’ evolving shopping preferences our ability to be competitive on delivery times delivery costs and delivery options depends on many factors including successful implementation and the continued maintenance of our initiatives related to supply chain transformation our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our results 

if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists with expanded skill sets or corporate support staff with the capabilities of delivering on strategic objectives we could lose sales to our competitors and our labor costs resulting from operations or the execution of corporate strategies could be negatively affected 

our customers whether they are homeowners renters or commercial businesses expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide we compete with other retailers for many of our sales associates and specialists and we invest significantly in them with respect to training and development to strive for high engagement increasingly our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets including in some instances the ability to do inhome or telephone sales we may be unable to attract and retain a sufficiently diverse workforce that can deliver relevant culturally competent and differentiated experiences for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers additionally in order to deliver on the omnichannel expectations of our customers we rely on the specialized training and capabilities of corporate support staff which are broadly sought after by our competitors if we are unable to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our results of operations could be negatively affected furthermore our ability to meet our labor needs particularly in a competitive labor market while controlling our costs is subject to a variety of external factors including prevailing wage rates the availability of and competition for talent health care and other benefit costs our brand image and reputation changing demographics and the adoption of new or revised legislation or regulations governing immigration employment labor relations minimum wage and health care benefits periodically we are subject to labor organizing efforts and if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect how we operate our business and adversely affect our labor costs and our ability to retain a qualified workforce 

positively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is critical to our business success and if our public image and reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers vendors and store associates and specialists and consequently our business and results of operations 

our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at lowe’s our vendors want to do business with lowe’s and our sales associates and specialists want to work for lowe’s we must continue to manage preserve and grow lowe’s public image and reputation any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence reduce demand for our products and services affect our relationships with current and future vendors impact our results of operations and affect our ability to retain and recruit store associates and specialists the significant expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents 

additionally our proprietary rights in our trademarks trade names service marks domain names copyrights patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business we may not be able to prevent or even 

discover every instance of unauthorized third party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights our business could be adversely affected 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales profitability cash flows and financial condition 

product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe’s and our brand image if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement action and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities as a result lowe’s reputation as a retailer of highquality products and services including both national and lowe’s private brands could suffer and impact customer loyalty 

supply chain and thirdparty risks 

if our domestic or international supply chain or our fulfillment network for our products is ineffective or disrupted for any reason including the covid19 pandemic or if these operations are subject to trade policy changes or additional tariffs our results of operations could be adversely affected 

circumstances surrounding and related to the covid19 pandemic have created unprecedented impacts on the global supply chain we source stock and sell products from domestic and international vendors and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success impacts related to the covid19 pandemic are placing strains on the domestic and international supply chain that may negatively affect the flow or availability of our products this can result in higher outofstock inventory positions due to difficulties in timely obtaining products from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products as well as transportation of those products to our distribution centers and stores which could negatively affect our business and financial results even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products they may cost more which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition 

we source a large number of our products from foreign manufacturers with china being the dominant import source the changes in certain tax and trade policies tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries enacted under the prior us administration increased the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the us which represents a large percentage of our overall merchandise it remains unclear how tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations may change under the new us administration which could adversely affect our business results of operations effective income tax rate liquidity and net income in addition other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in us trade policy and regulations already enacted or that may be enacted in the future the degree of our exposure is dependent on among other things the type of goods rates imposed and timing of tariffs the impact to our business including net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors while these potential impacts are uncertain they could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

financial instability among key vendors political instability and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain changes in the total costs in our supply chain fuel labor and currency exchange rates port labor disputes and security the outbreak of pandemics weatherrelated events natural disasters work stoppages shipping capacity restraints changes in trade policy retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the united states or a major source country tariffs or duties fluctuations in currency exchange rates and transport availability capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs additionally as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience delays in inventory increased delivery costs or merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 

our inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national and international brand names we also have relationships with certain suppliers to enable us to sell proprietary products which differentiate us from other retailers the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business many of these vendors and service providers have certain products or specialized skills needed to support our business concept and our strategies if these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or are unable to perform as expected or if we fail to manage them properly or we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to replace them 

failures relating to our thirdparty installer program or by our thirdparty installers could result in increased operational and legal risks and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we contract with thirdparty installers to provide installation services to our customers and as the general contractor we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors including certain licensing and permitting requirements and those relating to the quality and performance of our thirdparty installers our or our thirdparty installers’ failures to effectively manage such requirements and internal processes regarding installation services could result in lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could negatively affect our business 

technology and cybersecurity risks 

our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain improve upgrade and expand those systems 

our efforts to provide an omnichannel experience for our customers include investing in maintaining and making ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as sales inventory replenishment merchandise ordering project design and execution transportation receipt processing and fulfillment our systems are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events power outages viruses malicious attacks and telecommunications failures and as a result we may incur significant expense data loss as well as an erosion of customer confidence additionally we continually make investments in our systems which may introduce disruption our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain improve upgrade and expand those systems 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omnichannel sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

access to the internet from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them our websites including lowescom and lowesforproscom are a sales channel for our products and are also a method of making product project and other relevant information available to our customers that impacts our instore sales additionally we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire inform crosssell establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service ransomware or other cyberattacks or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of lowe’s as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services 

our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer employee vendor or company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems assets and such information 

cyberattacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving and high profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major us companies including several large retailers despite widespread recognition of the cyberattack threat and improved data protection methods as with many other retailers we collect process transmit and store certain personal information about our customers employees and vendors as well as confidential sensitive proprietary and business personal and payment card information additionally we use thirdparty service providers for certain services such as authentication content delivery backoffice support and other functions and we provide such thirdparty service providers with personal and other confidential information necessary for the services concerned despite our continued vigilance and investment in information security we like others in our industry are subject to the risk that unauthorized parties will attempt to gain access to our systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates third party providers or vendors and we or our thirdparty service providers cannot 

guarantee that we or they are able to adequately anticipate or prevent a future breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized access to destruction misuse or release of personal information or other sensitive data it can be difficult to preempt or detect everevolving forms of cyberattacks if a ransomware attack occurs it is possible that we could be prevented from accessing our own data our information security or our service providers’ information security may also be compromised because of human errors including by employees or system errors our systems and our service providers’ systems are additionally vulnerable to a number of other causes such as critical infrastructure outages computer viruses technology system failures catastrophic events or cyberattacks including the use of malicious codes worms phishing and ransomware in the event that our systems are breached or damaged for any reason we may also suffer loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to our business operations while such breach or damage is being remedied should these events occur the unauthorized disclosure loss or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation drive existing and potential customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions or potential liability including possible litigation and punitive damages a security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of data from our information systems or our thirdparty service providers’ information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks and require dedication of substantial resources to manage the aftermath of such a breach data privacy and cybersecurity laws in the united states and internationally are constantly changing and the implementation of these laws has become more complex 

in the united states alone we may be subject to regulation at both the federal and state level f or example the california consumer privacy act of 2018 grants california consumers certain rights over their personal information and imposes stringent requirements on the collection use and sharing of “personal information” of california consumers other us states are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal information and the us federal government is also considering federal privacy legislation in order to maintain our compliance with such laws as they come to fruition we may sustain increased costs in order to continually evaluate our policies and processes and adapt to new requirements that are or become applicable to us as the regulatory environment relating to retailers’ and other companies’ obligation to protect personal information becomes stricter a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines other regulatory sanctions or government investigation and potentially to lawsuits brought by private individuals regulators or states’ attorney general

investmentrelated risks 

our strategic transactions involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous uncertainties and risks 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions joint ventures investments and other growth market and geographic expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales cost savings synergies and other various benefits our ability to deliver the expected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks including our ability to integrate personnel labor models financial it and other systems successfully disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management hiring additional management and other critical personnel and increasing the scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations additionally any impairment of goodwill or other assets acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any

operating internationally presents unique challenges including some that have required us to adapt our store operations merchandising marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada our business and results of operations could be negatively affected if we are unable to effectively address these challenges 

we operate stores in canada expanding and operating internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks of operation and expansion and slow the anticipated rate of expansion our future operating results in canada or in other countries or regions in which we may operate in the future could be negatively affected by a variety of factors including unfavorable political or economic factors adverse tax consequences volatility in foreign currency exchange rates increased difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights costs and difficulties of managing international operations challenges with identifying and contracting with local suppliers and other risks created as a result of differences in culture laws and regulations these factors could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

legal regulatory and other external risks 

the covid19 pandemic has affected and is expected to continue to affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile and have affected and are expected to continue to affect our business operations demand for our products and services our costs of doing business availability of labor access to inventory supply chain operations our ability to predict future performance exposure to litigation and our financial condition among other things  there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus such as travel restrictions quarantines “shelterinplace” orders and various other restrictive measures 

at the onset of the pandemic we implemented a number of measures to facilitate a safer store environment in addition we provided expanded associate benefits to provide additional paid time off special payments to hourly associates temporary wage increases and other benefits these measures have increased our operating expenses additionally in response to the uncertainties surrounding the covid19 pandemic we took proactive steps to further enhance our liquidity position by temporarily suspending our share repurchase program which was later reinstated increasing the capacity of our revolving credit facilities and the associated commercial paper program as well as issuing senior notes in march 2020 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic further impacts our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on numerous evolving factors which are uncertain and cannot be predicted including 

• the duration and scope of the pandemic and associated disruptions including whether there are additional “waves” or other continued periods of increases or spikes in the number of covid19 cases future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas where we or our suppliers operate 

• the effects of current and future governmental and public responses to changing conditions 

• evolving macroeconomic factors including general economic uncertainty unemployment rates and recessionary pressures 

• the financial condition and purchasing power of our customers 

• the ability of the third parties on which we rely including our suppliers and other external business partners to meet their obligations to the company or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties 

• unknown consequences on our business performance and strategic initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response 

• the availability of and prevalence of access to effective medical treatments and vaccines for covid19 

• volatility in the credit and financial markets during and after the pandemic 

• the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides and 

• the longterm impact of the pandemic on our business including consumer behaviors 

any of the foregoing factors or other effects of the covid19 pandemic or another pandemic may result in adverse impacts to our business results of operations and financial condition the impacts of the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales 

many us and global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of slow economic growth or recession decreasing housing turnover or home price appreciation volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of borrowing to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending high rates of unemployment consumer debt levels outbreak of pandemics fluctuations in fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters and acts of both domestic and international terrorism sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects adverse development in these factors could result in a decrease in home improvement activity which could reduce demand for our products and services 

our business could be affected by uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions including natural disasters and changes in climate which could impact our operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms fires floods tornadoes and earthquakes unseasonable or unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms or droughts whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers’ disposable income particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance these types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities they can also disrupt or disable operations of stores support centers and portions of our supply chain and distribution network including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services in addition these events may affect our information systems resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores as a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events we may experience interruption to our operations increased costs or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations 

our business is subject to a wide array of federal state and local laws and regulations in recent years a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal state and local agencies these laws and regulations and related interpretations and enforcement activity may change as a result of a variety of factors including political economic or social events changes in expanded enforcement of or adoption of new federal state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage requirements collective bargaining units the classification of exempt and nonexempt employees the distinction between employees and contractors other wage labor or workplace regulations health care data privacy and cybersecurity the sale and pricing of some of our products transportation logistics international trade supply chain transparency taxes unclaimed property energy costs and consumption or environmental matters could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery laws we could be subject to reputation and legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements negatively affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and in the future will become involved in lawsuits including consumer commercial employment tort and other litigation regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments furthermore defending against these proceedings may require a diversion of management’s attention and resources none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved individually or collectively are considered material 

liquidity and access to capital rely on efficient rational and open capital markets and are dependent on lowe’s credit strength our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business financial performance and results of operations 

we have relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund our working capital needs our access to these markets depends on our strong credit ratings the overall condition of debt capital markets and our operating performance disruption in the financial markets or an erosion of our credit strength or declines on our credit rating could impact negatively our ability to meet capital requirements or fund working capital needs

in 2020 we experienced unprecedented customer demand as the consumer mindset turned its focus to the function and enjoyment of their home during the covid19 pandemic the home has become a residence a home school a home office and the primary location for recreation and entertainment due to our execution of the company’s retail fundamentals strategy announced in 2018 which focused on merchandising excellence supply chain transformation operational efficiency and customer engagement we leveraged our improved operating capabilities to quickly respond to the global health crisis and meet customer demands 

the covid19 pandemic changed the way customers shop with lowe’s in an effort to enhance our omnichannel capabilities and to offer options to meet our customer’s needs we rapidly rolled out curbside pickup in the first quarter we then launched mobile checkin for curbside pickup along with an internal order picking app to improve associates’ speed and accuracy in fulfilling orders and began the launch of touchless buy online pickup in store bopis lockers we also continue to enhance our mobile app to improve the customer pickup experience including geofencing technology that alerts our stores when customers are on their way to pick up their orders in addition we completed the replatforming of lowescom to the cloud which greatly improved site stability and functionality allowing us to achieve tripledigit online sales growth for the year 

to provide customers with a more intuitive shopping experience and better align our product adjacencies especially for pro customers we made a significant merchandising investment to reset the layout of our us stores us stores reset the us stores reset provides a faster shopping experience increases localized product assortments by eliminating unproductive bays 

which opens up space for new products better tailored to the local market and drives more transactions by moving the basketbuilding category of cleaning products to the main power aisle of the store the company incurred approximately 260 million of incremental expense in 2020 which is reflected within selling general and administrative sga expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings with approximately 95 of the resets complete as of the end of the fiscal year

the following table sets forth key metrics utilized by management in assessing business performance this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements 

beginning on february 1 2020 the company changed the basis in which it presents the comparable sales metric the current metric is presented on a transacted basis when tender is accepted from a customer prior to this change the company’s comparable sales metric was based on when control of the good or service passed to the customer which included timing impacts of deferred sales the purpose of the change was to align the metric with how the lowe’s management team evaluates the business throughout the year and views performance relative to peers for the fiscal year ended january 29 2021 the impact of excluding deferred sales increased the comparable sales metric by 62 basis points for the fiscal year ended january 31 2020 the impact of excluding deferred sales decreased the comparable sales metric by 7 basis points for the fiscal year ended february 1 2019 the impact of excluding deferred sales decreased the comparable sales metric by 20 basis points the comparable sales metric for the fiscal years ended january 31 2020 and february 1 2019 has been recast to conform to the current year presentation

nongaap financial measures 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

adjusted diluted earnings per share is considered a nongaap financial measure management believes this nongaap financial measure provides useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating what management considers the company’s core financial performance adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of certain discrete items not contemplated in the company’s business outlooks for 2020 and 2019 unless otherwise noted the income tax effect of these adjustments is calculated using the marginal rates for the respective periods

return on invested capital 

return on invested capital roic is calculated using a nongaap financial measure management believes roic is a meaningful metric for analysts and investors as a measure of how effectively the company is using capital to generate profits although roic is a common financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating roic accordingly the method used by our management may differ from the methods used by other companies we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate roic before comparing its roic to ours 

we define roic as the rolling 12 months’ lease adjusted net operating profit after tax lease adjusted nopat divided by the average of current year and prior year ending debt and equity lease adjusted nopat is a nongaap financial measure and net earnings is considered to be the most comparable gaap financial measure the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation of net earnings to lease adjusted nopat is as follows 



1 income tax adjustment is defined as net operating profit multiplied by the effective tax rate which was 246 239 and 318 for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

2 average debt and equity is defined as average current year and prior year ending debt including current maturities shortterm borrowings and operating lease liabilities plus the average current year and prior year ending total equity

significant customer demand and operating performance for the fiscal year drove a substantial increase in cash flows from operations these increases supplemented with our shortterm and longterm borrowings have provided ample liquidity to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments in our omnichannel capabilities to support longterm growth and return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases as of january 29 2021 we held 47 billion of cash and cash equivalents as well as 3 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facilities we believe that our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our operations and investments to grow our business repay our debt as it becomes due pay dividends and fund our share repurchases over the next 12 months 

cash flows provided by operating activities 



cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended january 29 2021 versus the year ended january 31 2020 was due primarily to higher net earnings and changes in working capital accounts payable increased for fiscal 2020 by 32 billion compared to a decrease of 637 million in fiscal 2019 driving an additional 38 billion in operating cash flows for fiscal 2020 the increase in accounts payable was driven by higher sustained inventory purchase volume in 2020 as compared to 2019 other operating liabilities increased 813 million for fiscal 2020 compared to a decrease of 639 million in fiscal 2019 the increase in other operating liabilities in the current year is primarily driven by increases in accrued compensation and employee benefits and increased accrued payroll taxes due to the deferral of qualifying employer payroll taxes in accordance with the coronavirus aid relief and economic securities act the cares act inventory decreased operating cash flow for fiscal 2020 by approximately 30 billion compared to a decrease of 600 million for fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher inventory purchases to meet sustained customer demand in 2020 as well as buildup of inventory for the spring selling season 

cash flows used in investing activities 



net cash used in investing activities primarily consists of transactions related to capital expenditures 

capital expenditures 

our capital expenditures generally consist of investments in our strategic initiatives to enhance our ability to serve customers improve existing stores and support expansion plans capital expenditures were 18 billion in 2020 15 billion in 2019 and 12 billion in 2018 the following table provides the allocation of capital expenditures for 2020 2019 and 2018

3 represents expenditures primarily related to land purchases buildings and personal property for new store projects and new corporate facilities projects as well as expenditures related to our international operations 

our 2021 capital expenditures forecast is approximately 20 billion the following table provides the allocation of our fiscal 2021 capital expenditures forecast 



cash flows used in financing activities 



net cash used in financing activities primarily consist of transactions related to our shortterm borrowings longterm debt share repurchases and cash dividend payments 

shortterm borrowing facilities 

in march 2020 we entered into a 102 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit agreement the 2020 credit agreement with a syndicate of banks in addition we have a 198 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving second amended and restated 

credit agreement the second amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of banks subject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the 2020 credit agreement and the second amended and restated credit agreement the company may increase the combined aggregate availability of both agreements by an additional 520 million 

in january 2020 we entered into a 1 billion unsecured 364day term loan facility the “term loan” the company repaid the term loan during fiscal 2020 

in september 2019 we entered into a 250 million unsecured 364day credit agreement the 2019 credit agreement with a syndicate of banks in connection with the 2020 credit agreement the company refinanced the 2019 credit agreement and terminated any commitments under the 2019 credit agreement as of march 23 2020 

the 2020 credit agreement and the second amended and restated credit agreement support our commercial paper program the amount available to be drawn under the 2020 credit agreement and the second amended and restated credit agreement is reduced by the amount of borrowings under our commercial paper program there were no outstanding borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program the 2020 credit agreement or the second amended and restated credit agreement as of january 29 2021 outstanding borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program were 941 million with a weighted average interest rate of 210 as of january 31 2020 there was 10 billion in outstanding borrowings under the term loan with a weighted average interest rate of 229 and no borrowings outstanding under the second amended and restated credit agreement or the 2019 credit agreement as of january 31 2020 total combined availability under the 2020 credit agreement and the second amended and restated credit agreement as of january 29 2021 was 30 billion 

our commercial paper program along with cash flows generated from operations is typically utilized during our fourth fiscal quarter to build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season the following table includes additional information related to our shortterm borrowings for 2020 2019 and 2018 



the second amended and restated credit agreement and the 2020 credit agreement contain customary representations warranties and covenants we were in compliance with those covenants at january 29 2021 

longterm debt 

the following table includes additional information related to the company’s longterm debt for 2020 2019 and 2018 



in 2020 we issued 80 billion of unsecured notes this is comprised of 40 billion of unsecured notes issued in march 2020 to finance current year maturities and for other general corporate purposes and 40 billion of unsecured notes issued in october 2020 to fund the 2020 cash tender offers to purchase existing unsecured notes and for other general corporate purposes we completed the tender offers in october 2020 in which we purchased and retired an aggregate principal amount of 30 billion of our higher coupon notes prior to maturity to take advantage of a favorable interest rate environment to reduce our longterm interest expense as part of this transaction we incurred 11 billion of debt extinguishment costs which included premium to noteholders and the cost of reverse treasury lock derivative contracts associated with the tender offers in 2020 we paid 500 million to repay scheduled longterm debts at maturity 

in 2019 we issued 30 billion of unsecured notes to finance 2019 maturities and for other general corporate purposes which included share repurchases capital expenditures strategic investments and working capital needs in 2019 we paid approximately 11 billion to retire scheduled debts at maturity 

our ratio of debt to capital equity plus debt was 938 and 907 as of january 29 2021 and january 31 2020 respectively 

share repurchases 

we have an ongoing share repurchase program authorized by the company’s board of directors that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private offmarket transactions we also withhold shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding liabilities shares repurchased are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status the following table provides on a settlement date basis the total number of shares repurchased average price paid per share and the total amount paid for share repurchases for 2020 2019 and 2018 



as of january 29 2021 we had 197 billion remaining under our share repurchase program with no expiration date we expect to repurchase shares totaling approximately 90 billion in 2021 

dividends 

in 2020 we increased our quarterly dividend payment by 9 to 060 per share our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared the following table provides additional information related to our dividend payments for 2020 2019 and 2018 



capital resources 

we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both shortterm and longterm bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new longterm debt the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected however by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard  poor’s sp and moody’s as of march 22 2021 which is disclosed to provide an enhanced understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds our debt ratings have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 



there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price in addition we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate significant cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at january 29 2021 



1 amounts do not include taxes common area maintenance insurance or contingent rent because these amounts have historically been insignificant 

2 amounts include imputed interest 

3 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable are legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase obligations include firm commitments related to certain marketing and information technology programs as well as purchases of merchandise inventory 

4 letters of credit are issued primarily for insurance and construction contracts 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory 

description 

we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels sales trends and historical experience during 2020 our reserve increased approximately 77 million to 182 million as of january 29 2021 

we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories due to covid19 the company did not complete physical inventories for approximately 7 of retail locations originally planned in 2020 for those locations where physical inventories were not completed the company recorded an immaterial adjustment for its estimate of shrinkage as of january 29 2021 and these locations will have physical inventories completed by march 31 2021 during 2020 the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately 121 million to 365 million as of january 29 2021 in response to higher volumes and estimated shrinkage rates based on results from previous physical inventories 

in addition we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business principally as a result of purchase volumes sales early payments or promotions of vendors’ products generally these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor’s product many of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter the funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned as the related inventory is sold the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors’ products are recorded as an offset to the related expense 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions however changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves likewise changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and results of physical inventories we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value 

for vendor funds we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves however it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves a 10 change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 14 million for 2020 a 10 change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 27 million for 2020 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective longterm estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 

longlived asset impairment 

description 

we review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable when evaluating locations for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead 

we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to longlived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location’s asset may not be recoverable for operating locations our primary indicator that assets may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a 12month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment including individual locations’ execution of their operating plans and local market conditions including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe’s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location’s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets the carrying value of a location’s asset group includes inventory property operating and finance lease rightofuse assets and operating liabilities including inventory payables salaries payable and operating lease liabilities financial and nonoperating liabilities are excluded from the carrying 

value of the asset group when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location management makes assumptions incorporating local market conditions about key store variables including sales growth rates gross margin and controllable expenses such as store payroll and operating expense as well as asset residual values or lease rates operating lease payments are included in the projected future cash flows financing lease payments are excluded from the projected future cash flows an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 

we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations which requires discounting projected future cash flows this involves making assumptions regarding both a location’s future cash flows as described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours 

we use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for closure this involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated the information includes comparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these assets 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows including estimated sales margin and controllable expenses assumptions about market performance for operating locations and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 longlived asset impairment recorded within selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings was immaterial we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values our actual impairment losses could vary from our estimated impairment losses in the event that our estimates vary from actual results we may record additional impairment losses which could be material to our results of operations 

selfinsurance 

description 

we are selfinsured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation automobile general and product liability extended protection plans and certain medical and dental claims we have excess insurance coverage above certain retention amounts to limit exposure from single events and earnings volatility our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable is limited to 2 million per occurrence involving workers’ compensation 10 million per occurrence involving general or product liability and 10 million per occurrence involving automobile we do not have any excess insurance coverage for selfinsured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims selfinsurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for selfinsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during 2020 our selfinsurance liabilities decreased approximately 11 million to 11 billion as of january 29 2021 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposures including payroll sales and vehicle units as well as the frequency lag and severity of claims 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded selfinsurance liabilities a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 82 million for 2020 a 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately 23 million for 2020 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

we use forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes in future debt issuances the fair value of our derivative financial instruments as of january 29 2021 was not material fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and consists primarily of fixedrate instruments therefore providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instruments 

commodity price risk 

we purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control which could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition andor results of operations we believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices the selling prices of these commodity products are influenced in part by the market price we pay and our competitive environment 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition and result of operations 




 item 9  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a  controls and procedures 

the company’s management with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rule 13a15e promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act based upon their evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the company files or submits under the exchange act with the securities and exchange commission the sec 1 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and 2 is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

we may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address the changing shopping habits demands and demographics of our customers or realize the intended benefits of organizational change initiatives 

the home improvement retail environment like the retail environment generally is rapidly evolving and adapting our business concept to respond to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and their changing demographics is critical to our future success our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to the economic social style and other trends that affect demographic and consumer preferences in a variety of our merchandise categories and service offerings customers’ expectations about how they wish to research purchase and receive products and services have also evolved it is difficult to predict the mix of products and services that our customers will demand failure to identify such trends adapt our business concept and implement change growth and productivity initiatives successfully could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for the home improvement products and services we sell the rate of growth of our business our market share and results of operations 

we may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on omnichannel sales and marketing presence if we fail to deliver the capabilities required to execute on them 

our interactions with customers have evolved into an omnichannel experience as they increasingly are using computers tablets mobile phones and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business omnichannel retail is quickly evolving and we must anticipate and meet our customers’ expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors our customerfacing technology systems must appeal to our customers function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience the success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and changing demographics will require us to deliver large complex programs requiring integrated planning initiative prioritization and program sequencing these initiatives will require new competencies in many positions and our management employees and contractors will have to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities to the extent they are unable 

or unwilling to make these transformational changes we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies products or 

services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off in addition to support our strategic 

initiatives and the related technology investments needed to implement our strategic investments we must attract and retain a 

large number of skilled professionals including technology professionals the market for these professionals is increasingly 

competitive our results of operations financial condition or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we fail to provide a consistent experience for our customers regardless of sales channel if our technology systems do not meet our customers’ expectations if we are unable to counteract new developments and innovations implemented by our competitors or if we are unable to attract retain and manage the talent succession of additional personnel at various levels of the company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic initiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly changing retail environment 

our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer employee vendor or company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems assets and such information 

cyberattacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving and high profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major us companies including several large retailers despite widespread recognition of the cyberattack threat and improved data protection methods as with many other retailers we collect process transmit and store certain personal information about our customers employees and vendors as well as confidential sensitive proprietary and business personal and payment card information additionally we use thirdparty service providers for certain services such as authentication content delivery backoffice support and other functions and we provide such thirdparty service providers with personal and other confidential information necessary for the services concerned despite our continued vigilance and investment in information security we like others in our industry are subject to the risk that unauthorized parties will attempt to gain access to our systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates third party providers or vendors and we or our thirdparty service providers cannot guarantee that we or they are able to adequately anticipate or prevent a future breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized access to destruction misuse or release of personal information or other sensitive data it can be difficult to preempt or detect everevolving forms of cyberattacks if a ransomware attack occurs it is possible that we could be prevented from accessing our own data our information security or our service providers’ information security may also be compromised because of human errors including by employees or system errors our systems and our service providers’ systems are additionally vulnerable to a number of other causes such as critical infrastructure outages computer viruses technology system failures catastrophic events or cyberattacks including the use of malicious codes worms phishing and ransomware in the event that our systems are breached or damaged for any reason we may also suffer loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to our business operations while such breach or damage is being remedied should these events occur the unauthorized disclosure loss or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation drive existing and potential customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions or potential liability including possible litigation and punitive damages a security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of data from our information systems or our thirdparty service providers’ information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks and require dedication of substantial resources to manage the aftermath of such a breach data privacy and cybersecurity laws in the united states and internationally are constantly changing and the implementation of these laws has become more complex 

in the united states alone we may be subject to regulation at both the federal and state level in order to maintain our compliance with such laws as they come to fruition we may sustain increased costs in order to continually evaluate our policies and processes and adapt to new requirements that are or become applicable to us as the regulatory environment relating to retailers’ and other companies’ obligation to protect personal information becomes stricter a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines other regulatory sanctions or government investigation and potentially to lawsuits brought by private individuals regulators or states’ attorney general 

we could be adversely affected by the failure to adequately protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or by claims of third parties that we infringe their intellectual property rights 

our proprietary rights in our trademarks trade names service marks domain names copyrights patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business we rely on a combination of trademark law patent law copyright law trade secret protections and contractual arrangements such as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights maintenance and when necessary enforcement of our intellectual property rights require expenditure of financial and managerial resources and despite our efforts we may not always be able to effectively protect all such rights we may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own 

additionally our trade secrets are vulnerable to public disclosure by our own employees or as a result of a breach of or damage to our systems which could result in theft of our proprietary property we may also be subject to intellectual property infringement lawsuits brought by third parties against us claiming that our operations products or services infringe third party rights whether meritorious or not including patent and trademark rights which can be time consuming and costly to defend or settle and may cause significant diversion of management attention and result in substantial monetary damages injunctive orders against us unfavorable royaltybearing licensing agreements or bad publicity 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit cards debit cards credit accounts our private label and cobranded credit cards gift cards consumer invoicing and physical bank checks and we may offer different payment options over time these payment options subject us to many compliance requirements including but not limited to compliance with payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements rules governing electronic funds transfers and payment card industry data security standards they also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks gift cards and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omnichannel sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

access to the internet from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them our websites including lowescom and lowesforproscom are a sales channel for our products and are also a method of making product project and other relevant information available to our customers that impacts our instore sales additionally we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire inform crosssell establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service ransomware or other cyberattacks or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of lowe’s as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services 

if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists with expanded skill sets or corporate support staff with the capabilities of delivering on strategic objectives we could lose sales to our competitors and our labor costs resulting from operations or the execution of corporate strategies could be negatively affected 

our customers whether they are homeowners renters or commercial businesses expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide we compete with other retailers for many of our sales associates and specialists and we invest significantly in them with respect to training and development to strive for high engagement increasingly our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets including in some instances the ability to do inhome or telephone sales a challenge we face is attracting and retaining a sufficiently diverse workforce that can deliver relevant culturally competent and differentiated experiences for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers in fact in many of our stores our employees must be able to serve customers whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own additionally in order to deliver on the omnichannel expectations of our customers we rely on the specialized training and capabilities of corporate support staff which are broadly sought after by our competitors if we are unable to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our results of operations could be negatively affected furthermore our ability to meet our labor needs particularly in a competitive labor market while controlling our costs is subject to a variety of external factors including wage rates the availability of and competition for talent health care and other benefit costs our brand image and reputation changing demographics and adoption of new or revised immigration employment and labor laws and regulations periodically we are subject to labor organizing efforts and if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect how we operate our business and adversely affect our labor costs and our ability to retain a qualified workforce 

positively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is critical to our business success and if our public image and reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers vendors and store associates and specialists and consequently our business and results of operations 

our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at lowe’s our vendors want to do business with lowe’s and our sales associates and specialists want to work for lowe’s we must continue to manage preserve and grow lowe’s public image and reputation any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence reduce demand for our products and services affect our relationships with current and future vendors impact our results of operations and affect our ability to retain and recruit store associates and specialists the significant expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents 

strategic transactions such as our acquisition of rona and maintenance supply headquarters involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous uncertainties and risks 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions joint ventures investments and other growth market and geographic expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales cost savings synergies and other various benefits our ability to deliver the expected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks including our ability to integrate personnel labor models financial it and other systems successfully disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management hiring additional management and other critical personnel and increasing the scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations additionally any impairment of goodwill or other assets acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any strategic transaction may materially reduce our earnings our shareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions we may not realize any anticipated benefits from such transactions we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business or joint venture and we may be exposed to litigation in connection with the strategic transaction further we may finance these strategic transactions by incurring additional debt which could increase leverage or impact our ability to access capital in the future 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales profitability cash flows and financial condition 

product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe’s and our brand image if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement action and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities as a result lowe’s reputation as a retailer of highquality products and services including both national and lowe’s private brands could suffer and impact customer loyalty 

our business could be affected by uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions including natural disasters could impact our operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms fires floods tornadoes and earthquakes unseasonable or 

unexpected or extreme weather conditions or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and 

confidence and consumers’ disposable income particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects and 

could have an adverse effect on our financial performance these types of events can also adversely affect our work force and 

prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities they can also disrupt or disable operations of stores support centers and portions of our supply chain and distribution network including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services in addition these events may affect our information systems resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores as a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events we may experience interruption to our operations increased costs or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively or if they develop a substantially more effective or lower cost means of meeting customer needs resulting in a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the principal competitive factors in our industry include convenience customer service quality and price of merchandise and services instock levels and merchandise assortment and presentation we face growing 

competition from online and omnichannel retailers who have a similar product or service offering customers are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine realtime product availability and price using digital tools further online and omnichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services as customers are increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping and we must make investments to keep up with our customers’ evolving shopping preferences our ability to be competitive on delivery times delivery costs and delivery options depends on many factors including successful implementation of our initiatives related to supply chain transformation our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our results 

our inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national and international brand names we also have relationships with certain suppliers to enable us to sell proprietary products which differentiate us from other retailers the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business many of these vendors and service providers have certain products or specialized skills needed to support our business concept and our strategies if these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or are unable to perform as expected or if we fail to manage them properly or we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to replace them 

if our domestic or international supply chain or our fulfillment network for our products is ineffective or disrupted for any reason or if these operations are subject to trade policy changes our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we source stock and sell products from domestic and international vendors and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success we source a large number of our products from foreign manufacturers with china being the dominant import source the current united states administration has enacted and signaled the possibility of additional changes in certain tax and trade policies tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products and the exit or renegotiation of certain trade agreements and the rules of the world trade organization while it is not possible to predict the long term impacts such changes may have because we source a large percentage of our merchandise from outside the united states future changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations could adversely affect our business results of operations effective income tax rate liquidity and net income in addition other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in united states trade policy and regulations the degree of our exposure is dependent on among other things the type of goods rates imposed and timing of tariffs the impact to our business including net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential costs increases by us and our competitors while these potential impacts are uncertain they could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

financial instability among key vendors political instability and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain changes in the total costs in our supply chain fuel labor and currency exchange rates port labor disputes and security the outbreak of pandemics weatherrelated events natural disasters work stoppages shipping capacity restraints changes in trade policy retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the united states or a major source country tariffs or duties fluctuations in currency exchange rates and transport availability capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs additionally as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience delays in inventory increased delivery costs or merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to effectively manage our thirdparty installers could result in increased operational and legal risks and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we use thirdparty installers to provide installation services to our customers and as the general contractor we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors including the management of the permitting licensing and 

quality of our thirdparty installers our failure to effectively manage such requirements the thirdparty installers and our internal processes regarding installation services could result in lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could negatively affect our business 

operating internationally presents unique challenges including some that have required us to adapt our store operations merchandising marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada our business and results of operations could be negatively affected if we are unable to effectively address these challenges 

we operate stores in canada expanding and operating internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks of operation and expansion and slow the anticipated rate of expansion our future operating results in canada or in other countries or regions in which we may operate in the future could be negatively affected by a variety of factors including unfavorable political or economic factors adverse tax consequences volatility in foreign currency exchange rates increased difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights costs and difficulties of managing international operations challenges with identifying and contracting with local suppliers and other risks created as a result of differences in culture laws and regulations these factors could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

we must comply with various and multiple laws and regulations that differ substantially in each area where we operate changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities or our inability to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

laws and regulations at the local regional state federal and international levels change frequently and the changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors if we fail to comply with these laws rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied we may be subject to government enforcement action litigation damage to our reputation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties and increased cost of regulatory compliance any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance these laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to import and export requirements us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws rules and regulations there can be no certainty that our employees and third parties with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or laws many of these laws rules and regulations are complex evolving and are subject to varying interpretations and enforcement actions any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies as a result of enforcing existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry country or practice 

future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements negatively affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and in the future will become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments furthermore defending against these proceedings may require a diversion of management’s attention and resources none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved individually or collectively are considered material 

our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain improve upgrade and expand those systems 

our efforts to provide an omnichannel experience for our customers include investing in maintaining and making ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as sales inventory replenishment merchandise ordering project design and execution transportation receipt processing and fulfillment our systems are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events power outages viruses malicious attacks and telecommunications failures and as a result we may incur significant expense data loss as well as an erosion of customer confidence additionally we continually make investments in our systems which may introduce disruption our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain improve upgrade and expand those systems 

liquidity and access to capital rely on efficient rational and open capital markets and are dependent on lowe’s credit strength our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business financial performance and results of operations 

we have relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund our working capital needs our access to these markets depends on our strong credit ratings the overall condition of debt capital markets and our operating performance disruption in the financial markets or an erosion of our credit strength or declines on our credit rating could impact negatively our ability to meet capital requirements or fund working capital needs 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales 

many us and global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of slow economic growth or recession decreasing housing turnover or home price appreciation volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of borrowing to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending high rates of unemployment consumer debt levels outbreak of pandemics fluctuations in fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters and acts of both domestic and international terrorism sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects adverse development in these factors could result in a decrease in home improvement activity which could reduce demand for our products and services 

in addition although we are monitoring the effects of a widespread outbreak of a contagious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in wuhan china covid19 we cannot predict whether for how long or the extent to which the outbreak may disrupt our supply chain operations sales andor product shipments and home installations a prolonged outbreak could negatively impact our vendors and customers cause interruptions to our operations including the reduction of store operating hours temporary store closures and reduced store traffic and adversely affect our results of operations more generally a widespread health crisis could adversely affect the us economy resulting in an economic downturn that could decrease consumer confidence and affect demand for our products and therefore impact our results including our business and financial outlook for fiscal 2020 any adverse impact on our results of operations business or financial outlook could be material

executive overview 

net sales for fiscal 2019 increased 12 over fiscal year 2018 to 721 billion  the increase in total sales was driven by an increase in comparable sales offset by a decrease in sales due to closed stores and the exit of the mexico and orchard supply hardware orchard businesses comparable sales increased 26 over fiscal year 2018  driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 21 and an increase in comparable transactions of 05 net earnings for fiscal 2019 increased 850 to 43 billion  diluted earnings per common share increased 931 in fiscal year 2019 to 549 from 284 in 2018  as further discussed below during fiscal year 2019 we completed a strategic review of the canadian operations and finalized the closure of the mexico business resulting in net pretax operating costs and charges of 265 million which decreased diluted earnings per share by 025 adjusting 2019 and 2018 amounts for certain significant discrete items not contemplated in the business outlooks for those respective years adjusted diluted earnings per common share increased 123 in fiscal year 2019 to 574 from 511 in 2018 see the nongaap financial measures discussion 

for 2019  cash flows from operating activities were approximately 43 billion  with 15 billion used for capital expenditures continuing to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders the company repurchased 410 million shares of stock through the share repurchase program for 43 billion and paid 16 billion in dividends during the year 

during the prior year we announced our intention to exit our mexico retail operations and our plan to sell the operating business however during the first quarter of 2019 after an extensive market evaluation the decision was made to instead sell the assets of the business this resulted in an 82 million tax benefit in the first quarter this benefit was partially offset by 35 million of pretax operating costs during the year associated with the exit and ongoing winddown of the business 

in the third quarter of 2019 we commenced a strategic review of the canadian operations to improve execution and deliver longterm improved profitability in canada as a result during the fourth quarter we completed the closure of 28 underperforming stores with the remaining six planned closures to be completed in early fiscal 2020 in addition canadian operations started a sku rationalization project to present a more coordinated assortment of product to the customer across banners and began the reorganization of the corporate structure to more efficiently serve stores total pretax operating costs and charges associated with the strategic review of the canadian operations were 230 million for fiscal year 2019 

during the year we made significant progress transforming our company through our four key focus areas driving merchandising excellence transforming our supply chain delivering operational efficiency and intensifying customer engagement our merchandise service teams mst have improved our merchandising reset execution and daytoday bay and endcap maintenance at the store level to deliver a better shopping experience to our customers we made improvements to our store environment optimizing our layout on the critically important seasonal pad at the front of our stores we also opened two new bulk distribution centers relocated a third bulk distribution center and opened four new crossdock delivery terminals in 2019 we focused on improving our customer service and investing in our instock position driving efficiency in our store operations and advancing our pro service model we rolled out a customer centric scheduling system that allows us to provide better department coverage and customer service while ensuring that we are using our payroll efficiently we have also added scheduling effectiveness tools that measure schedule efficiency and deployed new mobile devices to our store associates with 

applications to help make our associates more efficient and ultimately allowed them to spend more time interacting with customers in 2019 our pro strategy was primarily focused on improving retail fundamentals such as job lot quantities improved service levels dedicated loaders pro department supervisors and consistent volume pricing in addition during the fourth quarter we added dedicated point of sale terminals at our pro desk to allow for more convenient faster service 

in 2019 we made significant progress in transforming our company although we are only one year into a multiyear transformation we believe that we are on the right path to capitalize on demand in the home improvement market and our planned improvements to the lowescom platform will allow these four strategic areas of focus to create a true omnichannel ecosystem for lowe’s so we can efficiently serve our customers any way they choose to shop 

operations 

the following tables set forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings as well as the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements 





 

nongaap financial measures 

return on invested capital 

return on invested capital roic is calculated using a nongaap financial measure we believe roic is a meaningful metric for investors because it represents management’s measure of how effectively the company is using capital to generate profits although roic is a common financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating roic accordingly the method used by our management may differ from the methods used by other companies we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roic before comparing to ours 

we define roic as rolling 12 months’ lease adjusted net operating profit after tax lease adjusted nopat divided by the average of current year and prior year ending debt and equity lease adjusted nopat is a nongaap financial measure and net earnings is considered to be the most comparable gaap financial measure the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation of net earnings to lease adjusted nopat is as follows 



 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

adjusted diluted earnings per share is considered a nongaap financial measure the company believes this nongaap financial measure provides useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating what management considers the company’s core financial performance adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of certain discrete items not contemplated in the company’s business outlooks for 2019 and 2018 unless otherwise noted the income tax effect of these adjustments is calculated using the marginal rates for the respective periods 

adjusted diluted earnings per share should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful indicator of the company’s diluted earnings per common share as prepared in accordance with gaap the company’s methods of determining this nongaap financial measure may differ from the method used by other companies for this or similar nongaap financial measures accordingly these nongaap measures may not be comparable to the measures used by other companies

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 

net sales – net sales increased 12 to 721 billion in 2019  the increase in total sales was driven primarily by 26 comparable sales growth and new stores 02 offset by the impact from closed stores and exit of the mexico  orchard operations 16 the comparable sales increase of 26 in 2019 was driven primarily by a 21 increase in comparable average ticket and a 05 increase in comparable customer transactions comparable sales increases during each quarter of the fiscal year as reported were 35 in the first quarter 23 in the second quarter 22 in the third quarter and 25 in the fourth quarter 

during 2019  we experienced comparable sales increases in ten of 13 product categories we experienced mid singledigit negative comparable sales in lighting and kitchens  bath primarily due to the exit of the project specialist interiors psi business in 2018 lighting also experienced decreased volume of sales due to price increases to offset tariff pressure comparable sales increases were above the company average in lawn  garden décor tools paint appliances millwork seasonal  outdoor living hardware rough plumbing  electrical and lumber  building materials favorable weather driven demand was a key comparable sales driver for lawn  garden seasonal  outdoor living hardware and paint décor comparable sales were driven by strong performance in blinds  shades promotional activity and improved inventory position strong refrigerator and laundry performance during major holiday promotion events in appliances drove strong comparable sales during the year tools benefited from the craftsman ® reset in the prior year as well as strong performance during promotional events during the year geographically all 15 us regions experienced positive comparable sales with the strongest results in the west and south 

during the fourth quarter of 2019  we experienced comparable sales increases in nine of 13 product categories comparable sales increases were above the company average in décor lawn  garden paint millwork lumber  building materials tools hardware and appliances strength in décor was driven primarily by the winter reorganization promotional event particularly inhome organization products unseasonably warm weather drove strong comparable sales in lawn  garden paint and lumber  building materials we experienced low singledigit negative comparable sales in seasonal  outdoor living kitchens  bath and lighting due primarily to the exit of the psi business in the prior year seasonal  outdoor living experienced softness in seasonal and outdoor heat due to warmer than expected weather geographically 14 of 15 us regions experienced increases in fourth quarter comparable sales 

gross margin – gross margin as a percentage of sales for 2019 decreased 32 basis points compared to 2018  gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 35 basis points due to tariff pressure 20 basis points from supply chain costs associated with new facilities transportation and customer deliveries and 10 basis points associated with increased inventory shrink this was partially offset by a gross margin increase of approximately 40 basis points due to our prior year inventory rationalization efforts to eliminate less productive skus and reduce clutter in our stores 

during the fourth quarter of 2019  gross margin decreased 22 basis points as a percentage of sales gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points from the impact of store closures and inventory liquidation associated with the canadian restructuring 25 basis points from supply chain costs associated with new facilities transportation and 

customer deliveries and 25 basis points associated with increased inventory shrink this was partially offset by 105 basis points due to the use of rate mitigation strategies 

sga – sga expense for 2019 leveraged 311 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2018  this was primarily driven by 265 basis points of leverage due to prior year goodwill and longlived asset impairments and discontinued projects associated with the company’s prior year strategic reassessment of orchard ushi canada and mexico locations there was an additional 45 basis points of leverage in salaries expenses and 15 basis points of leverage in advertising due to improved advertising efficiency these were partially offset by 10 basis points of deleverage associated with current year longlived asset impairment severance and other costs associated with the company’s strategic review of the canadian operations 

for the fourth quarter of 2019  sga expense leveraged 959 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  this was primarily driven by 960 basis points of leverage due to prior year goodwill and longlived asset impairments and discontinued projects associated with the company’s prior year strategic reassessment of orchard ushi canada and mexico locations as well as 20 basis points of leverage in salaries expenses these were partially offset by 20 basis points of deleverage associated with the current year longlived asset impairment severance and other costs associated with the company’s strategic review of the canadian operations 

depreciation and amortization – depreciation and amortization expense leveraged 32 basis points for 2019 as a percentage of sales compared to 2018  primarily due to store closures in the prior year and assets becoming fully depreciated property less accumulated depreciation increased to 187 billion at january 31 2020  compared to 184 billion at february 1 2019  as of january 31 2020 and february 1 2019  we owned 84 and 83 of our stores respectively which included stores on leased land 

interest – net – net interest expense is comprised of the following 



net interest expense in 2019 deleveraged 8 basis points primarily as a result of interest expense related to the issuance of 30 billion unsecured notes in april 2019 and a 10 billion term loan issued in january 2020 partially offset by a decrease in expense associated with the adoption of asu 201602 leases topic 842  in the first quarter of 2019 

income tax provision  our effective income tax rate was 239 in 2019 compared to 318 in 2018  for 2019 the rate was favorably impacted by the tax benefit associated with the company’s decision to sell the assets of the mexico business which was offset by a valuation allowance established for the company’s rona operations for 2018 the favorable impact of tax reform was offset by the majority of the canadian goodwill impairment not being deductible for tax purposes as well as negative tax impacts associated with the initial decision to exit mexico 

our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was negatively impacted by the valuation allowances established for the company’s rona operations the fourth quarter of 2018 was negatively impacted by the nondeductibility of a majority of the goodwill impairment charge related to our canadian business as well as the negative tax consequences of exiting our retail operations in mexico 

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 

for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended february 1 2019 and february 2 2018 see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 1 2019 filed with the sec on april 2 2019 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity 

cash flows from operations supplemented with our shortterm and longterm borrowings have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments that will grow our business and to return excess cash to 

shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases we believe that our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our operations and investments to grow our business repay our debt as it becomes due pay dividends and fund our share repurchases over the next 12 months 

cash flows provided by operating activities 



cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended january 31 2020  versus the year ended february 1 2019  was due primarily to changes in working capital driven by accounts payable and inventory which decreased operating cash flow for fiscal 2019 by approximately 12 billion compared to an increase of approximately 430 million for fiscal 2018 in fiscal year 2019 inventory increased at the same time that accounts payable decreased the increase in inventory was driven by strategic investments in the first half of fiscal 2019 including earlier seasonal purchases resets and increased job lot quantities to increase sales the decrease in accounts payable is due to timing of payments partially related to the inventory build in late fiscal 2018 in fiscal 2018 the increase in accounts payable exceeded the increase in inventory driven by inventory rationalization efforts during the second half of fiscal 2018 and an acceleration of spring purchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended february 1 2019  versus the year ended february 2 2018  was due primarily to changes in working capital driven by accounts payable and inventory which increased operating cash flow for 2018 by approximately 430 million compared to a decrease of approximately 883 million for 2017 in fiscal 2018 the increase in accounts payable exceeded the increase in inventory driven by inventory rationalization efforts during the second half of fiscal 2018 and an acceleration of spring purchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018

in 2019 we issued 30 billion of unsecured notes to finance 2019 maturities and for other general corporate purposes which included share repurchases capital expenditures strategic investments and working capital needs in 2019 we paid approximately 11 billion to retire scheduled debts at maturity 

in 2018 we paid approximately 250 million to retire scheduled debts at maturity

see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our longterm debt 

share repurchases 

we have an ongoing share repurchase program authorized by the company’s board of directors that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private offmarket transactions we also withhold shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding liabilities shares repurchased are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status the following table provides on a settlement date basis the total number of shares repurchased average price paid per share and the total amount paid for share repurchases for 2019  2018  and 2017

capital resources 

we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both shortterm and longterm bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new longterm debt the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected however by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard  poor’s sp and moody’s as of march 23 2020  which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds our debt ratings have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 



there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price in addition we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate significant cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at january 31 2020  



 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory 

description 

we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels sales trends and historical experience during 2019  our reserve increased approximately 27 million to 105 million as of january 31 2020  

we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories during 2019  the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately 22 million to 244 million as of january 31 2020  

in addition we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business principally as a result of purchase volumes sales early payments or promotions of vendors’ products generally these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor’s product many of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter the funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned as the related inventory is sold the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors’ products are recorded as an offset to the related expense 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions however changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves likewise changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and results of physical inventories we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value 

for vendor funds we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves however it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves a 10 change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 5 million for 2019  a 10 change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 18 million for 2019  

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective longterm estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 

longlived asset impairment 

description 

we review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable when evaluating locations for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead 

we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to longlived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location’s asset may not be recoverable for operating locations our primary indicator that assets may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a 12month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment including individual locations’ execution of their operating plans and local market conditions including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe’s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location’s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets the carrying value of a location’s asset group includes inventory property operating and finance lease rightofuse assets and operating liabilities including inventory payables salaries payable and operating lease liabilities financial and nonoperating liabilities are excluded from the carrying value of the asset group when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location management makes assumptions incorporating local market conditions about key store variables including sales growth rates gross margin and controllable expenses such as store payroll and operating expense as well as asset residual values or lease rates operating lease payments are included in the projected future cash flows financing lease payments are excluded from the projected future cash flows an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 

we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations which requires discounting projected future cash flows this involves making assumptions regarding both a location’s future cash flows as described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours 

we use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for closure this involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated the information includes comparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these assets 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows including estimated sales margin and controllable expenses assumptions about market performance for operating locations and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 the company recorded impairment charges totaling 62 million and 331 million respectively within selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values our actual impairment losses could vary from our estimated impairment losses in the event that our estimates vary from actual results we may record additional impairment losses which could be material to our results of operations 

selfinsurance 

description 

we are selfinsured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation automobile general and product liability extended protection plan and certain medical and dental claims we have excess insurance coverage above certain retention amounts to limit exposure from single events and earnings volatility our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable is limited to 2 million per occurrence involving workers’ compensation 10 million per occurrence involving general or product liability and 10 million per occurrence involving automobile we do not have any excess insurance coverage for selfinsured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims selfinsurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for selfinsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during 2019  our selfinsurance liability increased approximately 151 million to 11 billion as of january 31 2020  

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposures including payroll sales and vehicle units as well as the frequency lag and severity of claims 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded selfinsurance liabilities a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 83 million for 2019  a 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately 22 million for 2019  




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

we use forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes in future debt issuances the fair value of our derivative financial instruments as of january 31 2020 was not material fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and consists primarily of fixedrate instruments therefore providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instruments 

commodity price risk 

we purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control we believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices the selling prices of these commodity products are influenced in part by the market price we pay which is determined by industry supply and demand we do not believe that changing prices for commodities due to inflation or deflation have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition and result of operations

 item 1a  risk factors 

we have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys external research planning processes risk mapping analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational financial environmental reputational strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business for more information about our risk management framework which is administered by our chief financial officer and includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify see the description included in the definitive proxy statement for our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders as defined in item 10 of part iii of this annual report under “information about the board of directors and committees of the board  board meetings committees of the board and board leadership structure  board’s role in the risk management process” 

we describe below certain risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition business reputation or business prospects these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended supplemented or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in our future periodic reports on form 10k form 10q and reports on other forms we file with the securities and exchange commission all forwardlooking statements about our future results of operations or other matters made by us in this annual report in our annual report to lowe’s shareholders and in our subsequently filed reports to the securities and exchange commission as well as in our press releases and other public communications are qualified by the risks described below 

you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this annual report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

we may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address the changing shopping habits demands and demographics of our customers or realize the intended benefits of organizational change initiatives 

the home improvement retail environment like the retail environment generally is rapidly evolving and adapting our business concept to respond to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and their changing demographics is critical to our future success our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to the economic social style and other trends that affect demographic and consumer preferences in a variety of our merchandise categories and service offerings customers’ expectations about how they wish to research purchase and receive products and services have also evolved it is difficult to predict the mix of products and services that our customers will demand failure to identify such trends adapt our business concept and implement change growth and productivity initiatives successfully could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for the home improvement products and services we sell the rate of growth of our business our market share and results of operations 

we may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on omnichannel sales and marketing presence if we fail to deliver the capabilities required to execute on them 

our interactions with customers has evolved into an omnichannel experience as they increasingly are using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all 

aspects of our business omnichannel retail is quickly evolving and we must anticipate and meet our customers’ expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors our customerfacing technology systems must appeal to our customers function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience the success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and changing demographics will require us to deliver large complex programs requiring more integrated planning initiative prioritization and program sequencing these initiatives will require new competencies in many positions and our management employees and contractors will have to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access our results of operations financial condition or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we fail to provide a consistent experience for our customers regardless of sales channel if our technology systems do not meet our customers’ expectations if we are unable to counteract new developments and innovations implemented by our competitors or if we are unable to attract retain and manage the talent succession of additional personnel at various levels of the company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic initiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly changing retail environment 

our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer employee vendor or company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems assets and such information 

cyberattacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving and high profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major us companies including several large retailers despite widespread recognition of the cyberattack threat and improved data protection methods as with many other retailers we receive and store certain personal information about our customers employees and vendors additionally we use thirdparty service providers for certain services such as authentication content delivery backoffice support and other functions and we provide such thirdparty service providers with personal information necessary for the services concerned despite our continued vigilance and investment in information security we like others in our industry are subject to the risk that unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates third party providers or vendors and we or our thirdparty service providers cannot guarantee that we or they are able to adequately anticipate or prevent a future breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized access to destruction misuse or release of personal information or other sensitive data it can be difficult to preempt or detect everevolving forms of cyberattacks if a ransomware attack occurs it is possible that we could be prevented from accessing our own data our information security or our service providers’ information security may also be compromised because of human errors including by employees or system errors our systems and our service providers’ systems are additionally vulnerable to a number of other causes such as power outages computer viruses technology system failures or catastrophic events in the event that our systems are breached or damaged for any reason we may also suffer loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to our business operations while such breach or damage is being remedied should these events occur the unauthorized disclosure loss or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation drive existing and potential customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions or potential liability including possible litigation and punitive damages a security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of data from our information systems or our thirdparty service providers’ information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks and require dedication of substantial resources to manage the aftermath of such a breach data privacy and cybersecurity laws in the united states and internationally are constantly changing and in the united states alone we may be subject to regulation at both the federal and state level in order to maintain our compliance with such laws as they come to fruition we may sustain increased costs in order to continually evaluate our policies and processes and adapt to new requirements that are or become applicable to us as the regulatory environment relating to retailers’ and other companies’ obligation to protect personal information becomes stricter a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines other regulatory sanctions or government investigation and potentially to lawsuits brought by private individuals regulators or states’ attorney general 

we could be adversely affected by the failure to adequately protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or claims by third parties that we infringe their intellectual property rights 

our proprietary rights in our trademarks trade names service marks domain names copyrights patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business we rely on a combination of trademark law patent law copyright law trade secret protections and contractual arrangements such as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights maintenance and when necessary enforcement of our intellectual property rights require expenditure of financial and managerial resources and despite our efforts we may not always be able to effectively protect all of such rights we may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own additionally our trade secrets are vulnerable to public disclosure by our own employees or as a result of a breach of 

or damage to our systems which could result in theft of our proprietary property we may also be subject to intellectual property infringement lawsuits brought by third parties against us claiming that our operations products or services infringe third party rights whether meritorious or not including patent and trademark rights which can be time consuming and costly to defend or settle and may cause significant diversion of management attention and result in substantial monetary damages injunctive orders against us unfavorable royaltybearing licensing agreements or bad publicity 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit cards debit cards credit accounts our private label and cobranded credit cards gift cards consumer invoicing and physical bank checks and we may offer different payment options over time these payment options subject us to many compliance requirements including but not limited to compliance with payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements rules governing electronic funds transfers and payment card industry data security standards they also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks gift cards and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omnichannel sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

access to the internet from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them our websites including lowescom and lowesforproscom are a sales channel for our products and are also a method of making product project and other relevant information available to our customers that impacts our instore sales additionally we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire inform crosssell establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service ransomware or other cyberattacks or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of lowe’s as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services 

if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists with expanded skill sets or corporate support staff with the capabilities of delivering on strategic objectives we could lose sales to our competitors and our labor costs resulting from operations or the execution of corporate strategies could be negatively affected 

our customers whether they are homeowners renters or commercial businesses expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide we compete with other retailers for many of our sales associates and specialists and we invest significantly in them with respect to training and development to strive for high engagement increasingly our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets including in some instances the ability to do inhome or telephone sales a challenge we face is attracting and retaining a sufficiently diverse workforce that can deliver relevant culturally competent and differentiated experiences for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers in fact in many of our stores our employees must be able to serve customers whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own additionally in order to deliver on the omnichannel expectations of our customers we rely on the specialized training and capabilities of corporate support staff which are broadly sought after by our competitors if we are unable to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our results of operations could be negatively affected furthermore our ability to meet our labor needs particularly in a competitive labor market while controlling our costs is subject to a variety of external factors including wage rates the availability of and competition for talent health care and other benefit costs our brand image and reputation changing demographics and adoption of new or revised immigration employment and labor laws and regulations periodically we are subject to labor organizing efforts and if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect how we operate our business and adversely affect our labor costs and our ability to retain a qualified workforce 

if we do not successfully manage the transitions associated with the appointment of a new chairman chief executive officer and chief financial officer and other members of our leadership team as part of a new leadership structure it could have an adverse impact on our business operations as well as be viewed negatively by our customers and shareholders 

on may 20 2018 the board of directors of the company appointed marvin r ellison as president and chief executive officer and richard r dreiling as chairman of the board of directors in each case effective as of july 2 2018 on july 2 2018 mr ellison assumed the office of president and chief executive officer and joined the board of directors and mr dreiling became chairman of the board of directors mr ellison and mr dreiling succeeded robert a niblock who retired as chairman president and chief executive officer of the company and member of the board of directors effective july 2 2018 on june 4 2018 we announced that marshall a croom planned to retire from the company effective october 5 2018 and on august 22 2018 we named david m denton as executive vice president chief financial officer which appointment became effective on november 19 2018 in addition on july 9 2018 we announced the implementation of a new leadership structure and named william p boltz as executive vice president merchandising effective august 15 2018 on july 20 2018 we named joseph m mcfarland iii as executive vice president stores effective august 15 2018 on august 7 2018 we named donald e frieson as executive vice president supply chain effective august 8 2018 on november 2 2018 the company announced the appointment of seemantini godbole as chief information officer effective november 12 2018 such leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and an inadequate transition may cause disruption to our business including to our relationships with our customers suppliers vendors and employees it may also make it more difficult to hire and retain key employees 

positively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is critical to our business success and if our public image and reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers vendors and store associates and specialists and consequently our business and results of operations 

our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at lowe’s our vendors want to do business with lowe’s and our sales associates and specialists want to work for lowe’s we must continue to manage preserve and grow lowe’s public image and reputation any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence reduce demand for our products and services affect our relationships with current and future vendors impact our results of operations and affect our ability to retain and recruit store associates and specialists the significant expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents 

strategic transactions such as our acquisition of rona and maintenance supply headquarters involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous uncertainties and risks 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions joint ventures investments and other growth market and geographic expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales cost savings synergies and other various benefits our ability to deliver the expected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks including our ability to integrate personnel labor models financial it and other systems successfully disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management hiring additional management and other critical personnel and increasing the scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations additionally any impairment of goodwill or other assets acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any strategic transaction may materially reduce our earnings for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we recognized a 952 million goodwill impairment charge on our canadian business our shareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions we may not realize any anticipated benefits from such transactions we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business or joint venture and we may be exposed to litigation in connection with the strategic transaction further we may finance these strategic transactions by incurring additional debt which could increase leverage or impact our ability to access capital in the future 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales profitability cash flows and financial condition 

product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe’s and our brand image if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement action and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities as a result lowe’s reputation as a retailer of high quality products and services including both national and lowe’s private brands could suffer and impact customer loyalty 

we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively or if they develop a substantially more effective or lower cost means of meeting customer needs resulting in a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the principal competitive factors in our industry include convenience customer service quality and price of merchandise and services instock levels and merchandise assortment and presentation we face growing competition from online and omnichannel retailers who have a similar product or service offering customers are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine realtime product availability and price using digital tools further online and omnichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services as customers are increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping and we must make investments to keep up with our customers’ evolving shopping preferences our ability to be competitive on delivery times delivery costs and delivery options depends on many factors including successful implementation of our initiatives related to supply chain transformation our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our results 

our inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national and international brand names we also have relationships with certain suppliers to enable us to sell proprietary products which differentiate us from other retailers the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business many of these vendors and service providers have certain products or specialized skills needed to support our business concept and our strategies if these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or are unable to perform as expected or if we fail to manage them properly or we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to replace them 

if our domestic or international supply chain or our fulfillment network for our products is ineffective or disrupted for any reason or if these operations are subject to trade policy changes our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we source stock and sell products from domestic and international vendors and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success we source a large number of our products from foreign manufacturers with china being the dominant import source the current united states administration has signaled the possibility of major changes in certain tax and trade policies tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products and the exit or renegotiation of certain trade agreements including the north american free trade act nafta and the rules of the world trade organization political developments in the united states including possible termination of nafta or failure to finalize and implement the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca the proposed replacement for nafta may have implications for the trade arrangements among the united states mexico and canada while it is not possible to predict whether or when any such changes will occur or what form they may take because we source a large percentage of our merchandise from outside the united states major changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations could adversely affect our business results of operations effective income tax rate liquidity and net income in addition other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in united states trade policy and regulations 

financial instability among key vendors political instability and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain changes in the total costs in our supply chain fuel labor and currency exchange rates port labor disputes and security the outbreak of pandemics weatherrelated events natural disasters work stoppages shipping capacity restraints changes in trade policy retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the united states or a major source country tariffs or duties fluctuations in currency exchange rates and transport availability capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs additionally as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience delays in inventory increased 

delivery costs or merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to effectively manage our thirdparty installers could result in increased operational and legal risks and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we use thirdparty installers to provide installation services to our customers and as the general contractor we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors including the management of the permitting licensing and quality of our thirdparty installers our failure to effectively manage such requirements the thirdparty installers and our internal processes regarding installation services could result in lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could negatively affect our business 

operating internationally presents unique challenges including some that have required us to adapt our store operations merchandising marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada and mexico our business and results of operations could be negatively affected if we are unable to effectively address these challenges 

we operate stores in canada and mexico we have previously announced our intent to exit our mexican operations and we are currently exploring exit alternatives expanding and operating internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks of operation and expansion and slow the anticipated rate of expansion our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions in which we currently operate or may operate in the future could be negatively affected by a variety of factors including unfavorable political or economic factors adverse tax consequences volatility in foreign currency exchange rates increased difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights costs and difficulties of managing international operations challenges with identifying and contracting with local suppliers and other risks created as a result of differences in culture laws and regulations these factors could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

we must comply with various and multiple laws and regulations that differ substantially in each area where we operate changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities or our inability to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

laws and regulations at the local regional state federal and international levels change frequently and the changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors if we fail to comply with these laws rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied we may be subject to government enforcement action litigation damage to our reputation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties and increased cost of regulatory compliance any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance these laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to import and export requirements us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws rules and regulations there can be no certainty that our employees and third parties with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or laws many of these laws rules and regulations are complex evolving and are subject to varying interpretations and enforcement actions any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies as a result of enforcing existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry country or practice 

future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements negatively affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and in the future will become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments furthermore defending against these proceedings may require a diversion of management’s attention and resources none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved individually or collectively are considered material 

our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain improve upgrade and expand those systems 

our efforts to provide an omnichannel experience for our customers include investing in maintaining and making ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as sales inventory replenishment 

merchandise ordering project design and execution transportation receipt processing and fulfillment our systems are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events power outages viruses malicious attacks and telecommunications failures and as a result we may incur significant expense data loss as well as an erosion of customer confidence additionally we continually make investments in our systems which may introduce disruption our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain improve upgrade and expand those systems 

liquidity and access to capital rely on efficient rational and open capital markets and are dependent on lowe’s credit strength our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business financial performance and results of operations 

we have relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund our working capital needs our access to these markets depends on our strong credit ratings the overall condition of debt capital markets and our operating performance disruption in the financial markets or an erosion of our credit strength or declines on our credit rating could impact negatively our ability to meet capital requirements or fund working capital needs 

discontinuation reform or replacement of libor and other benchmark rates or uncertainty related to the potential for any of the foregoing may adversely affect our business 

the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 in addition other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates the discontinuation reform or replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation reform or replacement may negatively impact interest expense related to borrowings under our credit facilities we may in the future pursue amendments to our credit facilities to provide for a transition mechanism or other reference rate in anticipation of libor’s discontinuation but we may not be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendments further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur as a result additional financing to replace our liborbased debt may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales 

many us and global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of slow economic growth or recession decreasing housing turnover or home price appreciation volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of borrowing to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending high rates of unemployment consumer debt levels fluctuations in fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters and acts of both domestic and international terrorism sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects adverse development in these factors could result in a decrease in home improvement activity which could reduce demand for our products and services

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results financial condition liquidity and capital resources during the threeyear period ended february 1 2019  our fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  fiscal year 2016 contains 53 weeks of operating results compared to fiscal years 2018 and 2017 which contain 52 weeks unless otherwise noted all references herein for the years 2018  2017  and 2016  represent the fiscal years ended february 1 2019  february 2 2018  and february 3 2017  respectively we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america this discussion and analysis is presented in six sections 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  we changed our method of accounting related to the classification of customer delivery and shipping costs under our new accounting principle shipping and handling costs related to the delivery of products from the company to customers are included in costs of sales whereas previously they were included in selling general and administrative expense as well as depreciation and amortization amounts presented for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 reflect adjusted amounts in accordance with this accounting principle change see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on the accounting principle change 

executive overview 

net sales for fiscal 2018  increased 39  over fiscal year 2017 to 713 billion  the increase in total sales was driven by an increase in comparable sales the adoption of the revenue recognition accounting standard update asu 201409 and new stores comparable sales increased 24  over fiscal year 2017  driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 34 offset by a decrease in comparable transactions of 11 net earnings for fiscal 2018 decreased 329  to 23 billion  diluted earnings per common share decreased 305  in fiscal year 2018  to 284  from 409  in 2017  as further discussed below during fiscal year 2018 we completed a strategic reassessment of the business resulting in total pretax charges of 11 billion and we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 952 million the year to date pretax charges totaling 21 billion decreased diluted earnings per share by 227 adjusting 2018  and 2017  amounts for certain significant discrete items not originally contemplated in the business outlooks for those respective years adjusted diluted earnings per common share increased 164  in fiscal year 2018  to 511  from 439  in 2017  see discussion on nongaap financial measures beginning on page 25 

for 2018  cash flows from operating activities were approximately 62 billion  with 12 billion  used for capital expenditures continuing to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders the company repurchased 312 million  shares of stock through the share repurchase program for 30 billion  and paid 15 billion  in dividends during the year 

during the last six months of fiscal 2018 we have had a comprehensive reassessment of the business established a new leadership team and worked with that team to develop action plans to improve performance improve instocks and drive a better customer experience we have sharpened our focus on retail fundamentals aligned our leadership team to improve our decisionmaking and execution and aligned our portfolio to concentrate on our core home improvement business we have rationalized our store inventory to remove clutter and reduce lowerperforming inventory and we are now investing in topselling items in job lot quantities for our pro customer 

the 2018 strategic reassessment of the business was part of our focus to build a sustainable foundation to position the company for longterm success during the third quarter of 2018 we committed to exit our orchard supply hardware orchard operations as well as close 20 underperforming stores across the us and 31 locations in canada including 27 stores and 4 other canadian locations in addition we also made the decision to pursue an exit of certain noncore activities within our us home improvement business specifically alacrity renovation services and iris smart home in the fourth quarter of 2018 we announced plans to pursue an exit of our mexico retail operations consisting of 13 stores and are currently 

exploring exit alternatives in addition during the fourth quarter of 2018 we made the decision to eliminate our project specialists interiors psi position total pretax charges associated with these decisions were 11 billion for fiscal year 2018 

in addition our fourth quarter annual goodwill impairment review resulted in a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 952 million related to our canadian operations canadian goodwill impairment given the softening outlook for the canadian housing market we determined that the book value of this business exceeded its fair market value this writedown eliminated all goodwill associated with our canadian business 

as we transition into 2019 we will remain focused on our mission of delivering the right home improvement products with the best service and value across every channel and community we serve we intend to achieve this mission by winning in four key areas including driving merchandising excellence transforming our supply chain delivering operational efficiency and intensifying customer engagement 

first delivering merchandising excellence means having the right products in the right place at the right time so our customers can shop any way they choose to do this we are working to improve productivity drive localization and streamline our reset process to improve execution as well as improve digital experiences second we intend to transform our supply chain to enhance the overall customer experience by advancing our fulfillment and delivery capabilities and delivering operational excellence we want to serve customers the way they want to be served third to deliver operational efficiency we intend to focus on simplifying store operations and work to improve our instock execution to better capitalize on the traffic we are driving to both our stores and online and as a company we intend to become more operationally efficient finally customer engagement is the fourth focus area and includes winning the pro customer we have significant opportunity to grow this portion of our business by focusing on competitive pricing instocks carrying the brands that are important to pro customers consistent service levels and providing a differentiated experience

return on invested capital roic is calculated using a nongaap financial measure we believe roic is a meaningful metric for investors because it represents management’s measure of how effectively the company is using capital to generate profits although roic is a common financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating roic accordingly the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roic we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roic before comparing its roic to ours 

we define roic as trailing four quarters’ net operating profit after tax nopat divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters nopat is a nongaap financial measure and net earnings is considered to be the most comparable gaap financial measure to nopat the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation of nopat to net earnings the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows 



 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

adjusted diluted earnings per share is considered a nongaap financial measure the company believes this nongaap financial measure provides useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating what management considers the company’s core financial performance adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of certain discrete items not contemplated in the company’s business outlooks for 2018 2017 and 2016 unless otherwise noted the income tax effect of these adjustments is calculated using the marginal rates for the respective periods 

adjusted diluted earnings per share should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful indicator of the company’s diluted earnings per common share as prepared in accordance with gaap the company’s methods of determining this nongaap financial measure may differ from the method used by other companies for this or similar nongaap financial measures accordingly these nongaap measures may not be comparable to the measures used by other companies

the effective passage date of the tax act resulted in the usage of a blended rate for fiscal 2017 of 337 the rate was also impacted by the onetime repatriation tax the new rate of 21 was applied against the company’s deferred tax balances in fiscal 2017 which resulted in a decrease of its overall deferred tax assets for that year

depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was flat compared to the prior year 

interest – net  – net interest expense is comprised of the following 



net interest expense decreased in 2017  primarily as a result of the cash tender offer to purchase and retire 16 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes the payoff of scheduled debts at maturity and the favorable settlement of accrued interest related to uncertain tax issues these were partially offset by the issuance of unsecured notes in april 2016 and may 2017 respectively 

loss on extinguishment of debt  during the first quarter of 2017 we repurchased and retired 16 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debt resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 464 million 

income tax provision   our effective income tax rate was 372  in 2017  compared to 405  in 2016  during 2017 the company was impacted by the passage of the tax act which provided a reduction in the statutory federal rate from 35 to 21 the effective date of january 1 2018 resulted in the usage of a blended rate for the year of 337 for the company the new rate of 21 was applied against the company’s deferred balances resulting in a decrease of its overall deferred tax assets the rate was also impacted by the onetime repatriation tax enacted under internal revenue code section 965 in 2016 final and temporary regulations were issued under internal revenue code section 987 which negatively impacted the company’s income tax rate due to the adjustment of deferred tax assets associated with cumulative currency translation adjustments related to certain of the company’s international operations in addition the company recorded a deferred tax asset related to the investment in the australian joint venture with woolworths associated with the noncash impairment charge that occurred during 2016 the deferred tax asset associated with this loss was offset with the establishment of a full valuation allowance due to the fact the benefit of this loss can only be realized to the extent the company has available capital gains for offset and no present or future capital gains have been identified through which this deferred tax asset can be realized 

our effective income tax rates were 413 and 403 for the three months ended february 2 2018  and february 3 2017  respectively the increase in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the enactment of the tax act effective january 1 2018 the federal rate was lowered from 35 to 21 as part of the tax act which resulted in a tax benefit of 58 million for the year the company remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new federal rate which led to a onetime tax expense of approximately 56 million to reduce the company’s overall federal deferred tax asset in addition the company recorded a 22 million provisional tax expense for the onetime transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources

cash flows provided by operating activities 



cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2018  when compared to 2017  was driven primarily by changes in working capital 

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2017  when compared to 2016  was driven primarily by changes in working capital and was partially offset by an increase in net earnings adjusted for noncash expenses

see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our longterm debt 

share repurchases 

we have an ongoing share repurchase program authorized by the company’s board of directors that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private offmarket transactions we also withhold shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding liabilities shares repurchased are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status the following table provides on a settlement date basis the total number of shares repurchased average price paid per share and the total amount paid for share repurchases for 2018  2017  and 2016

capital resources 

we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both shortterm and longterm bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new longterm debt the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected however by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard  poor’s sp and moody’s as of april 1 2019  which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds our debt ratings have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating the lowering of our credit ratings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 did not have a material impact on our access to liquidity or to our interest costs 



1 on december 12 2018 sp lowered the issuer credit ratings of the company’s senior debt from a to bbb with a stable outlook 

2 on december 12 2018 moody’s lowered the issuer credit ratings of the company’s senior debt from a3 to baa1 with a stable outlook 

there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price in addition we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate significant cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at february 1 2019  





critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements included herein we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory 

description 

we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels sales trends and historical experience during 2018  our reserve increased  approximately 1 million  to 78 million  as of february 1 2019  

we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories during 2018  the inventory shrinkage reserve increased  approximately 10 million  to 222 million  as of february 1 2019  

in addition we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business principally as a result of purchase volumes sales early payments or promotions of vendors’ products generally these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor’s product therefore we treat these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors’ products are recorded as an offset to the related expense 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions however changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves likewise changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and results of physical inventories we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value 

for vendor funds we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves however it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves a 10 change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 5 million for 2018  a 10 change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 17 million for 2018  

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective longterm estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 

longlived asset impairment 

description 

we review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable when evaluating locations for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead 

we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to longlived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location’s asset may not be recoverable for operating locations our primary indicator that assets may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a 12month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment including individual locations’ execution of their operating plans and local market conditions including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe’s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location’s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location management makes assumptions incorporating local market conditions about key store variables including sales growth rates gross margin and controllable expenses such as store payroll and occupancy expense as well as asset residual values or lease rates an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 

we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations which requires discounting projected future cash flows this involves making assumptions regarding both a location’s future cash flows as described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours 

we use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for closure this involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated the information includes comparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these assets 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows including estimated sales margin and controllable expenses assumptions about market performance for operating locations and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during fiscal year 2018 the company recorded impairment charges totaling 331 million within selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values our actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment losses in the event that our estimates vary from actual results we may record additional impairment losses which could be material to our results of operations 

store closing lease obligations 

description 

when locations under operating leases are closed we recognize a liability for the fair value of future contractual obligations associated with the leased location the fair value of the store closing lease obligation is determined using an expected present 

value cash flow model incorporating future minimum lease payments property taxes utilities common area maintenance and other ongoing expenses net of estimated sublease income and other recoverable items discounted at a creditadjusted risk free rate the expected present value cash flow model uses a probability weighted scenario approach that assigns varying cash flows to certain scenarios based on the expected likelihood of outcomes estimating the fair value involves making assumptions regarding estimated sublease income by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated the information includes comparable lease rates of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for leasing these assets subsequent changes to the liability including a change resulting from a revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flows are recognized in the period of the change 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our store closing lease liability calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows primarily related to estimated sublease income and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during 2018 133 stores under operating lease were closed we recorded 341 million of expense for store closing lease obligations during 2018 these charges include 319 million related to new liabilities recorded during 2018 and 22 million of adjustments related to previously recorded liabilities 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the expected future cash flows of closed locations under operating leases during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in estimating expected future cash flows our store closing lease obligation losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated losses a 10 change in the store closing lease liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 27 million for fiscal year 2018 

goodwill 

description 

goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at least annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below the operating segment level the evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary if after assessing qualitative factors we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test used to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of impairment loss compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill fair value represents the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on a combination of an income approach based on discounted future cash flows and a market approach based on market multiples applied to free cash flow if the fair value exceeds carrying value then no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the income tax effect from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit if applicable is considered in determining the goodwill impairment loss 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including store growth rates existing store sales growth rates forecasting expenses and selecting appropriate discount rates 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 we determined our canadian retail and canadian distribution reporting units were impaired we recorded an impairment loss related to the canadian reporting units of 952 million within selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings which represents the entire amount of goodwill allocated to these reporting units 

the carrying value of goodwill as of february 1 2019  was 303 million  the fair value of the us home improvement reporting unit is substantially in excess of the carrying value and we therefore do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

selfinsurance 

description 

we are selfinsured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation automobile general and product liability extended protection plan and certain medical and dental claims our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable is limited to 2 million per occurrence involving workers’ compensation 75 million per occurrence involving general or product liability and 10 million per occurrence involving automobile we do not have any insurance coverage for selfinsured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims selfinsurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for selfinsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during 2018  our selfinsurance liability increased  approximately 63 million  to 953 million  as of february 1 2019  

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposures including payroll sales and vehicle units as well as the frequency lag and severity of claims 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded selfinsurance liabilities a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 71 million for 2018  a 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately 21 million for 2018

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and consists primarily of fixedrate instruments therefore providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instruments 

commodity price risk 

we purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control we believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices the selling prices of these commodity products are influenced in part by the market price we pay which is determined by industry supply and demand 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition and result of operations

the home improvement retail environment like the retail environment generally is rapidly evolving and adapting our business concept to respond to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and their changing demographics is critical to our future success our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to the economic social style and other trends that affect demographic and consumer preferences in a variety of our merchandise categories and service offerings customers’ expectations about how they wish to research purchase and receive products and services have also evolved it is difficult to predict the mix of products and services that our customers will demand failure to identify such trends adapt our business concept and implement change growth and productivity initiatives successfully could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for the home improvement products and services we sell the rate of growth of our business our market share and results of operations 

we may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on omnichannel sales and marketing presence if we fail to deliver the capabilities required to execute on them 

our interactions with customers has evolved into an omnichannel experience as they increasingly are using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business omnichannel retail is quickly evolving and we must anticipate and meet our customers’ expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors our customerfacing technology systems must appeal to our customers function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience the success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and changing demographics 

will require us to deliver large complex programs requiring more integrated planning initiative prioritization and program sequencing these initiatives will require new competencies in many positions and our management employees and contractors will have to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access our results of operations financial condition or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we fail to provide a consistent experience for our customers regardless of sales channel if our technology systems do not meet our customers’ expectations if we are unable to counteract new developments and innovations implemented by our competitors or if we are unable to attract retain and manage the talent succession of additional personnel at various levels of the company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic initiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly changing retail environment 

our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer employee vendor or company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems assets and such information 

cyberattacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving and high profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major us companies including several large retailers despite widespread recognition of the cyberattack threat and improved data protection methods as with many other retailers we receive and store certain personal information about our customers employees and vendors additionally we use thirdparty service providers for certain services such as authentication content delivery backoffice support and other functions and we provide such thirdparty service providers with personal information necessary for the services concerned despite our continued vigilance and investment in information security we or our thirdparty service providers cannot guarantee that we or they are able to adequately anticipate or prevent a breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized access to destruction misuse or release of personal information or other sensitive data it can be difficult to preempt or detect everevolving forms of cyberattacks if a ransomware attack occurs it is possible that we could be prevented from accessing our own data our or our service providers’ information security may also be compromised because of human errors including by employees or system errors our and our service providers’ systems are additionally vulnerable to a number of other causes such as power outages computer viruses technology system failures or catastrophic events in the event that our systems are breached or damaged for any reason we may also suffer loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to our business operations while such breach or damage is being remedied should these events occur the unauthorized disclosure loss or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation drive existing and potential customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions or potential liability including possible litigation and punitive damages a security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of data from our or our thirdparty service providers’ information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks and require dedication of substantial resources to manage the aftermath of such a breach data privacy and cybersecurity laws in the united states and internationally are constantly changing and in the united states alone we may be subject to regulation at both the federal and state level in order to maintain our compliance with such laws as they come to fruition we may sustain increased costs in order to continually evaluate our policies and processes and adapt to new requirements that are or become applicable to us as the regulatory environment relating to retailers’ and other companies’ obligation to protect personal information becomes stricter a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines other regulatory sanctions or government investigation and potentially to lawsuits brought by private individuals regulators or states’ attorney general 

we could be adversely affected by the failure to adequately protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or claims by third parties that we infringe their intellectual property rights 

our proprietary rights in our trademarks trade names service marks domain names copyrights patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business we rely on a combination of trademark law patent law copyright law trade secret protections and contractual arrangements such as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights maintenance and when necessary enforcement of our intellectual property rights require expenditure of financial and managerial resources and despite our efforts we may not always be able to effectively protect all of such rights we may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own additionally our trade secrets are vulnerable to public disclosure by our own employees or as a result of a breach of or damage to our systems which could result in theft of our proprietary property we may also be subject to intellectual property infringement lawsuits brought by third parties against us claiming that our operations products or services infringe third party rights whether meritorious or not including patent and trademark rights which can be time consuming and costly to defend or settle and may cause significant diversion of management attention and result in substantial monetary damages injunctive orders against us unfavorable royaltybearing licensing agreements or bad publicity 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit cards debit cards credit accounts our private label and cobranded credit cards gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing and physical bank checks and we may offer different payment options over time these payment options subject us to many compliance requirements including but not limited to compliance with payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements rules governing electronic funds transfers and payment card industry data security standards they also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks gift cards and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omnichannel sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

access to the internet from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them our websites including lowescom and lowesforproscom are a sales channel for our products and are also a method of making product project and other relevant information available to our customers that impacts our instore sales additionally we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire inform crosssell establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service ransomware or other cyberattacks or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of lowe’s as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services 

if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists with expanded skill sets or corporate support staff with the capabilities of delivering on strategic objectives we could lose sales to our competitors and our labor costs resulting from operations or the execution of corporate strategies could be negatively affected 

our customers whether they are homeowners renters or commercial businesses expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide we compete with other retailers for many of our sales associates and specialists and we invest significantly in them with respect to training and development to strive for high engagement increasingly our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets including in some instances the ability to do inhome or telephone sales a critical challenge we face is attracting and retaining a sufficiently diverse workforce that can deliver relevant culturally competent and differentiated experiences for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers in fact in many of our stores our employees must be able to serve customers whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own additionally in order to deliver on the omnichannel expectations of our customers we rely on the specialized training and capabilities of corporate support staff which are broadly sought after by our competitors if we are unable to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our results of operations could be negatively affected furthermore our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to a variety of external factors including wage rates the availability of and competition for talent health care and other benefit costs our brand image and reputation changing demographics and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations periodically we are subject to labor organizing efforts and if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect how we operate our business and adversely affect our labor costs and our ability to retain a qualified workforce 

if we do not successfully manage the transition associated with the retirement of our chief executive officer and the appointment of a new chief executive officer it could be viewed negatively by our customers and shareholders and could have an adverse impact on our business 

on march 26 2018 we announced that robert a niblock plans to retire as chairman of the board president and chief executive officer after a 25year career with the company the board of directors has initiated a search for his successor and in the interim mr niblock will remain in his current role such leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and 

an inadequate transition may cause disruption to our business including to our relationships with our customers suppliers vendors and employees it may also make it more difficult to hire and retain key employees 

positively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is critical to our business success and if our public image and reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers vendors and store associates and specialists and consequently our business and results of operations 

our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at lowe’s our vendors want to do business with lowe’s and our sales associates and specialists want to work for lowe’s we must continue to manage preserve and grow lowe’s public image and reputation any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence reduce demand for our products and services affect our relationships with current and future vendors impact our results of operations and affect our ability to retain and recruit store associates and specialists the significant expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents 

strategic transactions such as our acquisition of rona and maintenance supply headquarters involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous uncertainties and risks 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions joint ventures investments and other growth market and geographic expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales cost savings synergies and other various benefits our ability to deliver the expected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks including our ability to integrate personnel labor models financial it and other systems successfully disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management hiring additional management and other critical personnel and increasing the scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations additionally any impairment of goodwill or other assets acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any strategic transaction may materially reduce our earnings our shareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions we may not realize any anticipated benefits from such transactions we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business or joint venture and we may be exposed to litigation in connection with the strategic transaction further we may finance these strategic transactions by incurring additional debt which could increase leverage or impact our ability to access capital in the future 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales profitability cash flows and financial condition 

product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe’s and our brand image if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement action and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities as a result lowe’s reputation as a retailer of high quality products and services including both national and lowe’s private brands could suffer and impact customer loyalty 

we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively or if they develop a substantially more effective or lower cost means of meeting customer needs resulting in a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the principal competitive factors in our industry include convenience customer service quality and price of merchandise and services instock levels and merchandise assortment and presentation we face growing competition from online and omnichannel retailers who have a similar product or service offering customers are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine realtime product availability and price using digital tools our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our results 

our inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national and international brand names we also have relationships with certain suppliers to enable us to sell proprietary products which differentiate us from other retailers the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business many of these vendors and service providers have certain products or specialized skills needed to support our business concept and our strategies if these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or are unable to perform as expected or if we fail to manage them properly or we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to replace them 

if our domestic or international supply chain or our fulfillment network for our products is ineffective or disrupted for any reason or if these operations are subject to trade policy changes our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we source stock and sell products from domestic and international vendors and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success we source a large number of our products from foreign manufacturers with china being the dominant import source the current united states administration has signaled the possibility of major changes in certain tax and trade policies tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products and the exit or renegotiation of certain trade agreements including the north american free trade act and the rules of the world trade organization while it is not possible to predict whether or when any such changes will occur or what form they may take because we source a large percentage of our merchandise from outside the united states major changes in tax or trade policies tariffs or trade relations could adversely affect our business results of operations effective income tax rate liquidity and net income in addition other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in united states trade policy and regulations 

financial instability among key vendors political instability and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain changes in the total costs in our supply chain fuel labor and currency exchange rates port labor disputes and security the outbreak of pandemics weatherrelated events natural disasters work stoppages shipping capacity restraints changes in trade policy retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the united states or a major source country tariffs or duties fluctuations in currency exchange rates and transport availability capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs additionally as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience delays in inventory increased delivery costs or merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to effectively manage our thirdparty installers could result in increased operational and legal risks and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we use thirdparty installers to provide installation services to our customers and as the general contractor we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors including the management of the permitting licensing and quality of our thirdparty installers our failure to effectively manage such requirements the thirdparty installers and our internal processes regarding installation services could result in lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could negatively affect our business 

operating internationally presents unique challenges including some that have required us to adapt our store operations merchandising marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada and mexico our business and results of operations could be negatively affected if we are unable to effectively address these challenges 

we expect continued store growth over the next five years in canada and mexico expanding internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks and slow the anticipated rate of such expansion our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions in which we currently operate or may operate in the future could be negatively affected by a variety of factors including unfavorable political or economic factors adverse tax consequences volatility in foreign currency exchange rates increased difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights costs and difficulties of managing international operations challenges with identifying and contracting with local suppliers and other risks created as a result of differences in culture laws and regulations these factors could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

we must comply with various and multiple laws and regulations that differ substantially in each area where we operate changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities or our inability to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

laws and regulations at the local regional state federal and international levels change frequently and the changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors if we fail to comply with these laws rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied we may be subject to government enforcement action litigation damage to our reputation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties and increased cost of regulatory compliance any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance these laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to import and export requirements us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws rules and regulations there can be no certainty that our employees and third parties with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or laws many of these laws rules and regulations are complex evolving and are subject to varying interpretations and enforcement actions any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies as a result of enforcing existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry country or practice 

future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements negatively affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and in the future will become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments furthermore defending against these proceedings may require a diversion of management’s attention and resources none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved individually or collectively is considered material 

our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain improve upgrade and expand those systems 

our efforts to provide an omnichannel experience for our customers include investing in maintaining and making ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as sales inventory replenishment merchandise ordering project design and execution transportation receipt processing and fulfillment our systems are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events power outages viruses malicious attacks and telecommunications failures and as a result we may incur significant expense data loss as well as an erosion of customer confidence additionally we continually make investments in our systems which may introduce disruption our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain improve upgrade and expand those systems 

liquidity and access to capital rely on efficient rational and open capital markets and are dependent on lowe’s credit strength our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business financial performance and results of operations 

we have relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund our working capital needs our access to these markets depends on our strong credit ratings the overall condition of debt capital markets and our operating performance disruption in the financial markets or an erosion of our credit strength or declines on our credit rating could impact negatively our ability to meet capital requirements or fund working capital needs 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales 

many us and global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of slow economic growth or recession decreasing housing turnover or home price appreciation volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of borrowing to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending high rates of unemployment consumer debt levels fluctuations in fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters and acts of both domestic and international terrorism sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects adverse development in these factors could result in a decrease in home improvement activity which could reduce demand for our products and services

executive overview 

net sales for 2017  were 686 billion  a 55  increase over fiscal year 2016  the increase in total sales was driven primarily by an increase in comparable sales the addition of rona in may of 2016 new stores and the acquisition of maintenance supply headquarters in june 2017 partially offset by the 53 rd  week impacts in the prior year comparable sales increased 40  driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 41 and a comparable transaction decrease of 01 rona new stores and maintenance supply headquarters contributed 22 07 and 03 respectively to the sales growth for 2017  the 53 rd  week in 2016 and resulting week shift negatively impacted 2017 sales growth by 13 net earnings increased 115  to 34 billion  diluted earnings per common share increased 179  in fiscal year 2017 to 409  from 347  in 2016  adjusting 2017  and 2016  amounts for certain significant discrete items not originally contemplated in the business outlooks for those respective years adjusted diluted earnings per common share increased 100  in fiscal year 2017  to 439  from 399  in 2016  see discussion on nongaap financial measures beginning on page 22 

for 2017  cash flows from operating activities were approximately 51 billion  with 11 billion  used for capital expenditures continuing to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders the company repurchased 391 million  shares of stock through the share repurchase program for 31 billion  and paid 13 billion  in dividends during the year 

during the year we focused on investing in capabilities to support the diy difm and pro customers’ needs and expanding our home improvement reach we made further progress on advancing our customer service capabilities through our omnichannel assets empowering customers across the most relevant moments of their project journey we leveraged our investments in lowescom to provide an upgraded online shopping experience and advanced our online platform by making it easier for customers to engage with our inhome project specialists and request services online our project specialists represent a critical element of our omnichannel offering and a differentiated capability in capturing project demand for the difm customer in addition we continued to build upon our strong foundation with the pro customer by focusing on our breadth and depth of inventory portfolio of brands and enhancing digital focus on lowesforproscom the acquisition of maintenance supply headquarters during 2017 in addition to the central wholesalers inc acquisition in the prior year will provide an opportunity to improve and expand our ability to serve the multifamily housing industry we also continued to make progress on the integration of rona including the rollout of appliances to approximately 100 locations as well as further optimizing our shared supplier relationships and procurement efforts during 2017 we converted five rona stores to a lowe’sbranded store as part of our initiative to convert certain larger format locations where we are combining the best elements of lowe’s store experience merchandising and brands with rona’s strong pro offerings 

while we are pleased with the strategic milestones we achieved this year we are actively working to improve conversion gross margin and inventory management to ensure greater success in the future we will be taking the necessary actions to transform our supply chain better empower our associates through training programs and the reengineering of key processes such as pick up in store and centralized project quoting and continue to deliver compelling product experiences 

in 2018 we look to capitalize on a strong macroeconomic environment and see an opportunity to invest incremental cash flow from corporate tax reform to accelerate our strategic priorities we will be focusing our investments on the following six strategic areas to build upon our strong foundation which will be instrumental to further strengthening our competitiveness and enhancing our position as the omnichannel project authority 

 

through these six strategic areas we are focusing our resources on what is most relevant to the customer building the capabilities required to deliver simple and seamless omnichannel experiences for diy difm and pro customers and engaging them in the moments that matter most

nongaap financial measures 

return on invested capital 

return on invested capital roic is calculated using a nongaap financial measure we believe roic is a meaningful metric for investors because it represents management’s measure of how effectively the company is using capital to generate profits although roic is a common financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating roic accordingly the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roic we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roic before comparing its roic to ours 

we define roic as trailing four quarters’ net operating profit after tax nopat divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters nopat is a nongaap financial measure and net earnings is considered to be the most comparable gaap financial measure to nopat the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation of nopat to net earnings the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows 



 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

adjusted diluted earnings per share is considered a nongaap financial measure the company believes this nongaap financial measure provides useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating what management considers the company’s core financial performance adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of certain discrete items not contemplated in the company’s business outlooks for 2017 2016 and 2015 unless otherwise noted the income tax effect of these adjustments is calculated using the marginal rates for the respective periods 

adjusted diluted earnings per share should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful indicator of the company’s diluted earnings per common share as prepared in accordance with gaap the company’s methods of determining this nongaap financial measure may differ from the method used by other companies for this or similar nongaap financial measures accordingly these nongaap measures may not be comparable to the measures used by other companies 



 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016 

for the purpose of the following discussion comparable store sales comparable store average ticket and comparable store customer transactions are based upon comparable 52week periods 

net sales –  net sales increased   55  to 686 billion  in 2017  the increase in total sales was driven by 40 comparable sales growth the addition of rona during the second quarter of 2016 22 new stores 07 and the acquisition of maintenance supply headquarters 03 partially offset by the impact of the 53rd week in 2016 and resulting week shift in 2017 13 rona retail sales are included in comparable sales beginning in q2 2017 the comparable sales increase of 40  in 2017  was driven primarily by a 41 increase in comparable average ticket offset by a 01 decrease in comparable customer transactions comparable sales during each quarter of the fiscal year as reported were 19 in the first quarter 45 in the second quarter 57 in the third quarter and 41 in the fourth quarter 

all of our product categories experienced comparable sales increases for the year during 2017  we experienced comparable sales increases above the company average in appliances lumber  building materials rough plumbing  electrical and tools  hardware strong brand and service advantages in appliances as well as our continued investment in customer experience both instore and online drove strong comparable sales during the year lumber  building materials benefited from an increased demand for hurricanerelated products an increase in pro demand and inflation we also achieved strong comparable sales in rough plumbing  electrical and tools  hardware driven by continued improvements in brand relevance and demand from the pro customer geographically all of our 14 us regions experienced positive comparable store sales 

during the fourth quarter of 2017  we experienced comparable sales increases in nine of 11 product categories as well as flat comparable sales in lawn  garden and fashion fixtures comparable sales increases were above the company average in appliances lumber  building materials rough plumbing  electrical and tools  hardware strong brand and service advantages in appliances as well as our continued investment in customer experience both instore and online drove double digit comparable sales during the quarter we achieved strong comparable sales in lumber  building materials driven by continued recovery efforts from hurricane irma and harvey inflation and strong demand from the pro customer our holiday performance combined with our strategy to serve demand for critical items customers needed during colder temperatures and winter storms drove performance in rough plumbing  electrical and tools  hardware geographically 13 of 14 us regions experienced increases in comparable sales 

gross margin  – gross margin of 3411  for 2017  represented a 44  basis point decrease  from 2016  gross margin was negatively impacted approximately 25 basis points due to competitive actions approximately 10 basis points due to mix of products sold and approximately 10 basis points due to damaged clearance and nonproductive inventory 

during the fourth quarter of 2017  gross margin of 3373   decreased   68  basis points as a percentage of sales gross margin was negatively impacted approximately 45 basis points due to rate pressures associated with damaged clearance and nonproductive inventory as well as competitive actions and inflation in lumber in addition gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 10 basis points due to mix of products sold and approximately 10 basis points due to higher shrink rates 

sga  – sga expense for 2017   leveraged   87  basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2016  this was primarily driven by 59 basis points of leverage attributable to the prior year noncash impairment charge related to the investment in the australian joint venture and the current year sale of our interest in the australian joint venture 27 basis points of leverage in operating salaries 15 basis points of leverage primarily due to the prior year writeoff of canceled technologyenabled projects and 12 basis points of leverage associated with goodwill and longlived asset impairments related to orchard operations in the prior year these were partially offset by 13 basis points of deleverage in outside delivery due to shifting a portion of our deliveries to third party providers in order to meet increased demand in appliances 12 basis points of deleverage due to the prior year settlement of the foreign currency option contract entered into in advance of the rona acquisition and 10 basis points of deleverage in risk insurance 

for the fourth quarter of 2017  sga expense deleveraged   29  basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 this was primarily driven by 42 basis points of deleverage due to the onetime tax reform bonus 21 basis points of deleverage in outside delivery due to a shift in our delivery strategy and 14 basis points of deleverage in advertising as a result of our efforts to amplify consumer messaging these were partially offset by 53 basis points of leverage associated with severance and related costs in the prior year for organizational changes in the stores distribution centers and corporate offices 32 basis points in incentive compensation due to lower attainment levels compared to the prior year and 21 basis points of leverage in employee insurance costs certain other costs also deleveraged as a result of the week shift related to the 53 rd week in the prior fiscal year 

depreciation and amortization  – depreciation and amortization expense leveraged   18  basis points for 2017  compared to 2016   primarily due to the increase in sales and assets becoming fully depreciated partially offset by the incremental expense due to the acquisition of maintenance supply headquarters property less accumulated depreciation decreased to 197 billion  at february 2 2018  compared to 199 billion  at february 3 2017  as of february 2 2018  and february 3 2017  we owned   79  of our stores which included stores on leased land 

depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was flat compared to the prior year 

interest – net  – net interest expense is comprised of the following 



net interest expense decreased in 2017 primarily as a result of the cash tender offer to purchase and retire 16 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes the payoff of scheduled debts at maturity and the favorable settlement of accrued interest related to uncertain tax issues these were partially offset by the issuance of unsecured notes in april 2016 and may 2017 respectively 

loss on extinguishment of debt  during the first quarter of 2017 we repurchased and retired 16 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debt resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 464 million 

income tax provision   our effective income tax rate was 372  in 2017  compared to 405  in 2016  during 2017 the company was impacted by the passage of the tax cuts and job act the tax act which provided a reduction in the statutory federal rate from 35 to 21 the effective date of january 1 2018 resulted in the usage of a blended rate for the year of 337 for the company the new rate of 21 was applied against the company’s deferred balances resulting in a decrease of its overall deferred tax assets the rate was also impacted by the onetime repatriation tax enacted under internal revenue code section 965 in 2016 final and temporary regulations were issued under internal revenue code section 987 which negatively impacted the company’s income tax rate due to the adjustment of deferred tax assets associated with cumulative currency translation adjustments related to certain of the company’s international operations in addition the company recorded a deferred tax asset related to the investment in the australian joint venture with woolworths associated with the noncash impairment charges that occurred during both 2016 and 2015 the deferred tax asset associated with these losses was offset with the establishment of a full valuation allowance due to the fact the benefit of these losses can only be realized to the extent the company has available capital gains for offset and no present or future capital gains have been identified through which this deferred tax asset can be realized 

our effective income tax rates were 413 and 403 for the three months ended february 2 2018  and february 3 2017  respectively the increase in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the enactment of the tax act effective january 1 2018 the federal rate was lowered from 35 to 21 as part of the tax act which resulted in a tax benefit of 58 million for the year the company remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new federal rate which led to a onetime tax expense of approximately 56 million to reduce the company’s overall federal deferred tax asset in addition the company recorded a 22 million provisional tax expense for the onetime transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015 

for the purpose of the following discussion comparable store sales comparable store average ticket and comparable store customer transactions are based upon comparable 53week periods 

net sales –  net sales increased 101 to 650 billion in 2016 the increase in total sales was driven by an increase in comparable sales the addition of rona the 53 rd  week and new stores the addition of rona and the 53 rd week contributed 38 and 16 respectively to the sales growth for 2016 the comparable sales increase of 42 in 2016 was driven by a 25 increase in comparable average ticket and a 16 increase in comparable customer transactions comparable sales during each quarter of the fiscal year as reported were 73 in the first quarter 20 in the second quarter 27 in the third quarter and 51 in the fourth quarter 

all of our product categories experienced comparable sales increases for the year during 2016 we experienced comparable sales increases above the company average in lumber  building materials appliances tools  hardware and lawn  garden performance in lumber  building materials and tools  hardware was driven by strong demand from the pro customer tools  hardware also benefited from customers’ positive response to our continued enhancements in product assortment and brand relevance strong brand and service advantages in appliances as well as our continued investment in customer experience both instore and online drove solid comparable sales during the year an extended outdoor selling season as a result of favorable weather conditions positively impacted sales within lawn  garden geographically all of our 14 us regions experienced increases in comparable store sales with the strongest results in the south and northwest 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 we experienced comparable sales increases in all of our product categories with comparable sales increases above the company average in appliances kitchens lawn  garden lumber  building materials and rough plumbing  electrical strong brand and service advantages in appliances as well as our successful holiday events drove solid comparable sales during the quarter performance in kitchens was driven by our strategy to focus on the entire kitchen project investment in project specialists and targeted promotions we experienced strength in several outdoor project categories including lawn  garden lumber  building materials and rough plumbing  electrical warmer weather particularly in the south and west drove strong demand for outdoor projects in lawn  garden lumber  building materials benefited from continued recovery efforts from hurricane matthew and louisiana flooding as well as strong performance with the pro customer 

gross margin  – gross margin of 3455 for 2016 represented a 27 basis point decrease from 2015 the change was primarily driven by 23 basis points decrease due to purchase price adjustments to rona’s opening inventory balance and 11 basis points decrease due to targeted promotional activity partially offset by 9 basis points increase due to cost reductions associated with value improvement efforts 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 gross margin of 3441 decreased 25 basis points as a percentage of sales gross margin was negatively impacted 25 basis points by the rona business primarily driven by purchase price adjustments to their opening inventory balance and mix of business 

sga  – sga expense for 2016 leveraged 61 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2015 this was primarily driven by 45 basis points of net leverage associated with impairment charges recorded during 2016 versus 2015 relating to our australian joint venture with woolworths we experienced 15 basis points of leverage associated with incentive compensation 14 basis points in employee insurance costs and 12 basis points related to the settlement of the foreign currency option contract entered into in anticipation of the rona acquisition this was partially offset by 15 basis points of deleverage associated with the writeoff of cancelled technologyenabled projects as part of an ongoing review of our strategic initiatives and 12 basis points associated with severance and related costs for organizational changes in the stores distribution centers and corporate offices 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 sga expense leveraged 445 basis points as a percentage of sales due primarily to 403 basis points of leverage associated with a noncash impairment charge resulting from our decision to exit our australian joint venture recorded in the fourth quarter of the prior year we experienced 59 basis points of leverage in benefits primarily related to incentive compensation due to lower attainment levels compared to the same quarter of the prior year these were partially offset by 53 basis points of deleverage associated with separation events for organizational changes in the stores distribution centers and corporate offices store environment operating salaries and certain other costs also leveraged as a result of sales growth 

depreciation and amortization  – depreciation and amortization expense leveraged 24 basis points for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the increase in sales from the 53rd week partially offset by incremental expense due to the acquisition of rona property less accumulated depreciation increased to 199 billion at february 3 2017 compared to 196 billion at january 29 2016 as of february 3 2017 and january 29 2016 we owned 79 and 86 of our stores respectively which included stores on leased land 

interest – net  – net interest expense is comprised of the following 



net interest expense increased due primarily to an increase in total debt compared to the prior year 

income tax provision   our effective income tax rate was 405 in 2016 compared to 424 in 2015 during 2016 the company was impacted by the issuance of the us internal revenue service internal revenue code section 987 which negatively impacted the income tax rate due to the adjustment of deferred tax assets associated with   cumulative currency translation adjustments related to certain of the company’s international operations in addition the company recorded a deferred tax asset related to the investment in the australian joint venture with woolworths associated with the noncash impairment charges that occurred during both 2016 and 2015 the deferred tax asset associated with these losses was offset 

with the establishment of a full valuation allowance due to the fact the benefit of these losses can only be realized to the extent the company has available capital gains for offset and no present or future capital gains have been identified through which this deferred tax asset can be realized 

our effective income tax rates were 403 and 961 for the three months ended february 3 2017 and january 29 2016 respectively due to the same factors that impacted the income tax provision in the year 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity 

cash flows from operations supplemented with our shortterm and longterm borrowings have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments that will grow our business and to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases we believe that our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our operations and investments to grow our business pay dividends and fund our share repurchases over the next 12 months 

cash flows provided by operating activities 



cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2017  when compared to 2016  was driven primarily by changes in working capital and was partially offset by an increase in net earnings adjusted for noncash expenses 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2016  when compared to 2015  was driven primarily by an increase in net earnings adjusted for noncash expenses and improved working capital management 

we are forecasting cash flows from operations of approximately 65 billion for 2018 which includes 750 million of expected incremental cash flow benefit related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 

cash flows used in investing activities 



net cash used in investing activities primarily consist of transactions related to capital expenditures and business acquisitions 

capital expenditures 

our capital expenditures generally consist of investments in our existing stores expansion plans corporate programs and our existing distribution network capital expenditures were 11 billion in 2017 and 12 billion in 2016 and 2015 the following table provides the allocation of capital expenditures for 2017  2016  and 2015  



our 2018  capital expenditures forecast is approximately 17 billion the increase in our forecast relative to historical capital expenditures is primarily attributable to incremental cash flow benefit related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the following table provides the allocation of our fiscal 2018 capital expenditures forecast 



business acquisitions 

we continue to seek compelling strategic investment opportunities to further expand our home improvement reach in 2017 we paid 509 million net of cash received to acquire maintenance supply headquarters which is expected to enable us to deepen and broaden our relationship with the pro customer and better serve their needs in 2016 we used 23 billion net of cash received to acquire rona which enabled us to accelerate our growth strategy in the canadian home improvement market see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our business acquisitions 

cash flows used in financing activities 



net cash used in financing activities primarily consist of transactions related to our shortterm borrowings longterm debt share repurchases and cash dividend payments 

shortterm borrowing facilities 

we have an unsecured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks the 2016 credit facility which provides for borrowings up to 175 billion and supports our commercial paper program the amount available to be drawn under the 2016 credit facility is reduced by the amount of borrowings under our commercial paper program all of our shortterm borrowings in 2017  2016  and 2015  were under the commercial paper program our commercial paper program along with cash flows generated from operations is typically utilized during our fourth fiscal quarter to build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season the following table includes additional information related to our shortterm borrowings for 2017  2016  and 2015  



the 2016 credit facility expires in november 2021 and contains customary representations warranties and covenants we were in compliance with those covenants at february 2 2018  subject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the 2016 credit facility the company may increase the aggregate availability by an additional 500 million see note 6  to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our shortterm borrowings 

longterm debt 

the following table includes additional information related to the company’s longterm debt for 2017  2016  and 2015  



in 2017 we paid approximately 20 billion to purchase 16 billion of our higher coupon notes prior to maturity in connection with a cash tender offer we issued 30 billion of unsecured notes to fund the tender offer finance current year maturities and for other general corporate purposes which included share repurchases capital expenditures strategic investments and working capital needs 

in 2016 we issued 33 billion of unsecured notes to fund the acquisition of rona finance current year maturities and for other general corporate purposes which included share repurchases capital expenditures strategic investments and working capital needs 

in 2015 we issued 175 billion of unsecured notes to finance current year maturities and for other general corporate purposes which included share repurchases capital expenditures strategic investments and working capital needs 

our ratio of debt to capital equity plus debt was 743 and 709 as of february 2 2018  and february 3 2017  respectively 

see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information related to our longterm debt 

share repurchases 

we have an ongoing share repurchase program authorized by the company’s board of directors that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private offmarket transactions we also withhold shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding liabilities shares repurchased are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status the following table provides on a settlement date basis the total number of shares repurchased average price paid per share and the total amount paid for share repurchases for 2017  2016  and 2015  



as of february 2 2018  we had 69 billion  remaining under our share repurchase program with no expiration date we expect to repurchase shares totaling 25 billion in 2018 see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding share repurchases 

dividends 

in 2017 we increased our quarterly dividend payment 17 to 041 per share our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared the following table provides additional information related to our dividend payments for 2017  2016  and 2015  



capital resources 

we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both shortterm and longterm bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new longterm debt the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected however by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard  poor’s sp and moody’s as of april 2 2018  which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds our debt ratings have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets although we currently do not expect a downgrade in our debt ratings our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 



there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price in addition we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate significant cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at february 2 2018  



 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory 

description 

we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels sales trends and historical experience during 2017  our reserve increased  approximately 18 million  to 77 million  as of february 2 2018  

we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories during 2017  the inventory shrinkage reserve increased  approximately 23 million  to 212 million  as of february 2 2018  

in addition we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business principally as a result of purchase volumes sales early payments or promotions of vendors’ products generally these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor’s product therefore we treat these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors’ products are recorded as an offset to the related expense 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions however changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves likewise changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and results of physical inventories we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value 

for vendor funds we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves however it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves a 10 change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 4 million for 2017  a 10 change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 13 million for 2017  

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective longterm estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 

longlived asset impairment 

description 

we review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable when evaluating locations for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead 

we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to longlived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location’s asset carrying values may not be recoverable for operating locations our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a 12month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment including individual locations’ execution of their operating plans and local market conditions including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe’s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location’s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location management makes assumptions incorporating local market conditions about key store variables including sales growth rates gross margin and controllable expenses such as store payroll and occupancy expense as well as asset residual values or lease rates an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 

we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations which requires discounting projected future cash flows this involves making assumptions regarding both a location’s future cash flows as described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations for longlived assets require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows including estimated sales margin and controllable expenses assumptions about market performance for operating locations and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 reduction in projected sales used to estimate future cash flows for operating locations that experienced a triggering event would not have had a significant impact to impairment losses recognized during 2017 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values our actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment losses 

goodwill 

description 

goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at least annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below the operating segment level the evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary if after assessing qualitative factors we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount then the twostep goodwill impairment test is necessary 

the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill fair value represents the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on discounted future cash flows if the fair value exceeds carrying value then no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss the second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination then the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including store growth rates existing store sales growth rates forecasting expenses and selecting appropriate discount rates 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

the carrying value of goodwill as of february 2 2018  was 13 billion  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

selfinsurance 

description 

we are selfinsured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation automobile general and product liability extended protection plan and certain medical and dental claims our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable is limited to 2 million per occurrence involving workers’ compensation 5 million per occurrence involving general or product liability and 10 million per occurrence involving automobile we do not have any insurance coverage for selfinsured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims selfinsurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for selfinsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during 2017  our selfinsurance liability increased  approximately 59 million  to 890 million  as of february 2 2018  

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposures including payroll sales and vehicle units as well as the frequency lag and severity of claims 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded selfinsurance liabilities a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 56 million for 2017  a 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately 19 million for 2017  

revenue recognition 

description 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the effects of future events that cannot be determined with certainty 

we sell separatelypriced extended protection plan contracts under a lowe’sbranded program for which the company is ultimately selfinsured the company recognizes revenues from extended protection plan sales on a straightline basis over the respective contract term extended protection plan contract terms primarily range from one to four years from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer’s warranty as applicable the company consistently groups and evaluates extended protection plan contracts based on the characteristics of the underlying products and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected losses a loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected costs of performing services under the contracts exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition costs and related deferred revenue associated with the contracts   

deferred revenues associated with the extended protection plan contracts increased 40 million to 803 million  as of february 2 2018  

we defer revenue and cost of sales associated with settled transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed revenue is deferred based on the actual amounts received we use historical gross margin rates to estimate the adjustment to cost of sales for these transactions during 2017  deferred revenues associated with these transactions increased 76 million to 831 million as of february 2 2018  

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

for extended protection plans there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected losses as a result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contracts and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contracts there is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of costs of performing services under these contracts 

for the deferral of revenue and cost of sales associated with transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed there is judgment inherent in our estimates of gross margin rates 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contracts during the past three fiscal years we currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract losses on our extended protection plan contracts although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected losses under the extended protection plan contracts it is possible that actual results could differ from our estimates in addition if future evidence indicates that the costs of performing services under these contracts are incurred on other than a straightline basis the timing of revenue recognition under these contracts could change a 10 change in the amount of revenue recognized in 2017  under these contracts would have affected net earnings by approximately 23 million 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to reverse net sales and cost of sales related to amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates related to the impact to cost of sales for these transactions however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may incur additional income or expense a 10 change in the estimate of the gross margin rates applied to these transactions would have affected net earnings by approximately 12 million in 2017  

disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements 

we speak throughout this annual report in forwardlooking statements about our future but particularly in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the words “believe” “expect” “will” “should” “suggest” and other similar expressions are intended to identify those forwardlooking statements while we believe our expectations are reasonable they are not guarantees of future performance our actual results could differ materially from our expectations 

for a detailed description of the risks and uncertainties that we are exposed to you should read item 1a “risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report all forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report or in the case of any document incorporated by reference the date of that document all subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section and in item 1a “risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forwardlooking statements to reflect events circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this annual report 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and consists primarily of fixedrate instruments therefore providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instruments 

commodity price risk 

we purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control we believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices the selling prices of these commodity products are influenced in part by the market price we pay which is determined by industry supply and demand 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition and result of operations

seasonality and working capital 

the retail business in general is subject to seasonal influences and our business is to some extent seasonal historically we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter may june and july and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter november december and january accordingly our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes we fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash 

flows generated from operations but also with shortterm borrowings as needed for more detailed information see the financial condition liquidity and capital resources section in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report

 item 1a  risk factors 

we have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys external research planning processes risk mapping analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational financial environmental reputational strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business for more information about our risk management framework which is administered by our chief financial officer and includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify see the description included in the definitive proxy statement for our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders as defined in item 10 of part iii of this annual report under “board’s role in the risk management process” 

we describe below certain risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition business reputation or business prospects these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended supplemented or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in our future periodic reports on form 10k form 10q and reports on other forms we file with the securities and exchange commission all forwardlooking statements about our future results of operations or other matters made by us in this annual report in our annual report to lowe’s shareholders and in our subsequently filed reports to the securities and exchange commission as well as in our press releases and other public communications are qualified by the risks described below 

you should read these risk factors in conjunction with “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this annual report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

we may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address the changing shopping habits demands and demographics of our customers or realize the intended benefits of organizational change initiatives 

the home improvement retail environment like the retail environment generally is rapidly evolving and adapting our business concept to respond to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and their changing demographics is critical to our future success our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to the economic social style and other trends that affect demographic and consumer preferences in a variety of our merchandise categories and service offerings customers’ expectations about how they wish to research purchase and receive products and services have also evolved it is difficult to predict the mix of products and services that our customers will demand failure to identify such trends adapt our business concept and implement change growth and productivity initiatives successfully could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for the home improvement products and services we sell the rate of growth of our business our market share and results of operations 

we may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on omnichannel sales and marketing presence if we fail to deliver the capabilities required to execute on them 

our interactions with customers has evolved into an omnichannel experience as they increasingly are using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business omnichannel retail is quickly evolving and we must anticipate and meet our customers’ expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors our customerfacing technology systems must appeal to our customers function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience the success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and changing demographics will require us to deliver large complex programs requiring more integrated planning initiative prioritization and program sequencing these initiatives will require new competencies in many positions and our management employees and contractors will have to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access our results of operations financial condition or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we fail to provide a consistent experience for our customers regardless of sales channel if our technology systems do not meet our customers’ expectations if we are unable to counteract new developments and innovations implemented by our competitors or if we are unable to attract retain and manage the talent succession of additional personnel at various levels of the company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic initiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly changing retail environment 

our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer employee vendor or company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems assets and such information from the threat of cyberattacks 

cyberattacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving and high profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major us companies including several large retailers despite widespread recognition of the cyberattack threat and improved data protection methods as with many other retailers we receive and store certain personal information about our customers employees and vendors additionally we use thirdparty service providers for services such as authentication content delivery backoffice support and other functions despite our continued vigilance and investment in information security we or our thirdparty service providers may be unable to adequately anticipate or prevent a breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized release of sensitive data should this occur it may have a material adverse effect on our reputation drive customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions or potential liability including possible punitive damages a security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of sensitive data from our or our thirdparty service providers’ information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks in addition as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other companies’ obligation to protect such sensitive data becomes stricter a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit cards debit cards credit accounts our private label and cobranded credit cards gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing and physical bank checks and we may offer different payment options over time these payment options subject us to many compliance requirements including but not limited to compliance with payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements rules governing electronic funds transfers and payment card industry data security standards they also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities 

that may exist in some of these payment systems for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks gift cards and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omnichannel sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

access to the internet from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them our websites including lowescom and lowesforproscom are a sales channel for our products and are also a method of making product project and other relevant information available to our customers that impacts our instore sales additionally we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire inform crosssell establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service ransomware or other cyberattacks or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of lowe’s as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services 

if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists with expanded skill sets or corporate support staff with the capabilities of delivering on strategic objectives we could lose sales to our competitors and our labor costs resulting from operations or the execution of corporate strategies could be negatively affected 

our customers whether they are homeowners renters or commercial businesses expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide we compete with other retailers for many of our sales associates and specialists and we invest significantly in them with respect to training and development to strive for high engagement increasingly our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets including in some instances the ability to do inhome or telephone sales a critical challenge we face is attracting and retaining a sufficiently diverse workforce that can deliver relevant culturally competent and differentiated experiences for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers in fact in many of our stores our employees must be able to serve customers whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own additionally in order to deliver on the omnichannel expectations of our customers we rely on the specialized training and capabilities of corporate support staff which are broadly sought after by our competitors if we are unable to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our results of operations could be negatively affected furthermore our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to a variety of external factors including wage rates the availability of and competition for talent health care and other benefit costs our brand image and reputation changing demographics and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations periodically we are subject to labor organizing efforts and if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect how we operate our business and adversely affect our labor costs and our ability to retain a qualified workforce 

positively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is critical to our business success and if our public image and reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers vendors and store associates and specialists and consequently our business and results of operations 

our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at lowe’s our vendors want to do business with lowe’s and our sales associates and specialists want to work for lowe’s we must continue to manage preserve and grow lowe’s public image and reputation any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence reduce demand for our products and services affect our relationships with current and future vendors impact our results of operations and affect our ability to retain and recruit store associates and specialists the significant expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents 

strategic transactions such as our acquisition of rona involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous uncertainties and risks 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions joint ventures investments and other growth market and geographic expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in 

sales cost savings synergies and other various benefits our ability to deliver the expected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks including our ability to integrate personnel labor models financial it and other systems successfully disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management hiring additional management and other critical personnel and increasing the scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations additionally any impairment of goodwill or other assets acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any strategic transaction may materially reduce our earnings our shareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions and if we do not realize any anticipated benefits from such transactions we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business or joint venture and we may be exposed to litigation in connection with the strategic transaction further we may finance these strategic transactions by incurring additional debt which could increase leverage or impact our ability to access capital in the future 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales profitability cash flows and financial condition 

product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe’s and our brand image if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputational risks actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement action and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities as a result lowe’s reputation as a retailer of high quality products and services including both national and lowe’s private brands could suffer and impact customer loyalty 

we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively or if they develop a substantially more effective or lower cost means of meeting customer needs resulting in a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the principal competitive factors in our industry include convenience customer service quality and price of merchandise and services instock levels and merchandise assortment and presentation we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers who have a similar product or service offering customers are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine realtime product availability and price using digital tools our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our results 

our inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national and international brand names we also have relationships with certain suppliers to enable us to sell proprietary products which differentiate us from other retailers the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business many of these vendors and service providers have certain products or specialized skills needed to support our business concept and our strategies if these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or are unable to perform as expected or if we fail to manage them properly and we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to replace them and potentially in some cases permanently 

if our domestic or international supply chain or our fulfillment network for our products is ineffective or disrupted for any reason or if these operations are subject to trade policy changes our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we source stock and sell products from domestic and international vendors and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success we source a large number of our products from foreign manufacturers with china continuing to be the dominant import source the results of the november 2016 us elections may signal a change in trade policy between the united states and other countries because we source a large percentage of our merchandise from outside the united states major changes in tax policy or trade relations such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported 

merchandise or the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products could adversely affect our business results of operations effective income tax rate liquidity and net income 

financial instability among key vendors political instability and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain changes in the costs of commodities in our supply chain fuel labor and currency exchange rates port labor disputes and security the outbreak of pandemics weatherrelated events natural disasters work stoppages shipping capacity restrains changes in trade policy retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the united states or a major source country tariffs or duties fluctuations in currency exchange rates and transport availability capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs additionally as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience delays in inventory increased delivery costs or merchandise outofstocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence and adversely affect our results of operations 

failure to effectively manage our thirdparty installers could result in increased operational and legal risks and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we use thirdparty installers to provide installation services to our customers and as the general contractor we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors including the management of the permitting licensing and quality of our thirdparty installers our failure to effectively manage such requirements the thirdparty installers and our internal processes regarding installation services could result in lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could negatively affect our business 

operating internationally presents unique challenges including some that have required us to adapt our store operations merchandising marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada and mexico our business and results of operations could be negatively affected if we are unable to effectively address these challenges 

we expect continued store growth over the next five years in canada and mexico expanding internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks and slow the anticipated rate of such expansion our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions in which we currently operate or may operate in the future could be negatively affected by a variety of factors including unfavorable political or economic factors adverse tax consequences volatility in foreign currency exchange rates increased difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights costs and difficulties of managing international operations challenges with identifying and contracting with local suppliers and other risks created as a result of differences in culture laws and regulations these factors could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

we must comply with various and multiple laws and regulations that differ substantially in each area where we operate changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities or our inability to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

laws and regulations at the local regional state federal and international levels change frequently and the changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors if we fail to comply with these laws rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied we may be subject to government enforcement action litigation damage to our reputation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties and increased cost of regulatory compliance any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance these laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to import and export requirements us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws rules and regulations there can be no certainty that our employees and third parties with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or laws many of these laws rules and regulations are complex evolving and are subject to varying interpretations and enforcement actions any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies as a result of enforcing existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry country or practice 

future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements negatively affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and in the future will become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments furthermore defending against these proceedings may require a diversion of management’s attention and resources none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved individually or collectively is considered material 

our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain improve upgrade and expand those systems 

an important part of our efforts to provide an omnichannel experience for our customers include investing in maintaining and making ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as sales inventory replenishment merchandise ordering project design and execution transportation receipt processing and fulfillment our systems are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events power outages viruses malicious attacks telecommunications failures and we may incur significant expense data loss as well as an erosion of customer confidence additionally we continually make investments in our systems which may introduce disruption our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain improve upgrade and expand those systems 

liquidity and access to capital rely on efficient rational and open capital markets and are dependent on lowe’s credit strength our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business financial performance and results of operations 

we have relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund our working capital needs our access to these markets depends on our strong credit ratings the overall condition of debt capital markets and our operating performance disruption in the financial markets or an erosion of our credit strength or declines on our credit rating could impact negatively our ability to meet capital requirements or fund working capital needs 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales 

many us and global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of slow economic growth or recession decreasing housing turnover or home price appreciation volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of borrowing to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending high rates of unemployment consumer debt levels fluctuations in fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters and acts of both domestic and international terrorism sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects adverse development in these factors could result in a decrease in home improvement activity which could reduce demand for our products and services

executive overview 

net sales for 2016 were 650 billion a 101 increase over fiscal year 2015 the increase in total sales was driven by an increase in comparable sales the acquisition of rona in may 2016 the 53 rd  week and new stores comparable sales increased 42 driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 25 and a comparable transaction increase of 16 the addition of rona and the 53 rd week contributed 38 and 16 respectively to the sales growth for 2016 net earnings increased 215 to 31 billion diluted earnings per common share increased 271 in fiscal year 2016 to 347 from 273 in 2015 adjusting 2016 and 2015 amounts for certain significant discrete items not originally contemplated in the business outlooks for those respective years adjusted diluted earnings per common share increased 213 in fiscal year 2016 to 399 from 329 in 2015 see discussion on nongaap financial measures beginning on page 22

throughout 2016 we remained committed to our key priorities including differentiating ourselves with better customer experiences and improving our product and service offering for the pro customer in addition we continued to enhance our omnichannel experiences driving customer engagement by delivering convenience inspiration expertise and efficiency across the most relevant moments of the customer’s project journey 

we continued to leverage our larger store formats and expertise in customer experience design to create product sets to inspire customers to envision a variety of possibilities in their own homes our customer experience design work is rooted in research around customers’ expectations and how they think about home improvement projects whether it is showcasing a series of kitchen vignettes to highlight all the design elements of a kitchen remodel or a smaller project such as a bathroom lighting upgrade we simplify presentation by grouping fixtures by style and collection in order to provide a cohesive decorating solution by providing an integrated assortment of products inspiring and intuitive presentation and display and optimal service components across all selling channels we are able to provide better customer experiences that differentiate us in the marketplace

looking forward 

economic forecasts for 2017 suggest the outlook for the home improvement industry remains favorable as the economy continues to be led by growth in consumer spending the home improvement industry is poised to grow its share of wallet as a percent of overall consumer spending given sustained home price recovery and continued job and income gains in addition consumer balance sheets are strong as debt service ratios are near record lows and access to credit is gradually improving along with stronger incomes and rising home prices we believe stronger household financial conditions will support discretionary home improvement spending these macro factors should continue to contribute to household formation which will sustain home buying and related spending as homeowners upgrade and refresh their homes

nongaap financial measures 

return on invested capital 

return on invested capital roic is a nongaap financial measure we believe roic is a meaningful metric for investors because it represents management’s measure of how effectively the company is using capital to generate profits 

we define roic as trailing four quarters’ net operating profit after tax divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters although roic is a common financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating roic accordingly the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roic we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roic before comparing its roic to ours 

we consider return on average debt and equity to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to roic the difference between these two measures is that roic adjusts net earnings to exclude tax adjusted interest expense 

the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation to the calculation of return on average debt and equity the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows 



 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

to provide additional transparency the company has presented nongaap financial measures of adjusted diluted earnings per share to exclude the impact of certain discrete items not contemplated in lowe’s 2016 and 2015 business outlooks the company believes this nongaap financial measure provides useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating what management considers the company’s core financial performance 

adjusted diluted earnings per share should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful indicator of the company’s diluted earnings per common share as prepared in accordance with gaap the company’s methods of determining this nongaap financial measure may differ from the method used by other companies for this or similar nongaap financial measures accordingly these nongaap measures may not be comparable to the measures used by other companies 



 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015 

for the purpose of the following discussion comparable store sales comparable store average ticket and comparable store customer transactions are based upon comparable 53week periods 

net sales –  net sales increased 101 to 650 billion in 2016 the increase in total sales was driven by an increase in comparable sales the addition of rona the 53 rd  week and new stores the addition of rona and the 53 rd week contributed 38 and 16 respectively to the sales growth for 2016 the comparable sales increase of 42 in 2016 was driven by a 25 increase in comparable average ticket and a 16 increase in comparable customer transactions comparable sales during each quarter of the fiscal year as reported were 73 in the first quarter 20 in the second quarter 27 in the third quarter and 51 in the fourth quarter 

all of our product categories experienced comparable sales increases for the year during 2016 we experienced comparable sales increases above the company average in lumber  building materials appliances tools  hardware and lawn  garden performance in lumber  building materials and tools  hardware was driven by strong demand from the pro customer tools  hardware also benefited from customers’ positive response to our continued enhancements in product assortment and brand relevance strong brand and service advantages in appliances as well as our continued investment in customer experience both instore and online drove solid comparable sales during the year an extended outdoor selling season as a result of favorable weather conditions positively impacted sales within lawn  garden geographically all of our 14 us regions experienced increases in comparable store sales with the strongest results in the south and northwest 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 we experienced comparable sales increases in 12 of 13 product categories with comparable sales increases above the company average in appliances lawn  garden kitchens lumber  building materials and rough plumbing  electrical we experienced low singledigit negative comparable sales in outdoor power equipment strong brand and service advantages in appliances as well as our successful holiday events drove solid comparable sales during the quarter performance in kitchens was driven by our strategy to focus on the entire kitchen project investment in project specialists and targeted promotions we experienced strength in several outdoor project categories including lawn  garden lumber  building materials and rough plumbing  electrical warmer weather particularly in the south and west drove strong demand for outdoor projects in lawn  garden lumber  building materials benefited from continued recovery efforts from hurricane matthew and louisiana flooding as well as strong performance with the pro customer performance in outdoor power equipment was primarily driven by strong performance of winterweather related products 

such as snow throwers and generators in the prior year due to a significant winter storm in the northeast during the fourth quarter 

gross margin  – gross margin of 3455 for 2016 represented a 27 basis point decrease from 2015 the change was primarily driven by 23 basis points decrease due to purchase price adjustments to rona’s opening inventory balance and 11 basis points decrease due to targeted promotional activity partially offset by 9 basis points increase due to cost reductions associated with value improvement efforts 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 gross margin of 3441 decreased 25 basis points as a percentage of sales gross margin was negatively impacted 25 basis points by the rona business primarily driven by purchase price adjustments to their opening inventory balance and mix of business 

sga  – sga expense for 2016 leveraged 61 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2015 this was primarily driven by 45 basis points of net leverage associated with impairment charges recorded during 2016 versus 2015 relating to our australian joint venture with woolworths we experienced 15 basis points of leverage associated with incentive compensation 14 basis points in employee insurance costs and 12 basis points related to the settlement of the foreign currency option contract entered into in anticipation of the rona acquisition this was partially offset by 15 basis points of deleverage associated with the writeoff of cancelled technologyenabled projects as part of an ongoing review of our strategic initiatives and 12 basis points associated with severance and related costs for organizational changes in the stores distribution centers and corporate offices 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 sga expense leveraged 445 basis points as a percentage of sales due primarily to 403 basis points of leverage associated with a noncash impairment charge resulting from our decision to exit our australian joint venture recorded in the fourth quarter of the prior year we experienced 59 basis points of leverage in benefits primarily related to incentive compensation due to lower attainment levels compared to the same quarter of the prior year these were partially offset by 53 basis points of deleverage associated with separation events for organizational changes in the stores distribution centers and corporate offices store environment operating salaries and certain other costs also leveraged as a result of sales growth 

depreciation and amortization  – depreciation and amortization expense leveraged 24 basis points for 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the increase in sales from the 53rd week partially offset by incremental expense due to the acquisition of rona property less accumulated depreciation increased to 199 billion  at february 3 2017  compared to 196 billion  at january 29 2016  as of february 3 2017  and january 29 2016  we owned 79  and 86 of our stores respectively which included stores on leased land 

interest – net  – net interest expense is comprised of the following 



net interest expense increased due primarily to an increase in total debt compared to the prior year 

income tax provision   our effective income tax rate was 405 in 2016 compared to 424 in 2015 during 2016 the company was impacted by the passage of the us internal revenue service internal revenue code section 987 which negatively impacted the income tax rate due to the adjustment of deferred tax assets associated with   cumulative currency translation adjustments related to certain of the company’s international operations in addition the company recorded a deferred tax asset related to the investment in the australian joint venture with woolworths associated with the noncash impairment charges that occurred during both 2016 and 2015 the deferred tax asset associated with these losses was offset with the establishment of a full valuation allowance due to the fact the benefit of these losses can only be realized to the extent the company has available capital gains for offset and no present or future capital gains have been identified through which this deferred tax asset can be realized 

our effective income tax rates were 403 and 961 for the three months ended february 3 2017 and january 29 2016 respectively due to the same factors that impacted the income tax provision in the year 

fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014 

net sales – net sales increased 51 to 591 billion in 2015 the increase in total sales was driven primarily by the comparable sales increase of 48 and new stores the comparable sales increase of 48 in 2015 was driven by a 25 increase in comparable average ticket and a 22 increase in comparable customer transactions comparable sales during each quarter of the fiscal year as reported were 52 in the first quarter 43 in the second quarter 46 in the third quarter and 52 in the fourth quarter 

all of our product categories experienced comparable sales increases for the year during 2015 comparable sales were above the company average in the following product categories appliances outdoor power equipment and seasonal living appliances experienced the strongest growth with a double digit increase in comparable sales as we further strengthened our brand offerings and breadth of assortment and continued to provide service advantages with nextday delivery and haul away within outdoor power equipment we drove strong performance in walk behind and riding mowers as well as pressure washers the outdoor living experience introduced last year drove comparable sales in our seasonal living category where we continued to see strong sales in patio furniture replacement cushions and outdoor accessories in addition tools  hardware performed at approximately the overall company average driven by strong demand and continued improvement in both product assortment and brand relevance geographically all of our 14 us regions experienced increases in comparable store sales as sales performance was well balanced across the country 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded comparable sales increases above the company average in lumber  building materials appliances lawn  garden and paint we saw particular strength in outdoor project categories led by lumber  building materials and lawn  garden as customers took advantage of mild weather to complete exterior projects such as roofs fences decks and lawn care our landscape lighting experience also drove strong performance by providing inspiration and easy selection and installation for customers while offering new product technologies such as led we achieved strong comparable sales increases in appliances during the quarter through strengthened brand offerings and service advantages paint benefited from increased project activity as well as growing awareness of our threebrand offering providing customers with a full suite of top brands they can trust for their next paint project 

gross margin  – gross margin of 3482 for 2015 represented a three basis point increase from 2014 and was primarily driven by cost reductions associated with value improvement efforts and product cost deflation partially offset by negative impacts from targeted promotional activity and mix of products sold 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 gross margin of 3466 was flat as a percentage of sales due to the same factors that impacted gross margin in the year 

sga  – sga expense for 2015 deleveraged 28 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2014 this was primarily driven by 90 basis points of deleverage associated with an impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the valuation of our onethird interest in the australian joint venture with woolworths limited this was partially offset by 16 basis points of leverage associated with operating salaries as we optimized payroll hours against customer traffic and 16 basis points of leverage in advertising expense due to more efficient and effective media mix compared to the prior year we experienced eight basis points of leverage in employee insurance costs due to increased sales in the current year partially offset by additional costs associated with the affordable care act we also experienced eight basis points of leverage in utilities due to stronger sales as well as a decrease in rates and consumption in addition we experienced seven basis points of leverage in building and site repair due to a decrease in the number of repairs during the year and seven basis points of leverage in external labor due to completed projects and increased focus on use of internal resources across information technology projects 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 sga expense deleveraged 331 basis points as a percentage of sales due primarily to 401 basis points of deleverage associated with the australian joint venture impairment charge partially offset by leverage in operating salaries advertising expense utilities employee insurance and certain other fixed costs we experienced 25 basis points of leverage in operating salaries associated with optimization of store payroll hours and 20 basis points in advertising expense due to more efficient and effective media mix we also experienced 12 basis points of leverage in utilities primarily the result of warmer weather and 12 basis points in employee insurance costs due to a reduction in the number and severity of claims certain other fixed costs also leveraged as a result of sales growth 

depreciation and amortization  – depreciation and amortization expense leveraged 13 basis points for 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to the increase in sales property less accumulated depreciation decreased to 196 billion  at january 29 2016  compared to 200 billion at january 30 2015  at january 29 2016  and january 30 2015  we owned 86 of our stores which included stores on leased land 

interest – net  – net interest expense is comprised of the following 



net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of 175 billion and 125 billion of unsecured notes in september 2015 and 2014 respectively this was partially offset by the repayment of 500 million unsecured notes on october 15 2015 

income tax provision  – our effective income tax rate was 424 in 2015 compared to 369 in 2014 during 2015 the company recorded a deferred tax asset related to losses associated with the joint venture investment in australia with woolworths limited the deferred tax asset associated with these losses was offset with the establishment of a full valuation allowance due to the fact the benefit of these losses can only be realized to the extent the company has available capital gains for offset and no present or future capital gains have been identified through which this deferred tax asset can be realized the effective tax rate in 2014 benefited from the favorable settlement of certain federal tax matters 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for each of the three most recent fiscal years ended february 3 2017  



cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 versus 2015 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings adjusted for noncash expenses and improved working capital management the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 versus 2014 was primarily driven by changes in working capital 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities for 2016 versus 2015 was primarily driven by the acquisition of rona the increase in net cash used in investing activities for 2015 versus 2014 was primarily driven by increased capital expenditures and purchases of investments net of sales and maturities partially offset by decreased contributions to equity method investments 

the decrease in net cash used in financing activities for 2016 versus 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt the company received proceeds of 33 billion from the issuance of unsecured notes in 2016 compared to 17 billion in 2015 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities is also attributable to a decrease in share repurchases and is partially offset by an increase in repayments of longterm debt the decrease in net cash used in financing activities for 2015 versus 2014 was driven primarily by increased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt in 2015 and net repayments of shortterm borrowings in 2014 versus net borrowings in 2015 this was partially offset by increased repayments of longterm debt and increased cash dividend payments in 2015 

sources of liquidity 

liquidity is provided primarily by our cash flows from operations shortterm borrowing facilities and longterm debt 

in november 2016 the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the amended facility with a syndicate of banks to modify the company’s credit agreement dated august 29 2014 the 2014 credit facility which provided for borrowings up to 175 billion through august 2019 the amended facility extends the maturity date to 

november 2021 and continues to provide for borrowings up to 175 billion subject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the amended facility the company may increase the aggregate availability by an additional 500 million the amended facility supports our commercial paper program and has a 500 million  letter of credit sublimit letters of credit issued pursuant to the facility reduce the amount available for borrowing under its terms borrowings made are unsecured and priced at fixed rates based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the facility the amended facility contains customary representations warranties and covenants for a transaction of this type we were in compliance with those covenants at february 3 2017  as of february 3 2017  there were 510 million  of outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program and no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the credit facility 

we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both shortterm and longterm bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new longterm debt the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected however by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard  poor’s sp and moody’s as of april 3 2017  which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds although we currently do not expect a downgrade in our debt ratings our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 



we believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate not only for our operating requirements but also for investments in our existing stores and distribution facilities investments in information technology expansion plans acquisitions if any and to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases over the next 12 months there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price in addition we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate significant cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations 

cash requirements 

capital expenditures 

our fiscal 2017  capital forecast is approximately 14 billion investments in our existing stores including investments in remerchandising store equipment and technology are expected to account for approximately 40 of net cash outflow our expansion plans are expected to account for approximately 35 of planned net cash outflow approximately 20 of planned net cash outflow is for corporate programs including investments to enhance the customer experience as well as enhancements to the corporate infrastructure other planned capital expenditures accounting for approximately 5 of planned net cash outflow are for investments in our existing distribution network 

debt and capital 

unsecured debt of 500 million and 250 million is scheduled to mature in april 2017 and september 2017 respectively see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding longterm debt including fiscal year 2016  financing activities 

we have an ongoing share repurchase program authorized by the company’s board of directors that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private offmarket transactions shares purchased under the share repurchase program are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status as of february 3 2017  we had 51 billion  share repurchases remaining available under our program with no expiration date in fiscal 2017  we expect to repurchase shares totaling 35 billion  through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off market transactions in accordance with sec regulations see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding share repurchases 

dividends declared during fiscal 2016  totaled 12 billion our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of 2016  was paid in fiscal 2017  and totaled 304 million 

  

our ratio of debt to equity plus debt was 708 and 623 as of february 3 2017  and january 29 2016  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at february 3 2017  



 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory 

description 

we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels sales trends and historical experience during 2016  our reserve increased approximately 14 million to 59 million  as of february 3 2017  

we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories during 2016  the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately 18 million to 189 million  as of february 3 2017  

in addition we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business principally as a result of purchase volumes sales early payments or promotions of vendors’ products generally these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor’s product therefore we treat these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors’ products are recorded as an offset to the related expense 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions however changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves likewise changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and results of physical inventories we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value 

for vendor funds we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves however it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves a 10 change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 3 million for 2016  a 10 change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 12 million for 2016  

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective longterm estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 

impairment of investments 

description 

we use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over operating and financial policies of the investee our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings we use the cost method to account for investments in companies for which we do not exercise significant influence each of the company’s equity method and cost method investments are subject to a review for impairment if and when circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment could be less than the carrying value evidence considered in this evaluation includes but would not necessarily be limited to the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee recent operating trends and forecasted performance of the investee market conditions in the geographic area or industry in which the investee operates and the company’s strategic plans for holding the investment in relation to the period of time expected for an anticipated recovery of its carrying value if 

the results of our review indicate an other than temporary decline in the carrying value of our investment the company would write down the investment to its estimated fair value 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations for equity method and cost method investments require us to apply judgment in determining whether a decrease in value that is other than temporary has occurred if we need to assess the recoverability of our investments we will make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows of those investments these calculations require us to apply judgments including assumptions of future performance based on business plans and forecasts recent economic and business trends and competitive conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we own a onethird share in hydrox holdings pty ltd a joint venture with woolworths limited woolworths which operates masters home improvement stores and home timber and hardware group’s retail stores and wholesale distribution in australia as a result of our decision to exit the investment in 2015 woolworths is required to purchase lowe’s onethird share of the joint venture at fair value as of january 18 2016 the date of our notification of our intention to exit the process for the two parties agreeing on fair value is prescribed in the joint venture agreement 

during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 woolworths claimed a unilateral termination of the joint venture agreement and executed other agreements to initiate the wind down of hydrox without the company’s approval as required under the joint venture agreement due to this lowe’s has concluded that under applicable accounting standards the investment should be accounted for as a cost method investment going forward as a result of this determination accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments of 208 million were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the carrying value of the cost method investment in addition the unilateral actions of woolworths to begin the liquidation of hydrox represented a triggering event requiring the company to evaluate the cost method investment for impairment management determined that the requirements for determining impairment were met and leveraged wind down cash flow projections in determining the estimated fair value of the entity the value was determined using an income approach based upon the expected future cash flows generated from the settlement of assets and liabilities inclusive of inventory property payables lease liabilities and employee entitlements as a result the company recorded a 290 million noncash impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 to reflect its estimated portion of the overall joint venture fair value in wind down the assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination include the projected future cash anticipated in the settlement of assets and liabilities by woolworths further changes in this estimate are possible as the parties proceed through the final stages of the valuation process as defined in the joint venture agreement the carrying value of the investment as of february 3 2017 is 103 million a 10 change in our current estimate of fair value of the joint venture would have affected net earnings by approximately 10 million for 2016 

longlived asset impairment 

description 

we review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable when evaluating locations for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead 

we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to longlived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location’s asset carrying values may not be recoverable for operating locations our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a 12month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment including individual locations’ execution of their operating plans and local market conditions including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe’s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location’s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location management makes assumptions incorporating local market conditions about key store variables including sales growth rates gross margin and controllable expenses such as store payroll and occupancy expense as well as asset residual values or lease rates an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 

we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations which requires discounting projected future cash flows this involves making assumptions regarding both a location’s future cash flows as described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations for longlived assets require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows including estimated sales margin and controllable expenses assumptions about market performance for operating locations and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during 2016  14  operating locations experienced a triggering event and were evaluated for recoverability eleven  of the 14 operating locations were determined to be impaired due to a decline in recent cash flow trends and an unfavorable sales outlook resulting in an impairment loss of 34 million  during 2016  compared to impairment losses of 8 million related to two operating locations impaired during 2015  three of the 14 operating locations that experienced a triggering event during 2016 were determined to be recoverable and therefore were not impaired a 10 reduction in projected sales used to estimate future cash flows for these operating locations would not have had a significant impact to impairment losses recognized during 2016 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values our actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment losses 

goodwill 

description 

goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at least annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below the operating segment level the evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary if after assessing qualitative factors we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount then the twostep goodwill impairment test is necessary 

the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill fair value represents the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on discounted future cash flows if the fair value exceeds carrying value then no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss the second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination then the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including store growth rates existing store sales growth rates forecasting expenses and selecting appropriate discount rates 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 we determined our orchard supply hardware orchard reporting unit was impaired we recorded impairment loss related to the orchard reporting unit of 46 million which represented the entire amount of goodwill allocated to this reporting unit 

the carrying value of goodwill as of february 3 2017 was 11 billion  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

selfinsurance 

description 

we are selfinsured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation automobile general and product liability extended protection plan and certain medical and dental claims our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable is limited to 2 million per occurrence involving workers’ compensation 5 million per occurrence involving general or product liability and 10 million per occurrence involving automobile we do not have any insurance coverage for selfinsured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims selfinsurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for selfinsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during 2016  our selfinsurance liability decreased approximately 52 million to 831 million  as of february 3 2017  

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposures including payroll sales and vehicle units as well as the frequency lag and severity of claims 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded selfinsurance liabilities a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 51 million for 2016  a 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately 17 million for 2016  

revenue recognition 

description 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the effects of future events that cannot be determined with certainty 

we sell separatelypriced extended protection plan contracts under a lowe’sbranded program for which the company is ultimately selfinsured the company recognizes revenues from extended protection plan sales on a straightline basis over the respective contract term extended protection plan contract terms primarily range from one to four years from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer’s warranty as applicable the company consistently groups and evaluates extended protection plan contracts based on the characteristics of the underlying products and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected losses a loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected costs of performing services under the contracts exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition costs and related deferred revenue associated with the contracts   deferred revenues associated with the extended protection plan contracts increased 34 million to 763 million  as of february 3 2017  

we defer revenue and cost of sales associated with settled transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed revenue is deferred based on the actual amounts received we use historical gross margin rates to estimate the adjustment to cost of sales for these transactions during 2016  deferred revenues associated with these transactions increased 136 million to 755 million as of february 3 2017  

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

for extended protection plans there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected losses as a result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contracts and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contracts there is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of costs of performing services under these contracts 

for the deferral of revenue and cost of sales associated with transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed there is judgment inherent in our estimates of gross margin rates 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contracts during the past three fiscal years we currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract losses on our extended protection plan contracts although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected losses under the extended protection plan contracts it is possible that actual results could differ from our estimates in addition if future evidence indicates that the costs of performing services under these contracts are incurred on other than a straightline basis the timing of revenue recognition under these contracts could change a 10 change in the amount of revenue recognized in 2016  under these contracts would have affected net earnings by approximately 22 million 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to reverse net sales and cost of sales related to amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates related to the impact to cost of sales for these transactions however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may incur additional income or expense a 10 change in the estimate of the gross margin rates applied to these transactions would have affected net earnings by approximately 11 million in 2016  

disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements 

we speak throughout this annual report in forwardlooking statements about our future but particularly in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the words “believe” “expect” “will” “should” “suggest” and other similar expressions are intended to identify those forwardlooking statements while we believe our expectations are reasonable they are not guarantees of future performance our actual results could differ substantially from our expectations 

for a detailed description of the risks and uncertainties that we are exposed to you should read the “risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report all forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report or in the case of any document incorporated by reference the date of that document all subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section and in the “risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forwardlooking statements to reflect events circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and consists primarily of fixedrate instruments therefore providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instruments 

commodity price risk 

we purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control we believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices the selling prices of these commodity products are influenced in part by the market price we pay which is determined by industry supply and demand 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

historically our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our international operations into us dollars has not been material to our financial condition and results of operations we will be further exposed to this risk as we increase operations in canada following the acquisition of rona to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk on the consideration to be paid for the rona acquisition the company entered into a foreign currency exchange option during 

the first quarter of fiscal 2016 to purchase 32 billion canadian dollars at a strike price of 13933 in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 the option contract was settled the net gain of 76 million was included in the accompanying consolidated statements of current and retained earnings 




 item 9  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a  controls and procedures 

the company’s management with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rule 13a15e promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act based upon their evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the company files or submits under the exchange act with the securities and exchange commission the sec 1 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and 2 is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act and the report of deloitte  touche llp the company’s independent registered public accounting firm are included in item 8 of this annual report 

in addition no change in the company’s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal fourth quarter ended february 3 2017  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

customers market and competition 

our customers 

we serve homeowners renters and professional customers pro customers retail customers comprised of individual homeowners and renters complete a wide array of projects and vary along the spectrum of doityourself diy and doitforme difm the pro customer consists of two broad categories construction trades and maintenance repair  operations 

our market 

  

we are among the many businesses including home centers paint stores hardware stores lumber yards and garden centers whose revenues are included in the building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers subsector 444 of the retail trade sector of the north american industry classification system naics the standard used by federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting analyzing and publishing statistical data related to the us business economy the total annual revenue reported for businesses included in naics 444 in 2015 was 3321 billion which represented an increase of 42 over the amount reported for the same category in 2014 the total annual revenue reported for businesses included in naics 444 in 2014 was 3187 billion which represented an increase of 55 over the amount reported for the same category in 2013 these figures are subject to periodic revision by the us department of commerce 

naics 444 represents less than half of what we consider the total market for our products and services the broader market in which lowe’s operates includes homerelated sales through a variety of companies beyond those in naics 444 these consist of other companies in the retail sector including mass retailers home furnishings stores and online retailers as well as wholesalers that provide homerelated products and services to homeowners businesses and the government based on our analysis of the most recent comprehensive data available we estimate the size of the us home improvement market at 735 billion in 2015 comprised of 548 billion of product sales and 187 billion of installed labor sales that compares with 688 billion total market sales in 2014 comprised of 511 billion of product sales and 177 billion of installed labor sales these figures are subject to periodic revision by the us department of commerce and other thirdparty sources 

  

there are many variables that affect consumer demand for the home improvement products and services lowe’s offers key indicators we monitor include real disposable personal income employment home prices and housing turnover we also monitor demographic and societal trends that shape home improvement industry growth 

  

 

blue chip economic indicators ® issn 01934600 is published monthly by aspen publishers 76 ninth avenue new york ny 10011 a division of wolters kluwer law and business printed in the usa 

 

 

 

these indicators are important to our business because they signal a customer’s willingness to engage in home maintenance repair and upgrade projects and favorably impact income available to purchase our products and services overall the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive for 2016 the lagged benefit of stronger home buying and continued home price appreciation should drive home improvement spending in 2016 offsetting moderation in job growth and the ongoing potential pressure on mortgage rates 

our competition 

the home improvement industry includes a broad competitive landscape we compete with other home improvement warehouse chains and lumberyards in most of our trade areas we also compete with traditional hardware plumbing electrical and home supply retailers in addition we compete with general merchandise retailers warehouse clubs and online and other specialty retailers as well as service providers that install home improvement products location of stores continues to be a key competitive factor in our industry however the increasing use of technology and the simplicity of online shopping also underscore the importance of omnichannel capabilities as a competitive factor we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing better customer experiences while delivering superior value in products and service see further discussion of competition in item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k

supply chain 

we source our products from over 7500 vendors worldwide with no single vendor accounting for more than 6 of total purchases we believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all of our products whenever possible we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for customers and improve our gross margin 

to efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain instock levels we own and operate distribution facilities that enable products to be received from vendors stored and picked or crossdocked and then shipped to our retail locations or directly to customers these facilities include 15 highlyautomated regional distribution centers rdc in the united states on average each domestic rdc serves approximately 115 stores we also own and operate a distribution facility to serve our canadian stores and lease and operate a distribution facility to serve our orchard stores additionally we have a service agreement with a third party logistics provider to manage a distribution facility to serve our stores in mexico

selling channels 

we are continuing our progress towards becoming an omnichannel retail company which allows our customers to move from channel to channel with simple and seamless transitions even within the same transaction for example for many projects more than half of our customers conduct research online before making an instore purchase for purchases made on lowescom approximately 60 are picked up instore 10 are delivered from a store and 30 are parcel shipped regardless of the channels through which customers choose to engage with us we strive to provide them with a seamless experience across channels and an endless aisle of products enabled by our flexible fulfillment capabilities our ability to sell products instore online onsite or through our contact centers speaks to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure with the omnichannel capabilities we continue to introduce

seasonality and working capital 

the retail business in general is subject to seasonal influences and our business is to some extent seasonal historically we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter may june and july and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter november december and january accordingly our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes we fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations but also with shortterm borrowings as needed for more detailed information see the financial condition liquidity and capital resources section in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a  risk factors 

we have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys external research planning processes risk mapping analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational financial environmental reputational strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business for more information about our risk management framework which is administered by our chief risk officer and includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify see the description included in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders as defined in item 10 of part iii of this annual report on form 10k under “board’s role in the risk management process” 

we describe below certain risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition business reputation or business prospects these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended supplemented or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in our future periodic reports on form 10k form 10q and reports on other forms we file with the securities and exchange commission all forwardlooking statements about our future results of operations or other matters made by us in this annual report on form 10k in our annual report to lowe’s shareholders and in our subsequently filed reports to the securities and exchange commission as well as in our press releases and other public communications are qualified by the risks described below 

you should read these risk factors in conjunction with managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

we may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly changing retailing environment to address the changing shopping habits demands and demographics of our customers 

the home improvement retailing environment like the retailing environment generally is rapidly evolving and adapting our business concept to respond to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and their changing demographics is critical to our future success our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to the economic social style and other trends that affect demographic and consumer preferences in a variety of our merchandise categories and service offerings customers’ expectations about how they wish to research purchase and receive products and services have also evolved it is 

difficult to predict the mix of products and services that our customers will demand failure to identify such trends and adapt our business concept successfully could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for the home improvement products and services we sell the rate of growth of our business and our market share 

we may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on omnichannel sales and marketing presence if we fail to deliver the capabilities required to execute on them 

our interactions with customers has evolved into an omnichannel experience as they increasingly are using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business omnichannel retailing is quickly evolving and we must anticipate and meet our customer expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors our customerfacing technology systems must appeal to our customers function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience the success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and changing demographics will require us to deliver large complex programs requiring more integrated planning initiative prioritization and program sequencing these initiatives will require new competencies in many positions and our management employees and contractors will have to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access our results of operations financial condition or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we fail to provide a consistent experience for our customers regardless of sales channel if our technology systems do not meet our customers’ expectations if we are unable to counteract new developments and innovations implemented by our competitors or if we are unable to attract and retain additional personnel at various levels of the company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic initiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly changing retailing environment 

our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer employee vendor or company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems assets and such information from the threat of cyberattacks 

cyberattacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving and high profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major us companies including several large retailers despite widespread recognition of the cyberattack threat and improved data protection methods as with many other retailers we receive and store certain personal information about our customers employees and vendors additionally we use thirdparty service providers for services such as authentication content delivery backoffice support and other functions despite our continued vigilance and investment in information security we or our thirdparty service providers may be unable to adequately anticipate or prevent a breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized release of sensitive data should this occur it may have a material adverse effect on our reputation drive customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions or potential liability including possible punitive damages a security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of sensitive data from our or our thirdparty service providers’ information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks in addition as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other companies obligation to protect such sensitive data becomes stricter a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts our private label and cobranded credit cards gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing and physical bank checks and we may offer different payment options over time these payment options subject us to many compliance requirements including but not limited to compliance with payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements rules governing electronic funds transfers and payment card industry data security standards they also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks gift cards and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omnichannel sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

access to the internet from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them our websites including lowescom and lowesforproscom is a sales channel for our products and is also a method of making product project and other relevant information available to them that impacts our instore sales additionally we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire inform crosssell establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service or other cyberattacks or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of lowe’s as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services 

if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists with expanded skill sets or corporate support staff with the capabilities of delivering on strategic objectives we could lose sales to our competitors and our labor costs resulting from operations or the execution of corporate strategies could be negatively affected 

our customers whether they are homeowners renters or commercial businesses expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide we compete with other retailers for many of our sales associates and specialists and we invest significantly in them with respect to training and development to strive for high engagement increasingly our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets including in some instances the ability to do inhome or telephone sales a critical challenge we face is attracting and retaining a sufficiently diverse workforce that can deliver relevant culturally competent and differentiated experience for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers in fact many of our stores our employees must be able to serve customers whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own additionally in order to deliver on the omnichannel expectations of customers we rely on the specialized training and capabilities of corporate support staff which are broadly sought after by our competitors if we are unable to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our results of operations could be negatively affected furthermore our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to a variety of external factors including wage rates the availability of and competition for talent health care and other benefit costs our brand image and reputation changing demographics and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations periodically we are subject to labor organizing efforts and if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect how we operate our business and adversely affect our labor costs and our ability to retain a qualified workforce 

positively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is critical to our business success and if our public image and reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers vendors and store associates and specialists and consequently our business and results of operations 

our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at lowe’s our vendors want to do business with lowe’s and our sales associates and specialists want to work for lowe’s we must continue to manage preserve and grow lowe’s public image and reputation any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence reduce demand for our products and services affect our relationships with current and future vendors impact our results of operations and affect our ability to retain and recruit store associates and specialists the significant expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents 

strategic transactions including our pending acquisition of rona inc rona involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous uncertainties and risks 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions joint ventures investments and other growth market and geographic expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales cost savings synergies and other various benefits as discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview  looking forward” of this annual report on form 10k in early 2016 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire rona our ability to deliver the expected benefits from any strategic transactions is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks including our ability to integrate personnel labor models financial it and other systems successfully disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management hiring additional management and other critical personnel and increasing the scope geographic diversity and complexity of our operations effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations additionally any 

impairment   of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any strategic transaction may materially reduce our earnings   our shareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions and if we do not realize any anticipated benefits from such transactions we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business or joint venture and we may be exposed to litigation in connection with the strategic transaction further we may finance these strategic transactions by incurring additional debt which could increase leverage or impact our ability to access capital in the future 

our pending acquisition of rona may not close when we expect or at all 

the consummation of our pending transaction to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares and preferred shares of rona is subject to rona common shareholder approval and satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals if these conditions are not satisfied or waived the acquisition will not be consummated there can be no assurance that we will complete the acquisition on the time frame that we anticipate or under the terms set forth in the arrangement agreement or at all failure to complete the acquisition of rona or any delays in completing the acquisition could have an adverse impact on our future business and operations in addition we will have incurred significant acquisitionrelated expenses without realizing the expected benefits 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales profitability cash flows and financial condition 

product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe’s and the company’s brand image if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal financial and reputation risks actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement action and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities as a result lowe’s reputation as a retailer of high quality products and services including both national and lowe’s private brands could suffer and impact customer loyalty 

we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively or if they develop a substantially more effective or lower cost means of meeting customer needs resulting in a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the principal competitive factors in our industry include convenience customer service quality and price of merchandise and services instock levels and merchandise assortment and presentation we face growing competition from online and multichannel retailers who have a similar product or service offering customers are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine realtime product availability or price using digital tools our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our results 

our inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our business plan and financial results 

we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national and international brand names we also have relationships with certain suppliers to enable us to sell proprietary products which differentiate us from other retailers the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain these relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business operation and financial results 

failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

no single vendor of the products we sell accounts for more than 6 of our total purchases but we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business many of these vendors and service providers have certain products or specialized skills needed to support our business concept and our strategies if these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or are unable to perform as expected or if we fail to manage them properly and we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to replace them and potentially in some cases permanently 

if our domestic or international supply chain or our fulfillment network for our products is disrupted for any reason our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted 

we source stock and sell products from over 7000 domestic and international vendors and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success we source a large number of those products from foreign 

manufacturers with china continuing to be the dominant import source financial instability among key vendors political instability and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain changes in the costs of commodities in our supply chains fuel labor and currency exchange rates port labor disputes weatherrelated events natural disasters work stoppages shipping capacity restrains retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the united states or a major source country tariffs currency exchange rates and transport availability capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs additionally as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements our network becomes increasingly complex if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments then we will experience delay in inventory increased delivery costs merchandise outofstocks which would negatively affect our results of operations 

failure to effectively manage our third party installers could result in increased operational and legal risks and negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we use third party installers to provide installation services to our customers and as the general contractor we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors including the management of the permitting licensing and quality of our third party installers our failure to effectively manage such requirements the third party installers and our internal processes regarding installation services could result in lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could negatively affect our business 

operating internationally presents unique challenges including some that have required us to adapt our store operations merchandising marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada and mexico our business and results of operations could be negatively affected if we are unable to effectively address these challenges 

we expect a significant portion of our anticipated store growth over the next five years will be in canada and mexico expanding internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks and slow the anticipated rate of such expansion our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions in which we currently operate or may operate in the future could be negatively affected by a variety of factors including unfavorable political or economic factors adverse tax consequences volatility in foreign currency exchange rates increased difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights costs and difficulties of managing international operations challenges with identifying and contracting with local suppliers and other risks created as a result of differences in culture laws and regulations these factors could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 

we must comply with various and multiple laws and regulations that differ substantially in each area where we operate changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities or our inability to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

laws and regulations at the local regional state federal and international levels change frequently and the changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors if we fail to comply with these laws rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied we may be subject to government enforcement action litigation damage to our reputation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties and increased cost of regulatory compliance any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance these laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to import and export requirements us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws there can be no certainty that our employees and third parties with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or laws many of these laws are complex evolving and are subject to varying interpretations and enforcement actions any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies as a result of enforcing existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry country or practice 

future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements negatively affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are and in the future will become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or 

resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments additionally defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may require a diversion of management’s attention and resources none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved individually or collectively is considered material 

our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly improve and maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 

an important part of our efforts to provide an omnichannel experience for our customers we must invest in maintain and make ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as sales inventory replenishment merchandise ordering project design and execution transportation receipt processing and fulfillment our systems are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events power outages viruses malicious attacks telecommunications failures and we may incur significant expense data loss as well as a well in customer confidence additionally we continually make investments in our systems which may introduce disruption our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to maintain improve upgrade and expand our systems 

liquidity and access to capital rely on efficient rational and open capital markets and are dependent on lowe’s credit strength our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business financial performance and results of operations 

we have relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund working capital needs our access to these markets depends on our strong credit ratings the overall condition of debt capital markets and our operating performance disruption in the financial markets or an erosion of our credit strength or declines on our credit rating could impact negatively our ability to meet capital requirements or fund working capital needs 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales 

many us and global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of slow economic growth or recession volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of borrowing to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending high rates of unemployment consumer debt levels fluctuations in fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters and acts of both domestic and international terrorism sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects although the housing market has been strengthened by favorable interest rates and increasing home prices the large number of households that continue to have little available equity mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates that remain high tight restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing slow household formation growth rates and decreases in housing turnover through existing home sales have limited and may continue to limit consumers’ discretionary spending particularly on larger home improvement projects that are important to the growth of our business

executive overview 

net sales for 2015 were 591 billion a 51 increase over fiscal year 2014 comparable sales increased 48 driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 25 and a comparable transaction increase of 22 net earnings which were negatively impacted by an impairment charge discussed below declined 56 to 25 billion diluted earnings per common share increased to 273 from 271 in 2014 

results for 2015 were negatively impacted by a 530 million noncash impairment charge associated with our decision to exit the australian home improvement market by withdrawing from our joint venture with woolworths limited excluding the impact of this charge adjusted net income totaled 31 billion an increase of 140 over 2014 and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 214 to 329 see discussion on nongaap financial measures beginning on page 21 

for 2015 cash flows from operating activities were approximately 48 billion with 12 billion used for capital expenditures delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders the company repurchased 535 million shares of stock through the share repurchase program for 38 billion and paid 957 million in dividends during the year 

throughout 2015 we remained committed to our key priorities capitalizing on opportunities within an improving economy and further pursue top line growth through differentiating ourselves with better customer experiences improving our product and service offering for the pro customer and driving productivity and profitability in addition we continued to enhance our omnichannel capabilities providing not just the products but also the services information and advice to help our customers at every step of the home improvement journey and build a greater affinity for the lowe’s brand 

through collaboration between our merchants stores and customer experience design team we leveraged our customer experience design capabilities as well as our larger store format to showcase the outdoor living experience and the holiday décor experience which drove strong sales and attachment for products during the year to help customers envision and create their outdoor spaces for spring we displayed patio sets with coordinating rugs umbrellas and accessories along with grills and other outdoor products just as they would have expected in their own backyard this space was repurposed for the holiday décor experience in the second half of the year which inspired customers to decorate raised awareness of the breadth of holiday décor and gift offerings and provided project solutions relevant to the holiday micro seasons by providing an integrative and cohesive assortment of products inspiring and intuitive presentation and display and optimal service components across all selling channels we are able to provide better customer experiences that differentiate us in the marketplace 

we remained committed to building on our strong foundation with the pro customer by continuing to advance our product and service offerings to meet their unique needs throughout the year we have strengthened our portfolio of profocused brands with the addition of both national and local brands in addition our relaunch of lowesforproscom in the first half of the year provides the pro customer with an easy online ordering experience with their choice of instore pickup or delivery saving the pro time and money the site makes it easy for pros to manage multiple properties and easily purchase items for their locations 

nationwide we are also reconnecting with pro customers through targeted marketing as well as profocused events to drive awareness and generate new business 

in an effort to drive expense productivity during 2015 we effectively managed payroll hours on solid comparable sales growth and improved productivity in advertising through targeted spend we increased the efficiency and effectiveness of our marketing spend through optimized media allocation presence in targeted digital advertising expanded social media presence and reduced print advertising all while maintaining our customer reach and improving exposure in addition to payroll and marketing expenses we remain committed to identifying and implementing additional expense efficiencies by leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend which improves the flow through of sales dollars to operating profit

looking forward 

economic forecasts for 2016 suggest the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive continued support from steady job growth and improved household incomes as well as favorable trends in the housing market should keep home improvement growth buoyant despite recent volatility in the financial markets the fundamentals for continued growth in consumer spending remain intact consumers should continue to benefit from improved household financial conditions and lower gas prices on top of moderate job and income growth 

as we move into 2016 we continue to take a prudent approach to managing our portfolio of businesses making decisions that will shape how we better serve and connect with customers with the decision to exit the australian home improvement market during the fourth quarter of 2015 we will focus our resources on areas of the business where we see greater potential return on investment in early 2016 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire rona inc rona a major canadian retailer and distributor of hardware building materials and home renovation products this transaction is expected to accelerate lowe’s growth strategy by significantly expanding our presence in the canadian market through the addition of rona’s attractive business and store locations the transaction is subject to rona common shareholder approval and receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second half of 2016 

at the same time we are reinforcing our international business we will remain focused on growing sales by continuing to differentiate ourselves through better customer experiences that make us the project authority improving our product and service offering for the pro customer and enhancing our omnichannel capabilities to support customers at every step of their home improvement journey we will also focus on driving productivity and profitability through payroll and marketing optimization and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend this strategic framework along with our efforts to improve productivity and profitability give us confidence in our business outlook for 2016 

operations 

the following tables set forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings as well as the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements 





 

nongaap financial measures 

return on invested capital 

we believe return on invested capital roic is a meaningful metric for investors because it measures how effectively the company uses capital to generate profits 

we define roic as trailing four quarters’ net operating profit after tax divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters although roic is a common financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating roic accordingly the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roic we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roic before comparing its roic to ours 

we consider return on average debt and equity to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to roic the difference between these two measures is that roic adjusts net earnings to exclude tax adjusted interest expense 

the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation to the calculation of return on average debt and equity the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows 



 

adjusted net earnings adjusted ebit and adjusted diluted earnings per share 

we have disclosed nongaap adjusted net earnings adjusted ebit and adjusted diluted earnings per share which exclude the impact of the 530 million noncash impairment charge recognized during 2015 in connection with the company’s decision to exit its joint venture with woolworths limited in australia we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful insight for investors in evaluating what management considers the companys core financial performance these measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 

adjusted net earnings adjusted ebit and adjusted diluted earnings per share should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for net earnings and diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with gaap the company’s methods of determining these nongaap financial measures may differ from the methods used by other companies for these or similar nongaap financial measures accordingly these nongaap measures may not be comparable to the measures used by other companies 

the most comparable gaap measures are net earnings and diluted earnings per share the following provides a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings adjusted ebit and adjusted diluted earnings per share to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 



fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014   

net sales –  net sales increased 51 to 591 billion in 2015 the increase in total sales was driven primarily by the comparable sales increase of 48 and new stores the comparable sales increase of 48 in 2015 was driven by a 25 increase in comparable average ticket and a 22 increase in comparable customer transactions comparable sales during each quarter of the fiscal year as reported were 52 in the first quarter 43 in the second quarter 46 in the third quarter and 52 in the fourth quarter

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded comparable sales increases above the company average in lumber  building materials appliances lawn  garden and paint we saw particular strength in outdoor project categories led by lumber  building materials and lawn  garden as customers took advantage of mild weather to complete exterior projects such as roofs fences decks and lawn care our landscape lighting experience also drove strong performance by providing inspiration and easy selection and installation for customers while offering new product technologies such as led we achieved strong comparable sales increases in appliances during the quarter through strengthened brand offerings and service advantages paint benefited from increased project activity as well as growing awareness of our threebrand offering providing customers with a full suite of top brands they can trust for their next paint project 

gross margin  – gross margin of 3482 for 2015 represented a three basis point increase from 2014 and was primarily driven by cost reductions associated with value improvement and product cost deflation partially offset by negative impacts from targeted promotional activity and mix of products sold 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 gross margin of 3466 was flat as a percentage of sales due to the same factors that impacted gross margin in the year 

sga  – sga expense for 2015 deleveraged 28 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2014 this was primarily driven by 90 basis points of deleverage associated with an impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the valuation of our onethird interest in the australian joint venture with woolworths limited this was partially offset by 16 basis points of leverage associated with operating salaries as we optimized payroll hours against customer traffic and 16 

basis points of leverage in advertising expense due to more efficient and effective media mix compared to the prior year we experienced eight basis points of leverage in employee insurance costs due to increased sales in the current year partially offset by additional costs associated with the affordable care act we also experienced eight basis points of leverage in utilities due to stronger sales as well as a decrease in rates and consumption in addition we experienced seven basis points of leverage in building and site repair due to a decrease in the number of repairs during the year and seven basis points of leverage in external labor due to completed projects and increased focus on use of internal resources across information technology projects

income tax provision   our effective income tax rate was 424 in 2015 compared to 369 in 2014 during 2015 the company recorded a deferred tax asset related to losses associated with the joint venture investment in australia with woolworths limited    the deferred tax asset associated with these losses was offset with the establishment of a full valuation allowance due to the fact the benefit of these losses can only be realized to the extent the company has available capital gains for offset and no present or future capital gains have been identified through which this deferred tax asset can be realized excluding the equity losses and related deferred tax asset would have resulted in an effective income tax rate of 382 the effective tax rate in 2014 benefited from the favorable settlement of certain federal tax matters

in addition to our cash flows from operations liquidity is provided by our shortterm borrowing facilities we have a 175 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement the 2014 credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires in august 2019 subject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the 2014 credit facility we may increase the aggregate availability by an additional 500 million the 2014 credit facility supports our commercial paper program and has a 500 million letter of credit sublimit letters of credit issued pursuant to the facility reduce the amount available for borrowing under its terms borrowings made are unsecured and are priced at fixed rates based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the facility the 2014 credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants which include maintenance of an adjusted debt leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement we were in compliance with those covenants at january 29 2016  as of january 29 2016  there were 43 million  of outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program and no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the credit facility 

we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both shortterm and longterm bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new longterm debt the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected however by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard  poor’s sp and moody’s as of march 28 2016  which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds although we currently do not expect a downgrade in our debt ratings our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 



we believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate not only for our operating requirements but also for investments in our existing stores investments in information technology expansion plans 

acquisitions if any and to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases over the next 12 months there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price in addition we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations unrepatriated cash was not significant for all periods presented 

cash requirements 

capital expenditures 

our fiscal 2016  capital forecast is approximately 15 billion our expansion plans are expected to account for approximately 45 of planned net cash outflow investments in our existing stores including investments in remerchandising store equipment and technology are expected to account for approximately 30 of net cash outflow approximately 20 of planned net cash outflow is for corporate programs including investments to enhance the customer experience as well as enhancements to the corporate infrastructure other planned capital expenditures accounting for approximately 5 of planned net cash outflow are for investments in our existing distribution network 

on february 2 2016 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of rona for c24 per share in cash and preferred shares for c20 per share in cash for a total transaction price of approximately c32 billion the transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of lowe’s and rona and is supported by the management teams of both companies however the transaction is subject to both shareholder and regulatory approvals we anticipate financing the transaction through the debt capital markets in addition we have entered into an option to purchase canadian dollars at a strike price of 13933 expiring november 1 2016 the transaction is expected to close in fiscal year 2016

dividends declared during fiscal 2015  totaled 991 million our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of 2015  was paid in fiscal 2016  and totaled 255 million 

  

our ratio of debt to equity plus debt was 623 and 533 as of january 29 2016  and january 30 2015  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at january 29 2016  



 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this form 10k requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory 

description 

we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels sales trends and historical experience during 2015  our reserve decreased approximately 6 million to 46 million  as of january 29 2016  

we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories during 2015  the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately 9 million to 171 million  as of january 29 2016  

in addition we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business principally as a result of purchase volumes sales early payments or promotions of vendors’ products generally these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor’s product therefore we treat these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the 

inventory is sold funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors’ products are recorded as an offset to the related expense 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions however changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves likewise changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and results of physical inventories we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value 

for vendor funds we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves however it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves a 10 change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 2 million for 2015  a 10 change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 10 million for 2015  

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective longterm estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 

equity method investments 

description 

we use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over operating and financial policies of the investee our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings each of the company’s equity method investments is subject to a review for impairment if and when circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment could be less than the carrying value if the results of our review indicate an other than temporary decline in the carrying value of our investment the company would write down the investment to its estimated fair value 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations for equity method investments require us to apply judgment in determining whether a decrease in value that is other than temporary has occurred if we need to assess the recoverability of our equity method investments we will make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows of those investments these calculations require us to apply judgments including assumptions of future performance based on business plans and forecasts recent economic and business trends and competitive conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we made the decision to exit our australian joint venture investment with woolworths limited woolworths and recorded a 530 million impairment of our investment due to a determination that there was a decrease in value that was other than temporary we own a onethird share in the joint venture hydrox holdings pty ltd which operates masters home improvement stores and home timber and hardware group’s retail stores and wholesale distribution in australia as a result of our decision to exit woolworths will be required to purchase lowe’s onethird share in the joint venture at an agreed upon fair value as of january 18 2016 the date of our notification of our intention to exit the process for the two parties agreeing on fair value is prescribed in the joint venture agreement finalization of the purchase price for lowe’s interest in the joint venture and completion of the sale is expected to occur in 2016 the 530 million noncash impairment charge which includes the cumulative impact of the strengthening us dollar over the life of the investment 

was based on the company’s estimate of the value of its portion of the overall joint venture fair value this value was determined using an income approach based on expected discounted cash flows and was validated for reasonableness by comparison to similar transaction multiples the assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination include the continuation as a going concern projected revenues projected margin rates and the discount rate further changes in this estimate are possible as the parties proceed through the final stages of the valuation process as defined in the joint venture agreement a 10 change in our current estimate of fair value of the joint venture would have affected net earnings by approximately 39 million for 2015 

longlived asset impairment 

description 

we review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable when evaluating locations for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead 

we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to longlived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location’s asset carrying values may not be recoverable for operating locations our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a 12month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment including individual locations’ execution of their operating plans and local market conditions including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe’s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location’s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location management makes assumptions incorporating local market conditions about key store variables including sales growth rates gross margin and controllable expenses such as store payroll and occupancy expense as well as asset residual values or lease rates an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 

we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations which requires discounting projected future cash flows this involves making assumptions regarding both a location’s future cash flows as described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations for longlived assets require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows including estimated sales margin and controllable expenses assumptions about market performance for operating locations and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during 2015  two operating locations experienced a triggering event and both locations were determined to be impaired we recorded impairment losses related to these two operating locations of 8 million during 2015  compared to impairment losses of 26 million related to three operating locations impaired during 2014  

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values our actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment losses 

selfinsurance 

description 

we are selfinsured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation automobile general and product liability extended protection plan and certain medical and dental claims our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable is limited to 2 million per occurrence involving workers’ compensation 5 million per occurrence involving general or product liability and 10 million per occurrence involving automobile we do not have any insurance coverage for selfinsured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims selfinsurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for selfinsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during 2015  our selfinsurance liability decreased approximately 22 million to 883 million  as of january 29 2016  

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposures including payroll sales and vehicle units as well as the frequency lag and severity of claims 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded selfinsurance liabilities a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 54 million for 2015  a 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately 18 million for 2015  

revenue recognition 

description 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the effects of future events that cannot be determined with certainty 

we sell separatelypriced extended protection plan contracts under a lowe’sbranded program for which the company is ultimately selfinsured the company recognizes revenues from extended protection plan sales on a straightline basis over the respective contract term extended protection plan contract terms primarily range from one to four years from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer’s warranty as applicable the company consistently groups and evaluates extended protection plan contracts based on the characteristics of the underlying products and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected losses a loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected costs of performing services under the contracts exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition costs and related deferred revenue associated with the contracts   deferred revenues associated with the extended protection plan contracts decreased 1 million to 729 million  as of january 29 2016  

we defer revenue and cost of sales associated with settled transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed revenue is deferred based on the actual amounts received we use historical gross margin rates to estimate the adjustment to cost of sales for these transactions during 2015  deferred revenues associated with these transactions increased 74 million to 619 million as of january 29 2016  

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

for extended protection plans there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected losses as a result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contracts and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contracts there is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of costs of performing services under these contracts 

for the deferral of revenue and cost of sales associated with transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed there is judgment inherent in our estimates of gross margin rates 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contracts during the past three fiscal years we currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract losses on our extended protection plan contracts although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected losses 

under the extended protection plan contracts it is possible that actual results could differ from our estimates in addition if future evidence indicates that the costs of performing services under these contracts are incurred on other than a straightline basis the timing of revenue recognition under these contracts could change a 10 change in the amount of revenue recognized in 2015  under these contracts would have affected net earnings by approximately 22 million 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to reverse net sales and cost of sales related to amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates related to the impact to cost of sales for these transactions however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may incur additional income or expense a 10 change in the estimate of the gross margin rates applied to these transactions would have affected net earnings by approximately 10 million in 2015  

disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements 

we speak throughout this annual report on form 10k in forwardlooking statements about our future but particularly in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the words “believe” “expect” “will” “should” “suggest” and other similar expressions are intended to identify those forwardlooking statements while we believe our expectations are reasonable they are not guarantees of future performance our actual results could differ substantially from our expectations 

for a detailed description of the risks and uncertainties that we are exposed to you should read the “risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k to the united states securities and exchange commission all forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this report or in the case of any document incorporated by reference the date of that document all subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section and in the “risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forwardlooking statements to reflect events circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and consists primarily of fixedrate instruments therefore providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instruments 

commodity price risk 

we purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control we believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices the selling prices of these commodity products are influenced in part by the market price we pay which is determined by industry supply and demand 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition and results of operations

seasonality and working capital 

the retail business in general is subject to seasonal influences and our business is to some extent seasonal historically we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter may june and july and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter november december and january accordingly our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes we fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations but also with shortterm borrowings as needed for more detailed information see the financial condition liquidity and capital resources section in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a  risk factors 

we have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys external research planning processes risk mapping analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational financial environmental reputational strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business for more information about our risk management process which is administered by our chief risk officer and includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify see the description included in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders as defined in item 10 of part iii of this annual report on form 10k under “board’s role in the risk management process” 

we describe below certain risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition business reputation or business prospects these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended supplemented or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in our future periodic reports on form 10k form 10q and reports on other forms we file with the securities and exchange commission all forwardlooking statements about our future results of operations or other matters made by us in this annual report on form 10k in our annual report to lowe’s shareholders and in our subsequently filed reports to the securities and exchange commission as well as in our press releases and other public communications are qualified by the risks described below 

you should read these risk factors in conjunction with managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations 

we may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly changing retailing environment to address the changing shopping habits and demands and demographics of our customers 

the home improvement retailing environment like the retailing environment generally is rapidly evolving and adapting our business concept to respond to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and their changing demographics is critical to our future success in addition to our traditional large format brick and mortar retail stores many of which are located in or near suburban communities we are also increasing our urban market presence with smaller format stores and investing extensively in online sales content marketing and information searching technology capabilities failure to adapt our business concept successfully could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for the home improvement products and services we sell the rate of growth of our business and our market share 

we may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on omnichannel sales and marketing presence if we fail to deliver the capabilities required to execute on them 

the success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and changing demographics will require us to deliver large complex programs requiring different skill sets and capabilities than were required by our management employees and contractors in the past to achieve our objectives they will also require 

more integrated planning initiative prioritization and program sequencing our leadership development program for our managers at all levels is focused on aligning processes for corporate strategy business unit strategy and integrated planning to drive alignment execution and delivery of solutions including timely delivery and functionality of new technology solutions our strategic initiatives will require new competencies in many positions and our management employees and contractors will have to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access our results of operations financial condition or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain additional personnel at various levels of the company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic initiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly changing retailing environment 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omnichannel sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

access to the internet from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them our website lowescom is a sales channel for our products and is also a method of making product project and other relevant information available to them that impacts our instore sales in addition to lowescom we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire inform crosssell establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service or other cyberattacks or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of lowe’s as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services 

our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 

an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies cost reductions and sales and cash flow growth is the maintenance and ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as inventory replenishment merchandise ordering transportation receipt processing and product delivery our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to maintain improve upgrade and expand our systems 

our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer employee vendor or company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems and assets and such information from the threat of cyberattacks 

cyberattacks designed to gain access to sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving and high profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major us companies including several large retailers despite widespread recognition of the cyberattack threat and improved data protection methods despite our continued vigilance and investment in information security we may be unable to adequately anticipate or prevent a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of sensitive data should this occur it may have a material adverse effect on our reputation drive customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions or potential liability including possible punitive damages a security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of sensitive data from our information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks in addition as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other companies obligation to protect such sensitive data becomes stricter a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing and physical bank check these payment options subject us to many compliance requirements including but not limited to compliance with the payment card industry data security standards which represents a common set of industry tools and measurements to help ensure the safe handling of sensitive information they also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks gift cards and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification 

requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected we also offer cobranded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy 

many us and global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of slow economic growth or recession volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of borrowing to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending high rates of unemployment consumer debt levels fluctuations in fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters and acts of both domestic and international terrorism 

adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales 

sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects although the housing market has been strengthened by favorable interest rates and increasing home prices the large number of households that continue to have little available equity mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates that remain high tight restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing slow household formation growth rates and decreases in housing turnover through existing home sales have limited and may continue to limit consumers’ discretionary spending particularly on larger home improvement projects that are important to the growth of our business another risk to the continued recovery of the home improvement industry is that consumer interest rates will rise when the federal reserve system begins withdrawing the extraordinary economic stimulus it has provided in recent years 

if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists with expanded skill sets who can work effectively and collaboratively in an increasingly culturally diverse environment we could lose sales to our competitors 

our customers whether they are homeowners or commercial businesses expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide increasingly our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets including in some instances the ability to do inhome or telephone sales in addition in many of our stores our employees must be able to serve customers whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own a critical challenge we face is attracting and retaining a sufficiently diverse workforce that can deliver a relevant culturally competent and differentiated experience for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers also as our employees become increasingly culturally diverse our managers and sales associates must be able to manage and work collaboratively with employees whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own 

we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively or if they develop a substantially more effective or lower cost means of meeting customer needs 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the principal competitive factors in our industry include convenience customer service quality and price of merchandise and services instock levels and merchandise assortment and presentation our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our results 

our inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our business plan and financial results 

we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national brand names the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial results 

failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

no single vendor of the products we sell accounts for more than 6 of our total purchases but we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business if these vendors or service 

providers fail or are unable to perform as expected and we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to do so and potentially in some cases permanently 

if the domestic or international supply chain for our products is disrupted for any reason our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted 

we source stock and sell products from over 7000 domestic and international vendors and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success we source a large number of those products from foreign manufacturers with china continuing to be the dominant import source financial instability among key vendors political instability and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain port labor disputes retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the united states or a major source country tariffs currency exchange rates and transport availability capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs 

failure to effectively manage our third party installers could result in increased operational and legal risks 

we use third party installers to provide installation services to our customers and as the general contractor are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors including the management of the permitting licensing and quality of our third party installers our failure to effectively manage such requirements and risks could result in lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could negatively affect our business 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales profitability cash flows and financial condition 

product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe’s and the company’s brand image as a result lowe’s reputation as a retailer of high quality products and services including both national and lowe’s private brands could suffer and impact customer loyalty additionally a decline in product and service quality could result in product recalls product liability and warranty claims 

operating internationally presents unique challenges that have required us to adapt our store operations merchandising marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada and mexico and to work effectively with our joint venture partner in australia 

a significant portion of our anticipated store growth over the next five years will be in canada and mexico we are also in a joint venture with australia’s largest retailer woolworths limited to develop a network of home improvement stores for consumers in australia expanding internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks and slow the anticipated rate of such expansion 

we must comply with multiple laws and regulations that differ substantially in each country where we operate 

if we fail to comply with these laws rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied we may be subject to government enforcement ac ti on litigation damage to our reputation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties and increased cost of regulatory compliance any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance these laws rules and regulations include import and export requirements us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees and third parties with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or laws we may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry country or practice 

changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could adversely affect our business 

laws and regulations at the local regional state federal and international levels change frequently and the changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation that affect employmentlabor trade product safety   transportationlogistics energy costs health care cybersecurity tax or environmental issues could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations changes in enforcement priorities by governmental agencies charged with enforcing existing laws and regulations can increase our cost of doing business in addition our contracts with us as well as state and local government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements including audits and investigations relating to their formation administration and performance and we may be adversely affected by changes in the regulations or negative findings from audits or investigations 

future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and in the future will become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved individually or collectively is considered material

executive overview 

net earnings increased 180 to 27 billion during fiscal year 2014 and diluted earnings per share increased 266 to 271 net sales for 2014 were 562 billion a 53 increase over fiscal year 2013 comparable sales increased 43 driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 24 and a comparable transaction increase of 18 

for 2014 cash flows from operating activities were approximately 49 billion with 880 million used for capital expenditures our strong financial position and positive cash flows allowed us to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders during 2014 the company repurchased 747 million shares of stock for 39 billion and paid 822 million in dividends 

throughout 2014 we continued to build momentum as we further optimized our business model we were focused on three priorities to drive further top line growth including our enhanced sales  operations planning process building on our customer experience design capabilities and improving our relevance with the pro customer in addition in order to provide not just the products but also the services information and advice to help our customers improve their homes we are continuing to transform from a singlechannel home improvement retailer to an omnichannel home improvement company this allows us to sell products from a store online onsite or through one of our contact centers and fulfill orders in the most convenient manner for our customers 

through our sales  operations planning process we have improved seasonal planning including the cadence of product introductions promotions and staffing our sales  operations process is anchored in the customer mindset for the season the process ensures collaboration from all functions including logistics merchandising and marketing to make certain we have relevant products available to customers at the right time and those products are effectively advertised and strategically promoted to drive customer traffic 

in addition during 2014 we continued to build customer experience design capabilities we now have a dedicated customer experience design team that coordinates the creation of customer experiences that encompass the entire project from inspiration to purchase to fulfillment these experiences are rooted in research around customers shopping preferences and mindset about specific home improvement projects any experience we design has to meet three critical criteria it must be desirable to our target customer feasible  fitting within the organizations competencies and viable  or something we can deliver in a profitable and sustainable way for example during 2014 we rolled out an outdoor living experience to twothirds of our stores in advance of the spring selling season to help customers envision and create their outdoor space we displayed patio sets with coordinating rugs umbrellas and accessories along with grills and other outdoor products just as they would have expected in their own backyard this space was repurposed for the holiday décor experience in the second half of the year which inspired customers to decorate raised awareness of the breadth of holiday décor and gift offerings and provided project solutions relevant to the holiday micro seasons by providing an integrative and cohesive assortment of products inspiring and intuitive presentation and display and optimal service components across all selling channels we are able to provide better customer experiences that differentiate us in the marketplace 

we continued to experience strength with our pro customers which have performed at or above the company average comparable sales increase for 14 consecutive quarters we have a strong foundation for doing business with pro customers with our dedicated service in the stores inventory depth job lot quantities and a strong value proposition we are enhancing our product and service offering with this important customer including ensuring we have the types of products and brands the pros demand for example during 2014 we added brands such as henry ® coatings hubbell ® wiring devices grk fasteners™ and progress ® lighting all of which help make lowe’s the destination for the pro in addition we have been working to relaunch lowesforproscom a dedicated platform which provides pro customers with the ability to transact with us online and provides pros the ability to develop requisition lists access to purchase history and customized product catalogs 

looking forward 

economic forecasts for 2015 suggest moderately stronger growth in the home improvement industry stronger job and income growth and improving household financial conditions are expected to build on the momentum gained in 2014 in addition an increase in revolving credit usage should allow customers to be more willing and able to take on discretionary home improvement projects improvements in the housing market should also persist in 2015 with moderating home price growth and mortgage rates that remain historically low 

as we move into 2015 we will focus on capitalizing on market opportunities and driving profitability within an improving economy we will continue to differentiate ourselves through better customer experiences and improving our product and service offering for the pro customer we have made progress over the past few years to meet customers on their terms whenever and wherever they choose to engage and we will continue to invest in omnichannel capabilities to ensure that we are convenient and easy to do business with we also remain committed to improving our productivity and profitability in areas including store payroll marketing and efforts to leverage our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend 

  

operations 

the following tables set forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings as well as the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements 





 

return on invested capital 

return on invested capital roic is considered a nongaap financial measure we believe roic is a meaningful metric for investors because it measures how effectively the company uses capital to generate profits 

we define roic as trailing four quarters’ net operating profit after tax divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters although roic is a common financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating roic accordingly the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roic we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roic before comparing its roic to ours 

we consider return on average debt and equity to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to roic the difference between these two measures is that roic adjusts net earnings to exclude tax adjusted interest expense 

the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation to the calculation of return on average debt and equity the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows 



 

fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013   

net sales –  net sales increased 53 to 562 billion in 2014 the increase in total sales was driven primarily by the comparable sales increase of 43 the acquisition of orchard and new stores the comparable sales increase of 43 in 2014 was driven by a 24 increase in comparable average ticket and a 18 increase in comparable customer transactions comparable sales increased during each quarter of the fiscal year as we reported 09 in the first quarter 44 in the second quarter 51 in the third quarter and 73 in the fourth quarter 

all of our product categories experienced comparable sales increases for the year during 2014 we experienced comparable sales above the company average in the following product categories millwork kitchens  appliances tools  hardware and fashion fixtures targeted promotions coupled with the expansion of our project specialist programs drove comparable sales increases especially within millwork kitchens  appliances and fashion fixtures as we continued to benefit from customers increasing interest in refreshing both the interior and exterior of their homes within tools  hardware our enhanced sales  operations planning process helped us drive strong performance in power and pneumatic tools in addition flooring and outdoor power equipment performed at approximately the overall company average geographically 13 of the 14 us regions experienced increases in comparable store sales as sales performance was well balanced across the country 

gross margin  – gross margin of 3479 for 2014 represented a 20 basis point increase from 2013 and was primarily driven by cost reductions associated with our value improvement initiative which consisted of improved line review and product reset processes to better position us to meet customers product needs and drive better inventory productivity 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 gross margin decreased one basis point as a percentage of sales gross margin was negatively impacted by mix of products sold and price actions on specific categories partially offset by our value improvement program and better seasonal sellthrough 

sga  – sga expense for 2014 leveraged 46 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2013 this was primarily driven by 21 basis points of leverage associated with operating salaries as we optimized payroll hours against customer traffic we also experienced 16 basis points of leverage associated with incentive compensation due to lower attainment levels compared to the prior year and seven basis points of leverage in property taxes due to favorability in property valuations recognized in the current year in addition we experienced six basis points of leverage in advertising expense due to increased sales and five basis points of leverage in utilities due to decreased consumption due to favorable weather experienced in the current year these were partially offset by 23 basis points of deleverage in employee insurance costs due to increased claims as well as additional costs associated with the affordable care act 

sga expense during the fourth quarter leveraged 88 basis points due primarily to longlived asset impairments recorded in the prior year as well as leverage in operating salaries and property taxes 

depreciation  – depreciation expense leveraged 10 basis points for 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to the increase in sales property less accumulated depreciation decreased to 200 billion  at january 30 2015  compared to 208 billion  at january 31 2014  at january 30 2015  and january 31 2014  we owned 86  of our stores which included stores on leased land 

interest – net  – net interest expense is comprised of the following 



net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of 125 billion and 10 billion of unsecured notes in september 2014 and 2013 respectively 

income tax provision   our effective income tax rate was 369 in 2014 compared to 378 in 2013 the lower effective tax rate in 2014 was the result of the favorable settlement of certain federal tax matters during the year 

fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012   

net sales –  net sales increased 57 to 534 billion in 2013 comparable sales increased 48 in 2013 driven by a 32 increase in comparable average ticket and a 16 increase in comparable customer transactions performance for the year was strong across product categories as all of our product categories experienced comparable sales increases for the year during 2013 we experienced comparable sales above the company average in the following product categories outdoor power equipment kitchens  appliances flooring and fashion fixtures sales to pro customers also performed well during the year and experienced comparable sales above the company average 

sales during the year benefited from growth in the home improvement industry where gains in housing turnover and job growth created increased demand through our sales  operations planning process we were able to better capitalize on market demand and drive sales in big ticket categories such as outdoor power equipment kitchens  appliances and flooring which all performed above the company average furthermore we were able to make improvements in our seasonal planning and the timing of product introductions and promotions which also helped drive sales in these categories 

we continued to realize benefits from our strategic initiatives with many product categories benefiting from improved line designs and deeper inventory in key items after having completed their value improvement resets in addition we also saw benefit from our proprietary credit value proposition which offers customers the choice of 5 off every day or promotional financing 

gross margin  – gross margin of 3459 for 2013 represented a 29 basis point increase from 2012 gross margin was positively impacted by 45 basis points resulting from our value improvement initiative this was partially offset by a negative 

impact of 15 basis points as a result of higher penetration of our proprietary credit value proposition which increased 145 basis points over the prior year and was approximately 255 of sales 

sga  – sga expense for 2013 leveraged 16 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2012 this was driven by 17 basis points of leverage associated with casualty insurance as we cycled a reduction in the discount rate applied in the prior year we also experienced nine basis points of leverage due to greater longlived asset impairments and discontinued project expenses in the prior year and eight basis points of leverage in advertising expense due to higher sales in addition we experienced eight basis points of leverage in contract labor expense as a result of lower spending on information technology projects in the current year these were partially offset by 14 basis points of deleverage associated with incentive compensation due to higher attainment levels and eight basis points of deleverage as a result of reset and remerchandising activity associated with efforts to improve customer experiences we also experienced eight basis points of deleverage due to higher store repair and maintenance expense 

depreciation  – depreciation expense leveraged 27 basis points for 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to the increase in sales as well as assets becoming fully depreciated property less accumulated depreciation decreased to 208 billion  at january 31 2014  compared to 215 billion at february 1 2013  at january 31 2014  and february 1 2013  we owned 86 and 89 of our stores respectively which included stores on leased land 

interest – net  – net interest expense is comprised of the following 



net interest expense increased primarily as a result of a favorable tax settlement that resulted in a reduced interest accrual in 2012 in addition to increased expense as a result of the net increase in longterm debt 

lowe’s business outlook 

as of february 25 2015  the date of our fourth quarter 2014  earnings release we expected total sales in 2015  to increase 45 to 5 and comparable sales to increase 4 to 45 we expected to open 15 to 20 home improvement and hardware stores during 2015  in addition earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales operating margin were expected to increase 80 to 100 basis points and the effective tax rate was expected to be approximately 381 diluted earnings per share of approximately 329 were expected for the fiscal year ending january 29 2016  our guidance assumed approximately 38 billion in share repurchases during 2015  

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 versus 2013 was primarily driven by changes in working capital and an increase in net earnings the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for 2014 versus 2013 was primarily driven by the acquisition of orchard in the prior year and a reduction in capital expenditures partially offset by an increase in net contributions to equity method investments in the current year the increase in net cash used in financing activities for 2014 versus 2013 was driven primarily by repayments of shortterm borrowings 

sources of liquidity 

in addition to our cash flows from operations liquidity is provided by our shortterm borrowing facilities on august 29 2014 we entered into a new five year unsecured revolving credit agreement the 2014 credit facility to replace the 2011 second amended and restated credit agreement dated october 2011 the 2014 credit facility provides for borrowings up to 175 billion and expires in august 2019 subject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the 2014 credit facility we may increase the aggregate availability under the facility by an additional 500 million the 2014 credit facility supports our commercial paper program and has a 500 million letter of credit sublimit letters of credit issued pursuant to the 2014 credit facility reduce the amount available for borrowing under its terms 

borrowings made are unsecured and are priced at fixed rates based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the 2014 credit facility thirteen banking institutions are participating in the 2014 credit facility the 2014 credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants which include maintenance of an adjusted debt leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement we were in compliance with those covenants at january 30 2015  in addition there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the 2014 credit facility and no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program at january 30 2015  for additional information about the 2014 credit facility see the summary of certain terms thereof that is included in the current report on form 8k we filed on september 2 2014 with the securities and exchange commission 

we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both shortterm and longterm bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new longterm debt the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected however by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard  poor’s sp and moody’s as of march 31 2015 which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds although we currently do not expect a downgrade in our debt ratings our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 



we believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate not only for our operating requirements but also for investments in information technology investments in our existing stores expansion plans and acquisitions if any and to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases over the next 12 months there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price in addition we do not have a significant amount of cash held in foreign affiliates that is unavailable to fund domestic operations 

cash requirements 

capital expenditures 

our fiscal 2015  capital forecast is approximately 14 billion inclusive of approximately 200 million of lease commitments resulting in a planned net cash outflow of 12 billion investments in our existing stores are expected to account for approximately 40 of net cash outflow including investments in store equipment resets and remerchandising approximately 30 of the planned net cash outflow is for corporate programs including investments to enhance the customer experience as well as enhancements to the corporate infrastructure in addition approximately 30 of the planned net cash outflow is for store expansion our expansion plans for 2015  consist of 15 to 20 new home improvement and hardware stores approximately half of which will be leased 

debt and capital 

in september 2014 the company issued 125 billion  of unsecured notes in three tranches 450 million  of floating rate notes maturing in september 2019 450 million  of 3125  notes maturing in september 2024 and 350 million  of 425  notes maturing in september 2044 the 2019 2024 and 2044 notes were issued at discounts of approximately 2 million  6 million  and 4 million  respectively the 2019 notes will bear interest at a floating rate reset quarterly equal to the threemonth libor  plus 0420   0658  as of january 30 2015 interest on the 2019 notes is payable quarterly in arrears in march june september and december of each year until maturity beginning in december 2014 interest on the 2024 and 2044 notes is payable semiannually in arrears in march and september of each year until maturity beginning in march 2015 

the discounts associated with these issuances which include the underwriting and issuance discounts are recorded in longterm debt and are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes 

dividends declared during fiscal 2014  totaled 858 million our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of 2014  was paid in fiscal 2015  and totaled 222 million 

we have an ongoing share repurchase program that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private offmarket transactions shares purchased under the repurchase program are retired and returned to 

authorized and unissued status on january 31 2014 the companys board of directors authorized a 50 billion share repurchase program with no expiration as of january 30 2015  the company had 24 billion remaining available under this authorization with no expiration date on march 20 2015 the companys board of directors authorized an additional 50 billion share repurchase program with no expiration in fiscal 2015  the company expects to repurchase shares totaling 38 billion through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off market transactions in accordance with sec regulations 

our ratio of debt to equity plus debt was 533 and 470 as of january 30 2015  and january 31 2014  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at january 30 2015  



 

at january 30 2015  our reserve for uncertain tax positions including penalties and interest was 9 million all of which was classified as a current liability at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this form 10k requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory 

description 

we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels sales trends and historical experience during 2014  our reserve decreased approximately 16 million to 52 million  as of january 30 2015  primarily due to a reduction in obsolete inventory 

we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories during 2014  the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately 4 million to 162 million  as of january 30 2015  

in addition we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business principally as a result of purchase volumes sales early payments or promotions of vendors’ products generally these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor’s product therefore we treat these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors’ products are recorded as an offset to the related expense 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions however changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves likewise changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and results of physical inventories we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value 

for vendor funds we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves however it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves a 10 change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 3 million for 2014  a 10 change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 10 million for 2014  

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective longterm estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 

longlived asset impairment 

description 

we review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable when evaluating locations for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead 

we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to longlived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location’s asset carrying values may not be recoverable for operating locations our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a 12month period for those locations that have been open 

in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment including individual locations’ execution of their operating plans and local market conditions including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe’s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location’s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location management makes assumptions incorporating local market conditions about key store variables including sales growth rates gross margin and controllable expenses such as store payroll and occupancy expense as well as asset residual values or lease rates an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 

we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations which requires discounting projected future cash flows this involves making assumptions regarding both a location’s future cash flows as described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows including estimated sales margin and controllable expenses and assumptions about market performance for operating locations and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during 2014 10 operating locations experienced a triggering event and were evaluated for recoverability three of the 10 operating locations were determined to be impaired we recorded impairment losses related to these three operating locations of 26 million during 2014  compared to impairment losses of 26 million related to one operating location impaired during 2013  

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values our actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment losses 

seven of the 10 operating locations that experienced a triggering event during 2014  were determined to be recoverable and therefore were not impaired for all of these seven locations the expected undiscounted cash flows substantially exceeded the net book value of the location’s assets for these seven locations a 10 reduction in projected sales used to estimate future cash flows at the latest date these operating locations were evaluated for impairment would have resulted in the impairment of six of these locations and increased recognized impairment losses by 71 million 

we analyzed other assumptions made in estimating the future cash flows of the operating locations evaluated for impairment but the sensitivity of those assumptions was not significant to the estimates 

store closing lease obligations 

description 

when locations under operating leases are closed we recognize a liability for the fair value of future contractual obligations associated with the leased location the fair value of the store closing lease obligation is determined using an expected present value cash flow model incorporating future minimum lease payments property taxes utilities common area maintenance and other ongoing expenses net of estimated sublease income and other recoverable items discounted at a creditadjusted risk free rate the expected present value cash flow model uses a probability weighted scenario approach that assigns varying cash flows to certain scenarios based on the expected likelihood of outcomes estimating the fair value involves making assumptions regarding estimated sublease income by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific 

markets being evaluated the information includes comparable lease rates of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for leasing these assets subsequent changes to the liability including a change resulting from a revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flows are recognized in the period of the change 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our store closing lease liability calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows primarily related to estimated sublease income and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during 2014  the company did not close or relocate any stores subject to operating leases during 2013  the company relocated two stores subject to operating leases expenses for store closing lease obligations included 12 million and 6 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively related to adjustments for previously closed or relocated locations 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the expected future cash flows of closed locations under operating leases during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in estimating expected future cash flows our store closing lease obligation losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated losses a 10 change in the store closing lease liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 3 million for 2014  

selfinsurance 

description 

we are selfinsured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation automobile general and product liability extended protection plan and certain medical and dental claims our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable is limited to 2 million per occurrence involving workers’ compensation 5 million per occurrence involving general or product liability and 10 million per occurrence involving automobile we do not have any insurance coverage for selfinsured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims selfinsurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for selfinsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during 2014  our selfinsurance liability increased approximately 1 million to 905 million  as of january 30 2015  

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposures including payroll sales and vehicle units as well as the frequency lag and severity of claims 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded selfinsurance liabilities a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 55 million for 2014  a 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately 19 million for 2014  

revenue recognition 

description 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the effects of future events that cannot be determined with certainty 

we sell separatelypriced extended protection plan contracts under a lowe’sbranded program for which the company is ultimately selfinsured the company recognizes revenues from extended protection plan sales on a straightline basis over the respective contract term extended protection plan contract terms primarily range from one to four years from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer’s warranty as applicable the company consistently groups and evaluates extended protection plan contracts based on the characteristics of the underlying products and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected losses a loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected costs of performing services under the contracts exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition costs and related deferred revenue associated with the contracts   deferred revenues associated with the extended protection plan contracts were 730 million  as of january 30 2015  and january 31 2014  

we defer revenue and cost of sales associated with settled transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed revenue is deferred based on the actual amounts received we use historical gross margin rates to estimate the adjustment to cost of sales for these transactions during 2014  deferred revenues associated with these transactions increased 84 million to 545 million as of january 30 2015  

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

for extended protection plans there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected losses as a result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contracts and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contracts there is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of costs of performing services under these contracts 

for the deferral of revenue and cost of sales associated with transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed there is judgment inherent in our estimates of gross margin rates 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contracts during the past three fiscal years we currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract losses on our extended protection plan contracts although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected losses under the extended protection plan contracts it is possible that actual results could differ from our estimates in addition if future evidence indicates that the costs of performing services under these contracts are incurred on other than a straightline basis the timing of revenue recognition under these contracts could change a 10 change in the amount of revenue recognized in 2014  under these contracts would have affected net earnings by approximately 19 million 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to reverse net sales and cost of sales related to amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates related to the impact to cost of sales for these transactions however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may incur additional income or expense a 10 change in the estimate of the gross margin rates applied to these transactions would have affected net earnings by approximately 9 million in 2014  

disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements 

we speak throughout this annual report on form 10k in forwardlooking statements about our future but particularly in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the words “believe” “expect” “will” “should” suggest and other similar expressions are intended to identify those forwardlooking statements while we believe our expectations are reasonable they are not guarantees of future performance our actual results could differ substantially from our expectations 

for a detailed description of the risks and uncertainties that we are exposed to you should read the “risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k to the united states securities and exchange commission all forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this report or in the case of any document incorporated by reference the date of that document all subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section and in the “risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forwardlooking statements to reflect events circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and consists primarily of fixedrate instruments therefore providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instruments 

commodity price risk 

we purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control we believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices the selling prices of these commodity products are influenced in part by the market price we pay which is determined by industry supply and demand 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition and results of operations 




 item 9  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a  controls and procedures 

the companys management with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rule 13a15e promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act based upon their evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the company files or submits under the exchange act with the securities and exchange commission the sec 1 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and 2 is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

 item 1a  risk factors 

we have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys external research planning processes risk mapping analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational financial environmental reputational strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business for more information about our risk management process which is administered by our chief risk officer and includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify see the description included in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders as defined in item 10 of part iii of this annual report on form 10k under “board’s role in the risk management process” 

we describe below all known material risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or business prospects these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended supplemented or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in our future periodic reports on form 10k form 10q and reports on other forms we file with the securities and exchange commission all forwardlooking statements about our future results of operations or other matters made by us in this annual report on form 10k in our annual report to lowe’s shareholders and in our subsequently filed reports to the securities and exchange commission as well as in our press releases and other public communications are qualified by the risks described below 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy 

general economic factors and other conditions both domestically and internationally may adversely affect the us economy the global economy and our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of slow economic growth or recession volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of borrowing to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income sustained high rates of unemployment consumer debt levels increasing fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters and acts of both domestic and international terrorism the sluggish and uneven pace of the recovery from the deep global recession could continue to have an adverse effect on the rate of growth of discretionary spending by consumers and the share of such spending on home improvement products and services 

adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales 

sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects although the housing market has been strengthened by favorable interest rates and lower home prices the large number of households that continue to have little available equity mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates that remain abnormally high tighter restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing slower household formation growth rates and lower growth in housing turnover through existing home sales have limited and may continue to limit consumers’ discretionary spending particularly on larger home improvement projects that are important to the growth of our business another potential risk to the home 

improvement industry is the possibility that interest rates will rise as the federal reserve system follows through in 2014 and 2015 on its announced plans to gradually withdraw the economic stimulus provided in recent years 

changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could adversely affect our business 

laws and regulations at the local regional state federal and international levels change frequently and the changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation that affect employmentlabor trade product safety transportationlogistics energy costs health care cybersecurity tax or environmental issues could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations changes in enforcement priorities by governmental agencies charged with enforcing existing laws and regulations can increase our cost of doing business in addition our contracts with us as well as state and local government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements including audits and investigations relating to their formation administration and performance and we may be adversely affected by changes in the regulations or negative findings from audits or investigations 

our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer employee vendor or company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems and assets and such information from the threat of cyberattacks 

cyberattacks designed to gain access to sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving and high profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred recently at a number of major us companies including several large retailers despite widespread recognition of the cyberattack threat and improved data protection methods while we have invested in the protection of our information technology and maintain what we believe are adequate security procedures and controls over the company’s records and intellectual property in addition to financial and other individually identifiable customer employee and vendor data provided to us a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of sensitive data could nonetheless occur and have a material adverse effect on our reputation drive customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions or potential liability including possible punitive damages an electronic security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of sensitive data from our information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks in addition as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other companies obligation to protect such sensitive data becomes stricter a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits 

we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the competitive environment in which we operate is particularly challenging during periods of slower economic growth and higher unemployment the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores customer service quality and price of merchandise and services instock levels and merchandise assortment and presentation our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our results 

our inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our business plan and financial results 

we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national brand names the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial results 

operating internationally presents unique challenges that have required us to adapt our store operations merchandising marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada and mexico and to work effectively with our joint venture partner in australia 

a significant portion of our anticipated store growth over the next five years will be in canada and mexico we are also in a joint venture with australia’s largest retailer woolworths limited to develop a network of home improvement stores for consumers in australia expanding internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks and slow the anticipated rate of such expansion 

if the domestic or international supply chain for our products is disrupted our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted 

we source stock and sell products from over 7000 domestic and international vendors and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success we source a large number of those products from foreign manufacturers with china continuing to be the dominant import source financial instability among key vendors political instability or labor unrest in source countries retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the united states or a major source country tariffs currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs 

because of our operations in multiple countries we must comply with multiple laws and regulations that differ substantially from country to country 

if we fail to comply with these laws rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied we may be subject to government enforcement ac ti on litigation damage to our reputation civil and criminal liability damages fines and penalties and increased cost of regulatory compliance any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance these laws rules and regulations include import and export requirements us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees and third parties with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or laws we may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry country or practice 

if we are unable to secure or develop and implement sufficiently robust new technologies to deliver business process solutions within the appropriate time frame cost and functionality our strategic initiatives that are dependent upon these technologies may not be successful 

the success of our strategic initiatives designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers’ expenditures on home improvement projects is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the new business initiatives we are developing now and will be developing in the future would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

we may be unable to make the transformational changes we are undertaking in our business model 

we are adapting our business model to meet our customers’ changing expectations that we will not only sell them the products and services they need and want but also deliver better customer experiences we will offer a cohesive group of products that provide relevant occasionbased solutions and will present them in an inspiring manner our strategies require transformational changes to our business model and will require new competencies in some positions and our employees and independent contractors such as thirdparty installers and repair technicians will not only have to understand nontraditional selling platforms but also commit to fundamental changes in lowe’s culture and the processes through which they have traditionally interacted with customers to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes we may be unable to operationalize our strategic initiatives which are designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers’ expenditures on home improvement projects the many challenges our management faces as we adapt our business model also increase the risk that we may not achieve our objectives 

if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists with expanded skill sets who can work effectively and collaboratively in an increasingly culturally diverse environment we could lose sales to our competitors 

our customers whether they are homeowners or commercial businesses expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide increasingly our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets including in some instances the ability to do inhome or telephone sales in addition in many of our stores our employees must be able to serve customers whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own a critical challenge we face is attracting and retaining a sufficiently diverse workforce that can deliver a relevant culturally competent and differentiated experience for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers also as our employees become increasingly culturally diverse our managers and sales associates must be able to manage and work collaboratively with employees whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own 

our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 

an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies cost reductions and sales and cash flow growth is the maintenance and ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as inventory replenishment merchandise ordering transportation receipt processing and product delivery our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to maintain improve upgrade and expand our systems 

  

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our multichannel sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

access to the internet from computers tablets smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them our website lowescom is a sales channel for our products and is also a method of making product project and other relevant information available to them that impacts our instore sales in addition to lowescom we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire inform crosssell establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service or other cyberattacks or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of lowe’s as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks that could increase our operating costs expose us to fraud subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts gift cards direct debit from a customer’s bank account consumer invoicing and physical bank check these payment options subject us to compliance requirements they also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks gift cards and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected we also offer cobranded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated 

failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

no single vendor of the products we sell accounts for more than 6 of our total purchases but we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business if these vendors or service providers fail or are unable to perform as expected and we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to do so and potentially in some cases permanently 

failure to effectively manage our third party installers could result in increased operational and legal risks 

we use third party installers to provide installation services to our customers and as the general contractor are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors including the management of the permitting licensing and quality of our third party installers our failure to effectively manage such requirements and risks could result in lost sales fines and lawsuits as well as damage to our reputation which could negatively affect our business 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales profitability cash flows and financial condition 

product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe’s and the company’s brand image as a result lowe’s reputation as a retailer of high quality products and services including both national and lowe’s private brands could suffer and impact customer loyalty additionally a decline in product and service quality could result in product recalls product liability and warranty claims 

future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and in the future will become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved individually or collectively is considered material

executive overview 

net earnings increased 167 to 23 billion during fiscal year 2013 and diluted earnings per share increased 266 to 214 net sales for 2013 were 534 billion a 57 increase over fiscal year 2012 comparable sales were 48 driven by comparable average ticket increase of 32 and a comparable transaction increase of 16 

for 2013 cash flows from operating activities were approximately 41 billion with 940 million used for capital expenditures our strong financial position and positive cash flows allowed us to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders during 2013 the company repurchased 867 million shares of stock for 37 billion and paid 733 million in dividends 

2013 progress 

as of the end of fiscal year 2013 we have substantially completed our initiatives to enhance retail relevance including value improvement product differentiation and our store labor investment value improvement has enhanced our line designs making them more relevant to each of the markets we serve and enabled us to maintain better instock positions as well as to simplify deal structures that allow us to offer competitive prices every day as of the end of fiscal year 2013 we have finished the first round of value improvement line reviews and substantially all of the associated resets value improvement is now fully operationalized which means the improved line review and product reset processes are woven into our everyday business and we are now better positioned to meet customers’ product needs and drive better inventory productivity 

product differentiation has driven excitement in our stores through better display techniques including our revised end cap strategy which has allowed us to focus on highly innovative products and significant values and to showcase private and national brands we also revamped promotional spaces to better promote seasonally relevant high value items to drive sales and improve the shopping experience product differentiation has been executed in 1400 stores as of the end of fiscal year 2013 and will be rolled out to the remaining us home improvement stores in the first half of 2014 in addition as part of our sales  operations planning process we will continue to look for ways to manage this space in its most productive way 

during 2013 we had also identified an opportunity to better serve customers and close more sales during peak weekday hours by increasing the assistance available in the aisles in the second half of 2013 we have focused on making the store labor investment more productive by refining our allocation of these hours by store and by selling department as we cycle the introduction of the store labor investment in the first quarter of 2014 we expect to obtain greater leverage which will contribute to greater 2014 operating profitability 

2014 priorities 

during 2014 economic forecasts suggest moderately accelerating growth in the home improvement industry stronger job and income growth should create a more favorable environment for consumer spending which coupled with the lagged benefit of 

the housing recovery should generate continued growth in the home improvement industry while credit conditions remain tight relative to the housing boom years conditions are improving and household finances continue to strengthen which should also contribute to stronger growth in 2014 

in 2014 we will build on the momentum established in 2013 as we further optimize our business model we will also continue to focus on three priorities to drive further topline growth first we will use our enhanced sales  operations planning process to improve seasonal planning by market second we will improve our product and service offering for the pro customer third we will continue building customer experience design capabilities 

through our sales  operations planning process we have addressed an opportunity to improve seasonal planning including the cadence of product introductions promotions and staffing while we have always planned and executed these seasons in store previous planning was completed functionbyfunction and reconciled to minimize conflicts now the process starts earlier and is anchored on the customer mindset for the season the process more thoroughly considers detailed input from all functions to determine resource allocation and it enables lowe’s to provide a consistent message and experience across all selling channels 

we also have an opportunity to better capitalize on the pro market which is growing faster than the consumer market we will do this by enhancing our product and service offering with this important customer including ensuring we have the types of products and brands pros demand we also want to ensure we reach our pro through multiple channels whether in the store where we have dedicated specialists assigned to answer questions and dedicated loaders to help them get back to the job quickly at the pro’s place of business where our account executive proservices helps regional maintenance repair and operations customers order and replenish products across multiple stores or through our national account representatives who assist customers doing business with lowe’s across the country in the second quarter of 2014 we will relaunch lowesforproscom which will provide a dedicated platform for pro customers to purchase online from lowe’s this site will also allow pros to access contract pricing develop requisition lists and view purchase history and will be enabled for convenient mobile access 

in addition we have an opportunity to more broadly enhance the customer experience we are developing a process to coordinate the elements of great occasionbased customer experiences that provide relevant solutions that we will present in an inspiring manner with all selling channels in mind these experiences must meet three critical criteria they must be desirable to our target customer they must be feasible and they must be viable  something we can deliver in a profitable and sustainable way in 2014 we will continue building these customer experience design capabilities we will also introduce a limited number of changes to our stores and website that will become a stage for future experiences 

our topline performance improved in 2013 as a result of our focus on cross functional collaboration and consistent execution along with our strategic initiatives which allowed us to more fully capitalize on market demand in 2014 we are focused on improving our profitability even while investing in key capabilities to drive sales growth in addition to operationalizing and refining the 2013 initiatives we will focus on driving more of our revenue growth to the bottom line through expense control and disciplined execution of our plans 

beyond 2014 

over the longerterm we remain committed to satisfying customers’ needs whenever and wherever they choose to engage with us and to differentiating with better customer experiences than any other home improvement provider we have been investing in infrastructure both systems and processes our focus is on transforming our current multichannel offering to an omnichannel experience with our brand through enhanced customer service tools we expect to improve our associates’ ability to sell seamlessly across channels to introduce new project management tools and to expand fulfillment capabilities beyond buy online pickup in store or parcel fulfillment of online orders both of which we do today we will cultivate personal and simple connections with customers over and above what we have accomplished to date with mylowes these new capabilities are projected to be in market in 2015 

even as we focus on optimizing our business model driving profitability and capitalizing on market opportunities within an improving economy we are investing in customer experience and omnichannel capabilities to drive future sales growth and to create simpler and differentiated home improvement experiences for customers 

operations 

the following tables set forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings as well as the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements 





1   fiscal years 2013  and 2012  had 52 weeks fiscal year 2011  had 53 weeks 

2   ebit margin also referred to as operating margin is defined as earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales 

3   a comparable location is defined as a location that has been open longer than 13 months   a location that is identified for 

  relocation is no longer considered comparable one month prior to its relocation the relocated location must then remain 

  open longer than 13 months to be considered comparable a location we have decided to close is no longer considered 

  comparable as of the beginning of the month in which we announce its closing comparable sales include online sales 

4   comparable sales are based on comparable 52week periods for 2013  and 2012  and comparable 53week periods for 2011  

5   average ticket is defined as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions 

6 the number of stores as of fiscal year end 2013 includes 72 stores from the acquisition of the majority of assets of orchard on august 30 2013 the average store selling square footage is approximately 36000 for an orchard store 

7   average store size selling square feet is defined as sales floor square feet divided by the number of stores open at the end of 

  the period the average lowe’s home improvement store has approximately 112000 square feet of retail selling space while 

  the average orchard store has approximately 36000 square feet of retail selling space 

8   return on average assets is defined as net earnings divided by average total assets for the last five quarters 

9   return on average shareholders’ equity is defined as net earnings divided by average shareholders’ equity for the last five 

  quarters 

10   return on invested capital is a nongaap financial measure see below for additional information 

return on invested capital 

return on invested capital roic is considered a nongaap financial measure we believe roic is a meaningful metric for investors because it measures how effectively the company uses capital to generate profits 

we define roic as trailing four quarters’ net operating profit after tax divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters although roic is a common financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating roic accordingly the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roic we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roic before comparing its roic to ours 

we consider return on average debt and equity to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to roic the difference between these two measures is that roic adjusts net earnings to exclude tax adjusted interest expense 

the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation to the calculation of return on average debt and equity the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows 



1   income tax adjustment is defined as earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by the effective tax rate 

2   average debt and equity is defined as average debt including current maturities and shortterm borrowings plus total equity 

  for the last five quarters 

fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012   

net sales –  net sales increased 57 to 534 billion in 2013 comparable sales increased 48 in 2013 driven by a 32 increase in comparable average ticket and a 16 increase in comparable customer transactions performance for the year was strong across product categories as all of our product categories experienced comparable sales increases for the year during 2013 we experienced comparable sales above the company average in the following product categories outdoor power equipment kitchens  appliances rough plumbing  electrical flooring and fashion fixtures sales to pro customers also performed well during the year and experienced comparable sales above the company average 

sales during the year benefited from growth in the home improvement industry where gains in housing turnover and job growth created increased demand through our sales  operations planning process we were able to better capitalize on market demand and drive sales in big ticket categories such as outdoor power equipment kitchens  appliances and flooring which all performed above the company average furthermore we were able to make improvements in our seasonal planning and the timing of product introductions and promotions which also helped drive sales in these categories 

we continued to realize benefits from our strategic initiatives with many product categories benefiting from improved line designs and deeper inventory in key items after having completed their value improvement resets in addition we also saw benefit from our proprietary credit value proposition which offers customers the choice of 5 off every day or promotional financing 

gross margin  – gross margin of 3459 for 2013 represented a 29 basis point increase from 2012 gross margin was positively impacted by 45 basis points resulting from our value improvement initiative this was partially offset by a negative impact of 15 basis points as a result of higher penetration of our proprietary credit value proposition which increased 145 basis points over the prior year and was approximately 255 of sales 

sga  – sga expense for 2013 leveraged 16 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2012 this was driven by 17 basis points of leverage associated with casualty insurance as we cycled a reduction in the discount rate applied in the prior year we also experienced nine basis points of leverage due to greater longlived asset impairments and discontinued project expenses in the prior year and eight basis points of leverage in advertising expense due to higher sales in addition we experienced eight basis points of leverage in contract labor expense as a result of lower spending on information technology projects in the current year these were partially offset by 14 basis points of deleverage associated with incentive compensation due to higher attainment levels and eight basis points of deleverage as a result of reset and remerchandising activity associated with efforts to improve customer experiences we also experienced eight basis points of deleverage due to higher store repair and maintenance expense 

depreciation  – depreciation expense leveraged 27 basis points for 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to the increase in sales as well as assets becoming fully depreciated property less accumulated depreciation decreased to 208 billion  at january 31 2014  compared to 215 billion  at february 1 2013  at january 31 2014  and february 1 2013  we owned 86  and 89 of our stores respectively which included stores on leased land 

interest – net  – net interest expense is comprised of the following 



net interest expense increased primarily as a result of a favorable tax settlement that resulted in a reduced interest accrual in 2012 in addition to increased expense as a result of the net increase in longterm debt 

fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011   

for the purpose of the following discussion comparable sales comparable average ticket and comparable customer transactions are based on comparable 52week periods 

net sales –  net sales increased 06 to 505 billion in 2012 the additional week in 2011 and resulting week shift in 2012 negatively impacted sales comparisons by 692 million or 14 comparable sales increased 14 in 2012 driven by a 09 increase in comparable average ticket and a 05 increase in comparable customer transactions our key initiatives value improvement and product differentiation drove 40 basis points of the increase in sales in addition our proprietary credit value proposition contributed 65 basis points to the increase in sales geographically all operating divisions in the us delivered positive comparable sales for the year as sales performance was well balanced in 2012 furthermore we continued to see strength in our pro services business which outperformed the company average 

we experienced comparable sales above the company average in the following product categories during 2012 outdoor power equipment paint seasonal living tools  hardware rough plumbing  electrical and home fashions storage  cleaning in addition fashion fixtures and flooring performed at approximately the overall company average comparable sales in outdoor power equipment were positively impacted by favorable weather in the first half of the year combined with effective promotions in addition storm response efforts associated with hurricane sandy also positively impacted comparable sales in outdoor power equipment due to increased generator sales comparable sales in paint were positively impacted by new product offerings and inflation throughout the year 

comparable sales were below the company average in millwork kitchens  appliances lumber  building materials and lawn  garden difficult comparisons to prior year promotional activity led to decreased comparable sales in millwork and kitchens  appliances comparable sales in lumber  building material were negatively impacted by the timing of storm recovery and repair efforts in 2012 as compared to 2011 partially offset by the favorable impact of inflation throughout the year in addition comparable sales in lawn  garden were negatively impacted by extreme heat and drought conditions in the first half of the year slightly offset by improved inventory planning and attachment rates in the second half of the year 

gross margin  – gross margin of 343 for 2012 represented a 26 basis point decrease from 2011 primarily driven by an unfavorable 19 basis point impact related to our proprietary credit value proposition in addition we experienced a seven basis point unfavorable impact to margin related to pricing and promotional activity 

sga  – the 84 basis point decrease in sga expense as a percentage of sales from 2011 to 2012 was primarily driven by 81 basis points of leverage due to longlived asset impairment and other costs associated with the 27 store closures and discontinued projects in 2011 we also experienced approximately 35 basis points of leverage associated with our proprietary credit program which was driven by increased portfolio income as a result of continued growth in the program these were partially offset by deleverage of approximately 15 basis points associated with incentive compensation due to higher attainment levels compared to targets for storebased employees relative to last year in addition we experienced nine basis points of deleverage in contract labor associated with information technology projects to improve customer experiences 

depreciation  – depreciation expense deleveraged six basis points for 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due to higher depreciation associated with it capital investments made to improve customer experiences which have shorter average useful lives property less accumulated depreciation decreased to 215 billion  at february 1 2013  compared to 220 billion  at february 3 2012  at february 1 2013  and february 3 2012  we owned 89 of our stores which included stores on leased land 

interest – net  – net interest expense is comprised of the following 



net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of 10 billion and 20 billion of unsecured notes in november 2011 and april 2012 respectively partially offset by favorable tax settlements that resulted in a reduced interest accrual during 2012 

income tax provision –  our   effective income tax rate was 376  in 2012  compared to 367  in 2011  the lower effective tax rate in 2011 was the result of the recognition of onetime federal employee retention benefits from the federal hire hiring incentives to restore employment retention tax credit as well as the favorable settlement of certain state tax matters in the third quarter of 2011 

lowe’s business outlook 

as of february 26 2014  the date of our fourth quarter 2013  earnings release we expected total sales in 2014  to increase approximately 5 and comparable sales to increase approximately 4 we expected to open approximately 15 home improvement stores and five orchard stores during 2014  in addition earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales operating margin were expected to increase approximately 65 basis points and the effective tax rate was expected to be approximately 381 diluted earnings per share of 260 were expected for the fiscal year ending january 30 2015  our guidance assumed approximately 34 billion in share repurchases during 2014  spread evenly across the four quarters 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2013 versus 2012 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings the increase in net cash used in investing activities for 2013 versus 2012 was driven by a decrease in the net cash flows from purchase and sale of investments and the acquisition of orchard partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures the decrease in net cash used in financing activities for 2013 was driven primarily by a decrease in cash used to repurchase shares which included shares repurchased under our share repurchase program and shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities upon vesting of restricted stock awards the repayment of unsecured notes that matured in the prior year and an increase in shortterm borrowings in the current year these were partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by the issuance of long termdebt as a result of the issuance of 10 billion of unsecured notes in september 2013 versus the issuance of 20 billion of unsecured notes in april 2012 

sources of liquidity 

in addition to our cash flows from operations liquidity is provided by our shortterm borrowing facilities we have a 175 billion senior credit facility that expires in october 2016 the senior credit facility supports our commercial paper program and has a 500 million letter of credit sublimit letters of credit issued pursuant to the senior credit facility reduce the amount available for borrowing under its terms borrowings made are unsecured and are priced at fixed rates based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the senior credit facility the senior credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants which include maintenance of a debt leverage ratio as defined by the senior credit facility we were in compliance with those covenants at january 31 2014  thirteen banking institutions are participating in the senior credit facility at january 31 2014  we had 386 million of outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program and no letters of credit under the senior credit facility 

we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both shortterm and longterm bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new longterm debt the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected however by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard  poor’s sp and mood y’s as of march 31 2014 whi ch we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds although we currently do not expect a downgrade in our debt ratings our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 



we believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate not only for our operating requirements but also for investments in information technology investments in our existing stores expansion plans and acquisitions if any and to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases over the next 12 months there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price in addition we do not have a significant amount of cash held in foreign affiliates that is unavailable to fund domestic operations 

cash requirements 

capital expenditures 

our fiscal 2014  capital budget is approximately 125 billion inclusive of approximately 50 million of lease commitments resulting in a planned net cash outflow of 12 billion investments in our existing stores are expected to account for approximately 40 of net cash outflow including investments in store equipment resets and remerchandising approximately 30 of the planned net cash outflow is for investments in corporate infrastructure including enhancements in information technology our expansion plans for 2014  consist of approximately 15 new home improvement stores and five new orchard stores nine of the home improvement stores and none of the orchard stores are expected to be owned approximately 13 of the new home improvement stores are expected to be on leased land store expansion will account for approximately 30 of the planned net cash outflow 

debt and capital 

in september 2013  we issued 10 billion of unsecured notes in two tranches 500 million of 3875 notes maturing in september 2023 and 500 million of 50 notes maturing in september 2043 the 2023 and 2043 notes were issued at discounts of approximately 5 million and 9 million respectively interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears in march and september of each year until maturity beginning in march 2014  

the discounts associated with these issuances which include the underwriting and issuance discounts are recorded in longterm debt and are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes 

dividends declared during fiscal 2013  totaled 741 million our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of 2013  was paid in fiscal 2014  and totaled 186 million 

we have an ongoing share repurchase program that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private offmarket transactions shares purchased under the repurchase program are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status on february 1 2013  the companys board of directors authorized a 50 billion share repurchase program with no expiration as of january 31 2014 the company had 13 billion remaining available under this authorization on january 31 2014  the companys board of directors authorized an additional 50 billion of share repurchases with no expiration increasing the total share repurchases authorized as of fiscal year end january 31 2014 to 63 billion in fiscal 2014  the company expects to repurchase shares totaling 34 billion through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off market transactions in accordance with sec regulations 

our ratio of debt to equity plus debt was 470 and 396 as of january 31 2014  and february 1 2013  respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at january 31 2014  



1   amounts do not include taxes common area maintenance insurance or contingent rent because these amounts have 

  historically been insignificant 

2   represents commitments related to certain marketing and information technology programs and purchases of merchandise 

  inventory 

3   letters of credit are issued primarily for insurance and construction contracts 

at january 31 2014  our reserve for uncertain tax positions including penalties and interest was 69 million of which 7 million was classified as a current liability and 62 million was classified as a noncurrent liability at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this form 10k requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory 

description 

we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels sales trends and historical experience during 2013  our reserve increased approximately 11 million to 68 million  as of january 31 2014  

we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories during 2013  the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately 16 million to 158 million  as of january 31 2014  

in addition we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business principally as a result of purchase volumes sales early payments or promotions of vendors’ products generally these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor’s product therefore we treat these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors’ products are recorded as an offset to the related expense 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions however changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves likewise changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and results of physical inventories we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of nonproductive inventory and assumptions about net realizable value 

for vendor funds we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves however it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves a 10 change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 4 million for 2013  a 10 change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 10 million for 2013  

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective longterm estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 

longlived asset impairment 

description 

we review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable when evaluating locations for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead 

we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to longlived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location’s asset carrying values may not be recoverable for operating locations our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a 12month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment including individual locations’ execution of their operating plans and local market conditions including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe’s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location’s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location management makes assumptions incorporating local market conditions about key store variables including sales growth rates gross margin and controllable expenses such as store payroll and occupancy expense as well as asset residual values or lease rates an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 

we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations which requires discounting projected future cash flows this involves making assumptions regarding both a location’s future cash flows as described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows including estimated sales margin and controllable expenses and assumptions about market performance for operating locations and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during 2013 15 operating locations experienced a triggering event and were evaluated for recoverability one of the 15 operating locations was determined to be impaired we recorded impairment losses related to this operating location of 26 million during 2013  compared to impairment losses on operating locations of 55 million during 2012  

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values our actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment losses 

fourteen of the 15 operating locations that experienced a triggering event during 2013  were determined to be recoverable and therefore were not impaired for 11 of these 14 locations the expected undiscounted cash flows substantially exceeded the net book value of the location’s assets for these 11 locations a 10 reduction in projected sales used to estimate future cash flows at the latest date these operating locations were evaluated for impairment would have resulted in the impairment of four of these locations and increased recognized impairment losses by 39 million 

three of the operating locations with a net book value of 25 million had expected undiscounted cash flows that exceeded the net book value of its assets by less than a substantial amount a 10 reduction in projected sales used to estimate future cash flows at the date these operating locations were evaluated for impairment would have resulted in the impairment of these three locations and increased recognized impairment losses by 23 million 

we analyzed other assumptions made in estimating the future cash flows of the operating locations evaluated for impairment but the sensitivity of those assumptions was not significant to the estimates 

store closing lease obligations 

description 

when locations under operating leases are closed we recognize a liability for the fair value of future contractual obligations associated with the leased location the fair value of the store closing lease obligation is determined using an expected present value cash flow model incorporating future minimum lease payments property taxes utilities common area maintenance and other ongoing expenses net of estimated sublease income and other recoverable items discounted at a creditadjusted risk free rate the expected present value cash flow model uses a probability weighted scenario approach that assigns varying cash flows to certain scenarios based on the expected likelihood of outcomes estimating the fair value involves making assumptions regarding estimated sublease income by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated the information includes comparable lease rates of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for leasing these assets subsequent changes to the liability including a change resulting from a revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flows are recognized in the period of the change 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our store closing lease liability calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows primarily related to estimated sublease income and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during 2013  the company relocated two stores subject to operating leases during 2012  one store was relocated we recorded 11 million of expense for store closing lease obligations during both 2013  and 2012  for 2013  these charges included 5 million related to locations closed or relocated during 2013  and 6 million of adjustments related to previously closed or relocated locations 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the expected future cash flows of closed locations under operating leases during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in estimating expected future cash flows our store closing lease obligation losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated losses a 10 change in the store closing lease liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 3 million for 2013  

selfinsurance 

description 

we are selfinsured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation automobile general and product liability extended protection plan and certain medical and dental claims our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable is limited to 2 million per occurrence involving workers’ compensation and 3 million per occurrence involving automobile general or product liability additionally a corridor retention of 2 million per occurrence applies to commercial general liability and product liability claims subject to a 6 million maximum over a threeyear period we do not have any insurance coverage for selfinsured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims selfinsurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for selfinsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during 2013  our selfinsurance liability increased approximately 5 million to 904 million  as of january 31 2014  

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposures including payroll sales and vehicle units as well as the frequency lag and severity of claims 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded selfinsurance liabilities a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 56 million for 2013  a 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately 21 million for 2013  

revenue recognition 

description 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the effects of future events that cannot be determined with certainty 

we sell separatelypriced extended protection plan contracts under a lowe’sbranded program for which the company is ultimately selfinsured the company recognizes revenues from extended protection plan sales on a straightline basis over the respective contract term extended protection plan contract terms primarily range from one to four years from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer’s warranty as applicable the company consistently groups and evaluates extended protection plan contracts based on the characteristics of the underlying products and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected losses a loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected costs of performing services under the contracts exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition costs and related deferred revenue associated with the contracts deferred revenues associated with the extended protection plan contracts increased 15 million to 730 million  as of january 31 2014  

we defer revenue and cost of sales associated with settled transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed revenue is deferred based on the actual amounts received we use historical gross margin rates to estimate the adjustment to cost of sales for these transactions during 2013  deferred revenues associated with these transactions increased 20 million to 461 million as of january 31 2014  

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

for extended protection plans there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected losses as a result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contracts and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contracts there is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of costs of performing services under these contracts 

for the deferral of revenue and cost of sales associated with transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed there is judgment inherent in our estimates of gross margin rates 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contracts during the past three fiscal years we currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract losses on our extended protection plan contracts although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected losses under the extended protection plan contracts it is possible that actual results could differ from our estimates in addition if future evidence indicates that the costs of performing services under these contracts are incurred on other than a straightline basis the timing of revenue recognition under these contracts could change a 10 change in the amount of revenue recognized in 2013  under these contracts would have affected net earnings by approximately 17 million 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to reverse net sales and cost of sales related to amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates related to the impact to cost of sales for these transactions however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may incur additional income or expense a 10 change in the estimate of the gross margin rates applied to these transactions would have affected net earnings by approximately 8 million in 2013  

disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements 

we speak throughout this annual report on form 10k in forwardlooking statements about our future but particularly in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the words “believe” “expect” “will” “should” suggest and other similar expressions are intended to identify those forwardlooking statements while we believe our expectations are reasonable they are not guarantees of future performance our actual results could differ substantially from our expectations 

for a detailed description of the risks and uncertainties that we are exposed to you should read the “risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k to the united states securities and exchange commission all forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this report or in the case of any document incorporated by reference the date of that 

document all subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section and in the “risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forwardlooking statements to reflect events circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and consists of fixedrate instruments therefore providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for financial instruments 

commodity price risk 

we purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control we believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices the selling prices of these commodity products are influenced in part by the market price we pay which is determined by industry supply and demand 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition and results of operations 




 item 9  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure

customers market and competition 

our customers 

we serve homeowners renters and commercial business customers pro customer individual homeowners and renters complete a wide array of projects and vary along the spectrum of doityourself diy and doitforme difm the pro customer consists of two broad categories construction trade and maintenance  repair organizations 

based on our analysis of the market we have identified various types of home improvement customer mindsets our target customer mindset is the “creator” whether they are a homeowner renter or pro customer creators seek quality tailored experiences and are on the lookout for new ideas to improve homes the creator is the most active in the home improvement category in terms of visits and amount of spend we believe that if we focus on the needs of these more discerning customers we will meet or exceed the needs of other customers 

our market 

 

we are among the many businesses including home centers paint stores hardware stores lumber yards and garden centers whose revenues are included in the building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers subsector 444 of the retail trade sector of the north american industry classification system naics the standard used by federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting analyzing and publishing statistical data related to the us business economy the total annual revenue reported for businesses included in naics 444 in 2012 was 294 billion which represented an increase of 54 from the total amount reported in 2011 the total annual revenue reported for businesses included in naics 444 in 2011 was 279 billion which represented an increase of 41 over the amount reported for 2010 

 

  

  

naics 444 represents less than half of what we consider the total market for our products and services the broader market in which lowe’s operates includes homerelated sales through a variety of companies beyond those in naics 444 these include other companies in the retail sector including mass retailers home furnishings stores and online retailers as well as wholesalers that provide homerelated products and services to homeowners businesses and the government based on our analysis of the most recent comprehensive data available we estimate the size of the us home improvement market at 645 billion in 2012 comprised of 499 billion of product sales and 146 billion of installed labor sales 

 

there are many variables that affect consumer demand for the home improvement products and services lowe’s offers key indicators we monitor include real disposable personal income employment home prices housing turnover and home ownership levels we also monitor demographic and societal trends that shape home improvement industry growth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these indicators are important to our business because they impact income available to purchase our products and services or define a key customer base for home maintenance repair and upgrade projects currently these indicators suggest moderately improving consumer demand for the home improvement products and services we sell however in this uncertain economic environment we continue to balance implementation of our longterm growth plans with our nearterm focus on improving performance and maintaining adequate liquidity 

our competition 

the home improvement retailing business includes many competitors we compete with other home improvement warehouse chains and lumberyards in most of our trade areas we also compete with traditional hardware plumbing electrical and home supply retailers in addition we compete with respect to some of our products with general merchandise retailers mail order firms warehouse clubs online and other specialty retailers our customers value reputation customer experience quality and price of merchandise and range and availability of products and services location of stores also continues to be a key competitive factor in our industry however the increasing use of technology and the simplicity of online shopping also underline the importance of multichannel presence as a competitive factor see further discussion of competition in item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a  risk factors 

we have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys external research planning processes risk mapping analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational financial environmental reputational strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business for more information about our risk management process which is administered by our chief risk officer and includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify see the description included in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders as defined in item 10 of part iii of this annual report on form 10k under “board’s role in the risk management process” 

  

  

we describe below all known material risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or business prospects these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended supplemented or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in our future periodic reports on form 10k form 10q and reports on other forms we file with the securities and exchange commission all forwardlooking statements about our future results of operations or other matters made by us in this annual report on form 10k in our annual report to lowe’s shareholders and in our subsequently filed reports to the securities and exchange commission as well as in our press releases and other public communications are qualified by the risks described below 

  

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy 

general economic factors and other conditions both domestically and internationally may adversely affect the us economy the global economy and our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of slow economic growth or recession volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of borrowing to lowe’s and its customers the “sequester” and related governmental spending and budget matters slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income sustained high rates of unemployment high consumer debt levels increasing fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters acts of terrorism and developments in the war against terrorism in asia the middle east and other parts of the world the continuing sluggish pace of the recovery from the deep global recession could continue to have an adverse effect on the rate of growth of discretionary spending by consumers and the share of such discretionary spending on home improvement products and services 

  

adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales 

sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects slowly recovering home prices the large number of households that continue to have little or negative equity slowly declining mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing slower household formation growth rates and lower housing turnover through existing home sales have limited and may continue to limit consumers’ discretionary spending particularly on larger home improvement projects that are important to our business 

changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could adversely affect our business 

laws and regulations at the local regional state federal and international levels change frequently and the changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation that affect employmentlabor trade product safety transportationlogistics energy costs health care cybersecurity tax or environmental issues could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations changes in enforcement priorities by governmental agencies charged with enforcing existing laws and regulations can increase our cost of doing business in addition we are subject to various procurement regulations applicable to our contracts for sales to the us government and could be adversely affected by changes in those regulations or any negative findings from an audit or investigation 

we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the competitive environment in which we operate is particularly challenging during periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment with heavy promotions particularly of discretionary items the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores customer service quality and price of merchandise and services instock levels and merchandise assortment and presentation our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our expected results 

  

  

our inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate ourselves from competitors 

part of our strategy includes continued differentiation from competitors to better distinguish our product offering we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national brand names the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial results 

  

operating internationally presents unique challenges that have required us to adapt our store operations merchandising marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada and mexico and to work effectively with our joint venture partner in australia 

a significant portion of our anticipated store growth over the next five years will be in canada and mexico we are also in a joint venture with australia’s largest retailer woolworths limited to develop a network of home improvement stores for consumers in australia expanding internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks and slow the anticipated rate of such expansion 

if the domestic or international supply chain for our products is disrupted our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted 

we source stock and sell products from over 7000 domestic and international vendors we source a large number of those products from foreign manufacturers with china being the largest source financial instability among key vendors political instability or labor unrest in source countries retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the united states or a major source country tariffs currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs 

  

if we are unable to secure or develop and implement sufficiently robust new technologies to deliver business process solutions within the appropriate time frame cost and functionality our strategic initiatives that are dependent upon these technologies may not be successful 

the success of our strategic initiatives designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers’ expenditures on home improvement projects is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the new business initiatives we are developing now and will be developing in the future would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

  

we may not be able to achieve the objectives of the strategic initiatives we have underway if our organization is unable to make the transformational changes we are undertaking in our business model 

we are adapting our business model to meet our customers’ changing expectations that we will not only sell them the products and services they need and want but also deliver using new tools skills and processes a full service experience by being a part of their home improvement projects from start to finish our strategies require transformational changes to our business model and will require new competencies in some positions and our employees and independent contractors such as thirdparty installers and repair technicians will not only have to understand nontraditional selling platforms but also commit to fundamental changes in lowe’s culture and the processes through which they have traditionally interacted with customers to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes our strategic initiatives designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers’ expenditures on home improvement projects may not be as successful as we expect them to be the many challenges our management faces in effectively managing our business as we adapt our business model also increase the risk that we may not achieve our objectives 

our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 

an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies cost reductions and sales and cash flow growth is the maintenance and ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as inventory replenishment merchandise ordering transportation receipt processing and product delivery our financial 

  

  

performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to maintain improve upgrade and expand our systems 

  

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our multichannel sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

access to the internet from computers smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them our website lowescom is a sales channel for our products and is also a method of making product project and other relevant information available to them that influences our instore sales in addition to lowescom we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire inform crosssell establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service or other cyberattacks or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of lowe’s as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services 

  

our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer employee or vendor data or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems and assets and such data from the threat of cyberattacks 

cyberattacks designed to gain access to sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving and high profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized release of confidential information have occurred recently at a number of major us companies despite widespread recognition of the cyberattack threat and improved data protection methods while we have invested in the protection of our information technology and maintain what we believe are adequate security procedures and controls over financial and other individually identifiable customer employee and vendor data provided to us a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could nonetheless occur and have a material adverse effect on our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability including for possible punitive damages an electronic security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of sensitive data from our information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks in addition as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other company’s obligation to protect such sensitive data becomes stricter a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits 

if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists or contract with qualified installers and repair technicians with expanded skill sets who can work effectively and collaboratively in an increasingly culturally diverse environment we could lose sales to our competitors 

our customers whether they are homeowners or commercial businesses expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide our customers also expect the independent contractors who install products they purchase from us to perform the installation in a timely and capable manner increasingly our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets including in some instances the ability to do inhome or telephone sales in addition in many of our stores our employees and thirdparty contractors must be able to serve customers whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own also as our employees become increasingly culturally diverse our managers and sales associates must be able to manage and work collaboratively with employees whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own   

  

failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

no single vendor of the products we sell accounts for more than 7 of our total purchases but we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business if these vendors 

  

  

  

or service providers fail or are unable to perform as expected and we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to do so and potentially in some cases permanently 

  

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales profitability cash flows and financial condition 

product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe’s and the company’s brand image as a result lowe’s reputation as a retailer of high quality products and services including both national and lowe’s private brands could suffer and impact customer loyalty additionally a decline in product and service quality could result in product recalls product liability and warranty claims 

future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and in the future will become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved individually or collectively is considered material

executive overview 

during 2012 we made progress on our key initiatives continuing our journey to become the customer’s first choice in home improvement the economic environment showed signs of improvement as fiscal 2012 represented the first year of growth across all of the core housing metrics housing turnover singlefamily starts and median home prices these recent positive trends helped consumers regain confidence in both the local housing markets and their home values consequently we were able to deliver solid results for the year net earnings for 2012 increased 65 to 20 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 182 to 169 net sales for 2012 increased 06 to 505 billion fiscal 2011 contained an extra week which contributed 766 million to 2011 net sales or 005 to diluted earnings per share comparable sales were 14 driven by a 09 increase in comparable average ticket and a 05 increase in comparable transactions 

for 2012 cash flows from operating activities were approximately 38 billion with 12 billion used for capital expenditures our strong financial position and positive cash flows provided us with the ability to make strategic investments in our core business and to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases during fiscal 2012 we paid 704 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 146 million shares of common stock for a total of 435 billion under our share repurchase program 

continuing our journey 

in 2012 we continued to deliver on our commitment to retail excellence by building on our core strengths while developing capabilities to provide seamless support across channels and a simplified home improvement experience 

to further deliver a seamless and simple experience we continued to upgrade our it infrastructure and gave customers and associates greater access to information and products through enhanced mobile technology mylowes and flexible fulfillment in 2012 we made additional improvements to our associates’ iphone ® capabilities to enable them to deliver better customer experiences in the aisle by giving them immediate access to the information they need such as the ability to identify available rebates our mylowes customer base also continues to grow since the launch of mylowes in late 

  

  

2011 there have been over 18 million unique key fob swipes and over 5 million cardholders have registered their cards on mylowes we also experienced strong customer response to our iphone ® and android tm mobile applications which have grown to represent approximately 20 of overall lowescom traffic in addition flexible fulfillment now allows us to deliver instock lowescom parcel orders to customers in over 90 of us markets within 24 hours at standard shipping rates 

as we redefine our business to become more seamless and simple we must also continue to protect retail relevance in 2012 our focus was on two key initiatives value improvement and product differentiation value improvement is designed to enhance our ability to offer compelling products and value while product differentiation is designed to help us drive excitement and flexibility in our stores by highlighting innovative products through better display techniques these strategic initiatives build on lowe’s core strengths and are expected to deliver comparable transaction growth better gross margins and greater inventory productivity by localizing assortments and driving excitement in our stores 

value improvement enhances our ability to offer compelling products and value by having the right product at the right quantity at the right place at the right time in 2012 we leveraged our integrated planning and execution tool to create clusters of stores based on specific differences and customer buying preferences which enhanced the assortment strategy that was used to guide the line review process for each cluster the product assortments were designed to reduce duplication of features and functions within price points to improve the customer experience we are also working to reduce unit costs by negotiating lower first costs from vendors by eliminating funds set aside for promotional and marketing support the result is a more localized assortment of products and simpler price point progression within the category as skus are rationalized the teams are reinvesting the inventory dollars in greater depth of high volume skus in addition we are increasing our instock targets for these new lines to ensure items are available when needed by customers by the end of 2012 we completed product line reviews and product line resets of approximately 80 and 30 of our business respectively 

through our product differentiation initiative we revised many of our endcap locations to highlight innovative products significant values or to showcase specific private or national brands in addition we redesigned promotional spaces to better promote seasonally relevant high value items to drive sales and to provide more open sight lines to navigate and shop at our stores during 2012 our product differentiation resets were rolled out to approximately 1250 stores and we expect to roll the resets out to an additional 160 stores in 2013 

in conjunction with our progress on value improvement and product differentiation in 2012 we also initiated sales training programs for store and contact center employees to further develop our sales culture and pave the way for the next phase of our transformation 

where we go from here – 2013 and beyond 

while the housing market is slowly improving consumers are still coping with the lingering effects of the recession as mortgage delinquency rates remain at historic highs while we are optimistic about a housing recovery and nearterm personal consumption expenditures are expected to grow faster than personal income employment and income are expected to continue to grow slowly consumers will need to continue to prioritize how and where they spend their discretionary income and therefore our outlook for 2013 assumes modest growth in the home improvement market however we have confidence in our vision and have laid the foundation to continue improving our core business as we move into fiscal year 2013 

in 2013 our value improvement initiative will remain the primary focus of the organization as we improve our product offerings by localizing assortments we expect to drive improved close rates we also have an opportunity to improve close rates through additional labor in our stores we expect to add approximately 150 hours per store per week to the staffing model for nearly twothirds of our stores to help reduce the gap between our weekend versus weekday close rate our goal is to better serve customers and close more sales during peak weekday hours by increasing assistance available in the aisles we believe the increased labor hours and higher instock service levels will help us further capitalize on traffic during the week which will result in an improvement in close rates 

  

  

in 2013 and beyond we will further develop our flexible fulfillment capability by deploying central dispatch cdo and central production offices cpo the cdo will allow for centralized delivery scheduling and better route planning resulting in lower fuel cost greater fleet utilization and more productive overall delivery the cpo will provide operational efficiencies through the consolidation of labor today each store has its own installed sales office whereas in the future that labor will be consolidated into our contact centers resulting in a significant reduction of labor hours the customer’s experience will be enhanced through better coordination and consistency 

we will also build trust by partnering with customers to recommend solutions that fit their needs and to help them make the right decisions based on their individual home improvement goals beyond 2013 we will further enhance our sales culture by providing our associates the ability to sell seamlessly across channels and to introduce improved project management tools that expand fulfillment capabilities to cultivate personal and simple connections with customers associates across selling channels will be provided with a singleview of the customer one record per customer from lead capture to project completion these changes will enable us to improve close rates and capitalize on the momentum of the improving economy and increases in consumer discretionary spending 

by building on core strengths we have laid the foundation to deliver on our commitment to retail excellence and will continue to focus on developing the capabilities to provide our customers a seamless and simple home improvement experience going forward

1 fiscal year ended 2011 had 53 weeks fiscal years 2012 and 2010 had 52 weeks 

2 ebit margin also referred to as operating margin is defined as earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales 

3 a comparable location is defined as a location that has been open longer than 13 months   a location that is identified for relocation is no longer considered comparable one month prior to its relocation the relocated location must then remain open longer than 13 months to be considered comparable a location we have decided to close is no longer considered comparable as of the beginning of the month in which we announce its closing 

  4 comparable sales are based on comparable 52week periods for 2012 and 2010 and comparable 53week periods for 2011 

5 average ticket is defined as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions 

6 average store size selling square feet is defined as sales floor square feet divided by the number of stores open at the end of the period 

7 return on average assets is defined as net earnings divided by average total assets for the last five quarters 

8 return on average shareholders’ equity is defined as net earnings divided by average shareholders’ equity for the last five quarters 

9 return on invested capital is a nongaap financial measure see below for additional information 

return on invested capital 

return on invested capital roic is considered a nongaap financial measure we believe roic is a meaningful metric for investors because it measures how effectively the company uses capital to generate profits 

we define roic as trailing four quarters’ net operating profit after tax divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters although roic is a common financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating roic accordingly the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roic we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roic before comparing its roic to ours 

we consider return on average debt and equity to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to roic the difference between these two measures is that roic adjusts net earnings to exclude tax adjusted interest expense 

  

  

the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation to the calculation of return on average debt and equity the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows 

 

1 income tax adjustment is defined as earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by the effective tax rate 

2 average debt and equity is defined as average debt including current maturities and shortterm borrowings plus total equity for the last five quarters 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

for the purpose of the following discussion comparable sales comparable average ticket and comparable customer transactions are based on comparable 52week periods 

net sales – net sales increased 06 to 505 billion in 2012 the additional week in 2011 and resulting week shift in 2012 negatively impacted sales comparisons by 692 million or 14 comparable sales increased 14 in 2012 driven by a 09 increase in comparable average ticket and a 05 increase in comparable customer transactions our key initiatives value improvement and product differentiation drove 40 basis points of the increase in sales in addition our proprietary credit value proposition which offers customers the choice of 5 off every day or promotional financing contributed 65 basis points to the increase in sales geographically all operating divisions in the us delivered positive comparable sales for the year as sales performance was well balanced in 2012 furthermore we continued to see strength in our pro services business which outperformed the company average 

we experienced comparable sales above the company average in the following product categories during 2012 lumber tools  outdoor power equipment paint seasonal living cabinets  countertops and home fashions storage  cleaning in addition fashion electrical hardware flooring and plumbing performed at approximately the overall company average inflation aided comparable sales throughout the year in both the lumber and paint categories 

  

  

comparable sales for paint also benefited from new product offerings hurricane sandy also contributed to comparable sale increases for lumber as a result of storm response efforts and for tools  outdoor power equipment due to increased generator sales in addition tools  outdoor power equipment comparable sales were also positively impacted by favorable weather in the first half of the year combined with effective promotions 

comparable sales were below the company average in building materials millwork appliances and lawn  garden the timing of storm recovery and repair efforts in 2012 as compared to 2011 resulted in decreased comparable sales in building materials in addition difficult comparisons to prior year promotional activity led to decreased comparable sales in millwork and appliances lawn  garden was impacted by extreme heat and drought conditions in the first half of the year slightly offset by improved inventory planning and attachment rates in the second half of the year 

gross margin – gross margin of 343 for 2012 represented a 26 basis point decrease from 2011 primarily driven by an unfavorable 19 basis point impact related to our proprietary credit value proposition in addition we experienced a seven basis point unfavorable impact to margin related to pricing and promotional activity 

sga – the 84 basis point decrease in sga expense as a percentage of sales from 2011 to 2012 was primarily driven by 81 basis points of leverage due to longlived asset impairment and other costs associated with the 27 store closures and discontinued projects in 2011 we also experienced approximately 35 basis points of leverage associated with our proprietary credit program which was driven by increased portfolio income as a result of continued growth in the program these were partially offset by deleverage of approximately 15 basis points associated with incentive compensation due to higher attainment levels compared to targets for storebased employees relative to last year in addition we experienced nine basis points of deleverage in contract labor associated with information technology projects to improve customer experiences 

depreciation – depreciation expense deleveraged six basis points for 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher depreciation associated with it capital investments made to improve customer experiences which have shorter average useful lives property less accumulated depreciation decreased to 215 billion at february 1 2013 compared to 220 billion at february 3 2012 at february 1 2013 and february 3 2012 we owned 89 of our stores which included stores on leased land 

interest – net – net interest expense is comprised of the following 

 

net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of 10 billion and 20 billion of unsecured notes in november 2011 and april 2012 respectively partially offset by favorable tax settlements that resulted in a reduced interest accrual during 2012 

income tax provision – our   effective income tax rate was 376 in 2012 compared to 367 in 2011 the lower effective tax rate in 2011 was the result of the recognition of onetime federal employee retention benefits from the federal hire hiring incentives to restore employment retention tax credit as well as the favorable settlement of certain state tax matters in the third quarter of 2011 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

for the purpose of the following discussion comparable sales comparable average ticket and comparable customer transactions are based on comparable 53week periods 

  

  

net sales – net sales increased 29 to 502 billion in 2011 while comparable sales were flat the additional week in 2011 contributed 16 to the increase in net sales comparable customer transactions increased approximately 04 and comparable average ticket decreased 04 versus 2010 

while comparable sales were flat in 2011 we saw sequential improvement each quarter with comparable sales of negative 33 in the first quarter negative 03 in the second quarter positive 07 in the third quarter and positive 34 in the fourth quarter unseasonably cold wet weather severe storms and flooding during the first quarter as well as comparisons to the 2010 cash for appliances government incentive program led to lower performance during the first half of the year however as comparisons to the cash for appliances program eased and storm recovery efforts were underway we saw improvement in comparable sales in addition strong customer response to our 5 off everyday offer to lowe’s credit cardholders launched in the first half of 2011 aided comparable sales for the balance of the year 

we experienced comparable sales above the company average in the following product categories during 2011 building materials fashion electrical paint hardware plumbing and tools  outdoor power equipment in addition seasonal living home fashions storage  cleaning flooring lawn  garden and lumber performed at approximately the overall company average although unfavorable weather in the early part of the year negatively impacted outdoor categories such as building materials recovery efforts after severe spring storms that hit many regions of the country and hurricane irene positively impacted comparable sales in building materials with particularly strong sales of roofing products and installation services plumbing also benefited from the wet weather and storm recovery efforts with strong sales of pumps  tanks and dehumidifiers in addition tools  outdoor power equipment experienced favorable comparable sales primarily driven by holiday promotions and strong customer response to new products such as our new line of kobalt mechanics tools fashion electrical also performed above the company average during 2011 driven by increased customer demand for energysaving light bulbs outdoor lighting and electrical cable 

however difficult comparisons to prior year energy tax credits negatively impacted comparable sales in millwork in addition while we experienced strong market share gains in cabinets  countertops they were not enough to offset the impact of the contracting market leading to comparable sales below the company average for the year appliances also experienced negative comparable sales for the year driven by comparisons to the prior year cash for appliances program which primarily impacted the first half of the year 

gross margin – gross margin of 3456 for 2011 represented a 58 basis point decrease from 2010 primarily driven by margin rate strong customer response to our 5 off everyday offer to lowe’s credit cardholders targeted promotional activity and pricing changes associated with our move to everyday low prices negatively impacted margin for the year margin was also negatively impacted by 19 basis points associated with distribution expenses primarily related to higher fuel costs in addition lower of cost or market inventory adjustments primarily related to the 27 stores that closed in the second half of the year negatively impacted margin by six basis points these were partially offset by 15 basis points of favorable impact associated with the mix of products sold across product categories 

sga – the increase in sga expense as a percentage of sales from 2010 to 2011 was primarily driven by deleverage of 83 basis points related to charges for store closings discontinued projects and longlived asset impairments we also experienced approximately 15 basis points of deleverage related to investments made to improve customer experiences including expenses associated with additional internal and external staffing and technology expenditures in addition we experienced deleverage in payroll taxes and fleet expense these increases were partially offset by leverage of approximately 40 basis points associated with our proprietary credit program due to reduced program costs associated with lower losses and lower promotional financing as more customers took advantage of the 5 off every day offer in addition bonus expense leveraged 30 basis points due to lower attainment levels for the year relative to plan 

depreciation – depreciation expense leveraged 30 basis points for 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a lower asset base resulting from decreased capital spending and assets becoming fully depreciated or impaired property less accumulated depreciation decreased to 220 billion at february 3 2012 compared to 221 billion at january 28 2011 at february 3 2012 and january 28 2011 we owned 89 of our stores which included stores on leased land 

  

  

interest – net interest expense is comprised of the following 

 

net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of 20 billion of notes during 2010 and 10 billion of notes during 2011 offset by the repayment of 500 million of notes during 2010 

income tax provision – our   effective income tax rate was 367 in 2011 compared to 377 in 2010 the reduction in the effective tax rate was predominantly due to the recognition of benefits from the federal hire hiring incentives to restore employment retention tax credit as well as various state tax credit programs 

lowe’s business outlook 

as of february 25 2013 the date of our fourth quarter 2012 earnings release we expected total sales in 2013 to increase approximately 4 and comparable sales to increase approximately 35 we expected to open approximately 10 stores during 2013 in addition earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales operating margin were expected to increase approximately 60 basis points and the effective tax rate was expected to be approximately 381 diluted earnings per share of 205 were expected for the fiscal year ending january 31 2014 our guidance assumed approximately 4 billion in share repurchases during 2013 spread evenly across the four quarters 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2012 versus 2011 was primarily driven by changes in working capital the change in working capital was primarily driven by the timing of tax payments during the periods the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for 2012 versus 2011 was primarily driven by a decrease in capital expenditures in addition to an increase in proceeds received from the sale of property and other longterm assets partially offset by lower proceeds from the salematurity of investments the increase in net cash used in financing activities for 2012 was primarily driven by an increase in cash used to repurchase shares which included shares repurchased under our share repurchase program and shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities upon vesting of restricted stock awards this was partially offset by the net change in longterm debt and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock due to options exercised 

sources of liquidity 

in addition to our cash flows from operations liquidity is provided by our shortterm borrowing facilities we have a 175 billion senior credit facility that expires in october 2016 the senior credit facility supports our commercial paper program and has a 500 million letter of credit sublimit letters of credit issued pursuant to the senior credit facility reduce the amount available for borrowing under its terms borrowings made are unsecured and are priced at fixed rates based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the senior credit facility the senior credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants which include maintenance of a debt leverage ratio as defined by the senior credit facility we were in compliance with those covenants at february 1 2013 thirteen banking institutions are participating in the senior credit facility there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the senior credit facility and no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program at february 1 2013 

 

  

  

we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both shortterm and longterm bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new longterm debt the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected however by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard  poor’s sp and moody’s as of april 1 2013 which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds although we currently do not expect a downgrade in our debt ratings our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

 

we believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate not only for our operating requirements but also for investments in information technology investments in our existing stores expansion plans and acquisitions if any and to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases over the next 12 months there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price in addition we do not have a significant amount of cash held in foreign affiliates that would not be available to fund domestic operations 

cash requirements 

capital expenditures 

our fiscal 2013 capital budget is approximately 125 billion inclusive of approximately 50 million of lease commitments resulting in a planned net cash outflow of 12 billion approximately 40 of the planned net cash outflow is for investments to enhance the customer experience including enhancements in information technology investments in our existing stores are expected to account for approximately 35 of net cash outflow including investments in store equipment resets and remerchandising our expansion plans for 2013 consist of approximately 10 new stores all of which are expected to be owned and which will account for approximately 15 of the planned net cash outflow approximately 30 of these new stores are expected to be on leased land other planned capital expenditures accounting for 10 of planned net cash outflow are for investments in our distribution network including one additional regional distribution center 

debt and capital 

in april 2012 we issued 20 billion of unsecured notes in three tranches 500 million of 1625 notes maturing in april 2017 750 million of 312 notes maturing in april 2022 and 750 million of 465 notes maturing in april 2042 net proceeds from the 2017 2022 and 2042 notes were approximately 498 million 746 million and 740 million respectively 

during 2012 550 million of unsecured debt matured and was repaid with cash from operations and investing activities 

dividends declared during fiscal 2012 totaled 708 million our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of 2012 was paid in fiscal 2013 and totaled 178 million 

we have an ongoing share repurchase program that is executed through purchases made from time to time in the open market or through private offmarket transactions shares purchased under the share repurchase program are returned to authorized and unissued status on february 1 2013 the company’s board of directors authorized an additional 50 billion of share repurchases with no expiration simultaneously terminating the remaining previous balance of 150 million under the prior authorization this share repurchase authorization is expected to be used by the end of fiscal 2014 

our ratio of debt to equity plus debt was 396 and 316 as of february 1 2013 and february 3 2012 respectively 

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at february 1 2013 

 

1   amounts do not include taxes common area maintenance insurance or contingent rent because these amounts have historically been insignificant 

2 represents commitments related to certain marketing and information technology programs and purchases of merchandise inventory 

3 letters of credit are issued primarily for insurance and construction contracts 

at february 1 2013 our reserve for uncertain tax positions including penalties and interest was 75 million of which 11 million was classified as a current liability and 64 million was classified as a noncurrent liability at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this form 10k requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

merchandise inventory 

description 

we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels sales trends and historical experience during 2012 our reserve increased approximately 10 million to 57 million as of february 1 2013 

we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories during 2012 the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately 1 million to 142 million as of february 1 2013 

in addition we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business principally as a result of purchase volumes sales early payments or promotions of vendors’ products generally these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor’s product therefore we treat these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors’ products are recorded as an offset to the related expense 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions however changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves likewise changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and results of physical inventories we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of nonproductive inventory and assumptions about net realizable value 

for vendor funds we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves however it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves a 10 change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 3 million for 2012 a 10 change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 9 million for 2012 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective longterm estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 

  

  

longlived asset impairment 

description 

we review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable when evaluating locations for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead 

we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to longlived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location’s asset carrying values may not be recoverable for operating locations our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a 12month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment including individual locations’ execution of their operating plans and local market conditions including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe’s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location’s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location management makes assumptions incorporating local market conditions about key store variables including sales growth rates gross margin and controllable expenses such as store payroll and occupancy expense as well as asset residual values or lease rates an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 

we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations which requires discounting projected future cash flows this involves making assumptions regarding both a location’s future cash flows as described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours 

we use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for closure this involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated the information includes comparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these assets 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows including estimated sales margin and controllable expenses and assumptions about market performance for operating locations and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during 2012 12 operating locations experienced a triggering event and were evaluated for recoverability five of the 12 operating locations were determined to be impaired we recorded impairment losses related to these five operating locations of 55 million during 2012 compared to impairment losses on operating locations and locations identified for closure of 309 million during 2011 

  

  

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values our actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment losses 

seven of the 12 operating locations that experienced a triggering event during 2012 were determined to be recoverable and therefore were not impaired for these seven locations the expected undiscounted cash flows substantially exceeded the net book value of the location’s assets a 10 reduction in projected sales used to estimate future cash flows at the latest date that these seven operating locations were evaluated for impairment would have resulted in the impairment of four of these locations and increased recognized impairment losses by approximately 47 million 

we analyzed other assumptions made in estimating the future cash flows of the operating locations evaluated for impairment but the sensitivity of those assumptions was not significant to the estimates 

store closing lease obligations 

description 

when locations under operating leases are closed we recognize a liability for the fair value of future contractual obligations associated with the leased location the fair value of the store closing lease obligation is determined using an expected present value cash flow model incorporating future minimum lease payments property taxes utilities common area maintenance and other ongoing expenses net of estimated sublease income and other recoverable items discounted at a creditadjusted risk free rate the expected present value cash flow model uses a probability weighted scenario approach that assigns varying cash flows to certain scenarios based on the expected likelihood of outcomes estimating the fair value involves making assumptions regarding estimated sublease income by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated the information includes comparable lease rates of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for leasing these assets subsequent changes to the liability including a change resulting from a revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flows are recognized in the period of the change 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our store closing lease liability calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows primarily related to estimated sublease income and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during 2012 the company relocated one store subject to an operating lease during 2011 13 stores under operating lease were closed which includes one store that was relocated we recorded 11 million and 76 million of expense for store closing lease obligations during 2012 and 2011 respectively for 2012 these charges included 9 million related to locations closed or relocated during 2012 and 2 million of adjustments related to previously closed or relocated locations 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the expected future cash flows of closed locations under operating leases during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in estimating expected future cash flows our store closing lease obligation losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated losses a 10 change in the store closing lease liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 5 million for 2012 

selfinsurance 

description 

we are selfinsured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation automobile general and product liability  extended protection plan and certain medical and dental claims our selfinsured retention or deductible as applicable is limited to 2 million per occurrence involving workers’ compensation and 3 million per occurrence involving 

  

  

automobile general or product liability additionally a corridor retention of 2 million per occurrence applies to commercial general liability and product liability claims subject to a 6 million maximum over a threeyear period we do not have any stop loss limits for selfinsured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims selfinsurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for selfinsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during 2012 our selfinsurance liability increased approximately 35 million to 899 million as of february 1 2013 during 2012 we reduced the discount rate applied to selfinsurance claims by 100 basis points which resulted in a 20 million unfavorable impact to net earnings 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposures including payroll sales and vehicle units as well as the frequency lag and severity of claims 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded selfinsurance liabilities a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 56 million for 2012 a 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately 23 million for 2012 

revenue recognition 

description 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the effects of future events that cannot be determined with certainty 

we sell separatelypriced extended protection plan contracts under a lowe’sbranded program for which the company is ultimately selfinsured the company recognizes revenues from extended protection plan sales on a straightline basis over the respective contract term extended protection plan contract terms primarily range from one to four years from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer’s warranty as applicable the company consistently groups and evaluates extended protection plan contracts based on the characteristics of the underlying products and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected losses a loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected costs of performing services under the contracts exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition costs and related deferred revenue associated with the contracts deferred revenues associated with the extended protection plan contracts increased 11 million to 715 million as of february 1 2013 

we defer revenue and cost of sales associated with settled transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed revenue is deferred based on the actual amounts received we use historical gross margin rates to estimate the adjustment to cost of sales for these transactions during 2012 deferred revenues associated with these transactions increased 11 million to 441 million as of february 1 2013 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

for extended protection plans there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected losses as a result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contracts and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contracts there is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of costs of performing services under these contracts 

for the deferral of revenue and cost of sales associated with transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed there is judgment inherent in our estimates of gross margin rates 

  

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contracts during the past three fiscal years we currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract losses on our extended protection plan contracts although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected losses under the extended protection plan contracts it is possible that actual results could differ from our estimates in addition if future evidence indicates that the costs of performing services under these contracts are incurred on other than a straightline basis the timing of revenue recognition under these contracts could change a 10 change in the amount of revenue recognized in 2012 under these contracts would have affected net earnings by approximately 15 million 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to reverse net sales and cost of sales related to amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates related to the impact to cost of sales for these transactions however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may incur additional income or expense a 10 change in the estimate of the gross margin rates applied to these transactions would have affected net earnings by approximately 7 million in 2012

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and consists of fixedrate instruments therefore providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for financial instruments 

commodity price risk 

we purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control we believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices the selling prices of these commodity products are influenced in part by the market price we pay which is determined by industry supply and demand 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition and results of operations

our customers 

we serve homeowners renters and commercial business customers individual homeowners and renters complete a wide array of projects and vary along the spectrum of doityourself diy and doitforme difm commercial business customers include those who work in construction repairremodel commercial and residential property management or business maintenance professions 

based on our analysis of the market we have identified various types of home improvement customers our target customer is the “creator” whether they are a homeowner renter or commercial business customer the creator is the most active in the home improvement category in terms of visits and amount of spend creators seek quality tailored experiences and are on the lookout for new ideas to improve homes we believe that if we focus on the needs of these more discerning customers we will meet or exceed the needs of other customers 

  

  

our market 

 

we are among the many businesses including home centers paint stores hardware stores lumber yards and garden centers whose revenues are included in the building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers subsector 444 of the retail trade sector of the north american industry classification system naics the standard used by federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting analyzing and publishing statistical data related to the us business economy the total annual revenue reported for businesses included in naics subsector 444 in 2011 was 300 billion which represented an increase of 57 from the total amount reported in 2010 the total annual revenue reported for businesses included in naics subsector 444 in 2010 was 284 billion which represented an increase of 59 over the amount reported for 2009 naics subsector 444 represents approximately half of what we consider the total market for our products and services 

 

there are many variables that impact consumer demand for the home improvement products and services we offer key indicators we monitor include employment home prices real disposable personal income housing turnover and home ownership levels we also monitor demographic and societal trends that are indicators of home improvement industry growth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these indicators are important to our business because they impact income available to purchase our products and services or otherwise provide an established customer base for home maintenance and repair projects currently these indicators suggest moderately improving consumer demand for the home improvement products and services we sell however in this uncertain economic environment we continue to balance implementation of our longterm growth plans with our nearterm focus on improving performance and maintaining adequate liquidity 

our competition 

the home improvement retailing business includes many competitors we compete with other home improvement warehouse chains and lumberyards in most of our trade areas we also compete with traditional hardware plumbing electrical and home supply retailers in addition we compete with respect to some of our products with general merchandise retailers mail order firms warehouse clubs online and other specialty retailers our target customers value 

  

  

reputation customer experience quality and price of merchandise and range and availability of products and services location of stores also continues to be a key competitive factor in our industry however the increasing use of technology and the simplicity of online shopping also underline the importance of multichannel presence as a competitive factor see further discussion of competition in item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k

we source our products from over 7000 vendors worldwide with no single vendor accounting for more than 7 of total purchases we believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all of our products whenever possible we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for customers and improve our gross margin 

to efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain instock levels we own and operate 14 highlyautomated regional distribution centers rdcs in the united states with a fifteenth rdc under construction on average each domestic rdc serves approximately 120 stores in addition we lease and operate a distribution facility to serve our canadian stores 

  

  

we also operate 15 flatbed distribution centers to distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber boards panel products irrigation pipe vinyl siding ladders and building materials additionally we operate four facilities to support our import business and flexible fulfillment capabilities we also utilize three thirdparty transload facilities which are the first point of receipt for imported products the transload facilities sort and allocate products to rdcs based on individual store demand and forecasts

the retail business in general is subject to seasonal influences and our business is to some extent seasonal historically we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter may june and july and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter november december and january accordingly our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes we fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations but also with shortterm borrowings as needed for more detailed information see the financial condition liquidity and capital resources section in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k 

intellectual property

our role in helping consumers with their conservation was recognized by the us environmental protection agency epa with our second consecutive energy star sustained excellence award in retail 20102011 which recognizes our longstanding leadership as a retailer of energyefficient products as well as nine consecutive energy star awards 20032011 including four energy star partner of the year awards for educating consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency we were also recognized by the epa watersense program with our third consecutive retail partner of the year award 

lowe’s also recognizes how efficient operations can help protect the environment and our bottom line we examine our own operations to deliver efficiencies in energy use water consumption and waste  recycling we annually track our carbon footprint and participate in the carbon disclosure project an independent notforprofit organization holding the largest database of primary corporate climate change information in the world in an effort to mitigate the impact of our energy use we also purchase renewable energy certificates rec equal to 3 of our energy use and are recognized as the sixth largest retail purchaser of green power in the epa’s green power partnership program to further reduce our footprint we design energyefficient features into new stores and during retrofits of existing stores these features include energy efficient lighting white membrane cool roofs and hvac units that meet or exceed energy star qualifications 

we also strive to get products to our stores in an environmentally responsible manner we achieve that through involvement in the smartway® transport partnership an innovative program launched by the us epa in 2004 that promotes environmentally cleaner more fuel efficient transportation options our latest recognition came in 2011 when we earned the 2011 smartway team champion this award was based on initiatives that resulted in reduced carbon dioxide emissions and less overall highway congestion these included increasing shipping by rail increasing efficiency of truckload shipments allowing more products to be shipped on fewer trailers and continuing to use a higher percentage of smartway carriers

compliance with environmental matters 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment they have in the past and may in the future increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways including indirectly through increased energy costs as producers of energy and petroleum and potentially other major emitters of greenhouse gases are subjected to increased or new regulation or legislation that results in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2012 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with such laws or regulations

 item 1a  risk factors 

we have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys external research risk mapping analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational financial environmental reputational strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business for more information about our risk management process which is administered by our chief risk officer and includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify see the description included in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders as defined in item 10 of part iii of this annual report on form 10k under “board’s role in the risk management process” 

 

we describe below all known material risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or business prospects these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended supplemented or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in our future periodic reports on form 10k form 10q and reports on other forms we file with the securities and exchange commission all forwardlooking statements about our future results of operations or other matters made by us in this annual report on form 10k in our annual report to lowe’s shareholders and in our subsequently filed reports to the securities and exchange commission as well as in our press releases and other public communications are qualified by the risks described below 

 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy 

general economic factors and other conditions both domestically and internationally may adversely affect the us economy the global economy and our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of slow economic growth or recession volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of borrowing to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income sustained high rates of unemployment high consumer debt levels increasing fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters acts of terrorism and developments in the war against terrorism in asia the middle east and other parts of the world 

 

adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable store sales 

sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects steep declines in recent years’ home prices the increasing number of households with little or negative equity high mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates the reduction in the availability of mortgage financing slower household formation growth rates and lower housing turnover through existing home sales have limited and may continue to limit consumers’ discretionary spending particularly on larger home improvement projects that are important to our business 

  

  

changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could adversely affect our business 

laws and regulations at the local regional state federal and international levels change frequently and the changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation that affect employmentlabor trade product safety transportationlogistics energy costs health care tax or environmental issues could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations changes in enforcement priorities by governmental agencies charged with enforcing existing laws and regulations can increase our cost of doing business in addition we are subject to various procurement regulations applicable to our contracts for sales to the us government and could be adversely affected by changes in those regulations or any negative findings from an audit or investigation 

we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the competitive environment in which we operate is particularly challenging during periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment with heavy promotions particularly of discretionary items the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores customer service quality and price of merchandise and services instock levels and merchandise assortment and presentation our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our expected results 

 

our inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate ourselves from competitors 

part of our expansion strategy includes continued differentiation from competitors to better distinguish our product offering we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national brand names the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial results 

 

expanding internationally presents unique challenges that will require us to adapt our store operations merchandising marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada and mexico and to work effectively with our joint venture partner in australia 

a significant portion of our anticipated store growth over the next five years will be in canada and mexico we are also in a joint venture with australia’s largest retailer woolworths limited to develop a network of home improvement stores for consumers in australia expanding internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks and slow the anticipated rate of such expansion 

 

if we are unable to secure or develop and implement sufficiently robust new technologies to deliver business process solutions within the appropriate time frame cost and functionality our strategic initiatives that are dependent upon these technologies may not be successful 

the success of our strategic initiatives designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers’ expenditures on home improvement projects is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the new business initiatives we are developing now and will be developing in the future would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

 

we may not be able to achieve the objectives of the strategic initiatives we have underway if our organization is unable to make the transformational changes we are undertaking in our business model 

we are adapting our business model to meet our customers’ changing expectations that we will not only sell them the products and services they need and want but also deliver using new tools skills and processes a full service experience by being a part of their home improvement projects from start to finish our strategies require transformational changes to our business model and will require new competencies in some positions and our employees and independent contractors such as thirdparty installers and repair technicians will not only have to understand nontraditional selling platforms but also commit to fundamental changes in lowe’s culture and the processes through which they have traditionally interacted with customers to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes our strategic initiatives designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers’ expenditures on home improvement projects may not be as successful as we expect them to be the many challenges our 

  

  

management faces in effectively managing our business as we adapt our business model also increase the risk that we may not achieve our objectives 

our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 

an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies cost reductions and sales and cash flow growth is the maintenance and ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as inventory replenishment merchandise ordering transportation receipt processing and product delivery our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to maintain improve upgrade and expand our systems 

 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our multichannel sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

access to the internet from computers smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them our website lowescom is a sales channel for our products and is also a method of making product project and other relevant information available to them that influences our instore sales in addition to lowescom we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire inform crosssell establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of lowe’s as a reliable source of information about home improvement products and services 

 

our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer employee or vendor data or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect such data 

cyber attacks designed to gain access to sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving and high profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized release of confidential information have occurred recently at a number of major us companies despite widespread recognition of the cyber attack threat and improved data protection methods while we have invested in the protection of our information technology and maintain what we believe are adequate security procedures and controls over financial and other individually identifiable customer employee and vendor data provided to us a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could nonetheless occur and have a material adverse effect on our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions loss of business or potential liability including for possible punitive damages an electronic security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of sensitive data from our information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks in addition as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other company’s obligation to protect such sensitive data becomes stricter a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits 

 

if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists or contract with qualified installers and repair technicians with expanded skill sets who can work effectively and collaboratively in an increasingly culturally diverse environment we could lose sales to our competitors 

our customers whether they are homeowners or commercial businesses expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide our customers also expect the independent contractors who install products they purchase from us to perform the installation in a timely and capable manner increasingly our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets including in some instances the ability to do inhome or telephone sales in addition in many of our stores our employees and thirdparty contractors must be able to serve customers whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own also as our employees as a group become increasingly culturally diverse our managers and sales associates must be able to manage and work collaboratively with employees whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own 

  

  

 

 

failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 

no single vendor of the products we sell accounts for more than 7 of our total purchases but we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business if these vendors or service providers fail or are unable to perform as expected and we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to do so and potentially in some cases permanently 

 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales profitability cash flows and financial condition 

product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe’s and the company’s brand image as a result lowe’s reputation as a retailer of high quality products and services including both national and lowe’s private brands could suffer and impact customer loyalty additionally a decline in product and service quality could result in product recalls product liability and warranty claims 

 

if the domestic or international supply chain for our products is disrupted our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted 

we source the approximately 40000 products we stock and sell from over 7000 domestic and international vendors we source a large number of those products from foreign manufacturers financial instability among key vendors political instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs 

future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and in the future will become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business some of these proceedings raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved individually or collectively is considered material

executive overview 

during 2011 we made progress towards delivering better customer experiences and transforming our business to drive longterm sales growth increased profitability and increased shareholder value we operate in an increasingly sociallyconnected world with realtime expectations and a wide range of customer service and selling channels our goal is to be relevant at each step of the home improvement process and to deliver an experience that is both seamless and simple rather than be a home improvement retailer focused on store expansion as the engine for growth we will be a home improvement company focused on maximizing asset productivity in order to grow 

building the foundation 

recognizing the need to adapt to this increasingly connected environment we made a series of important decisions during 2011 these decisions included investments to position us for improved execution today while enabling the customer experiences that will carry us into the future first we implemented changes to our management structure including the makeup of our senior executive team we also rationalized our existing and future store investments and accelerated significant upgrades to our information technology it infrastructure 

understanding the importance of responding quickly to the needs of the market we reorganized our fieldbased store operations and human resources organizations during 2011 reducing the field structure from 188 districts to 132 markets this followed our decision in late 2010 to modify a portion of our midlevel store management structure from a tiered structure into a singlelevel assistant store manager position as a result we are able to better coordinate our business and to push down the appropriate level of decision making and accountability to the working teams 

in addition to changes in management structure we performed a comprehensive review of our existing stores and our pipeline of proposed new stores during 2011 in an effort to focus resources in a manner that will generate the greatest shareholder value as a result we closed 27 underperforming stores in the second half of the year and discontinued a number of planned new store projects as part of the reassessment we also revised our future store expansion plan in north america and expect to open approximately 10 stores in 2012 and approximately 15 stores per year thereafter this represents a 50 reduction in our previous expansion plan 

  

  

in 2011 we also accelerated our investments in it and store systems infrastructure and increased our efforts to improve the customer experience we undertook our largest singleyear investment in it and store systems infrastructure to eliminate problems with slow response times hardtouse systems and lack of access to necessary technology this included upgrades to store it bandwidth and the installation of instore wireless networks to handle video downloads and provide customer access to wifi in addition we enhanced existing store functionality with iphones to provide store employees with better tools to assist the customer anywhere in the store these efforts contributed to the company’s total investments in it infrastructure of 841 million in 2011 

in 2012 we will continue to evaluate our corporate infrastructure which was built to support a singlechannel business that was opening over 100 stores per year today we are growing differently and our seamless multichannel strategy requires a different infrastructure in the first few weeks of 2012 we announced a planned reduction in the size of the staff at our us headquarters through a voluntary separation program in addition we are also working to change our culture to enable our teams to move faster on calculated risks in order to improve our execution and to support changing customer expectations we are refining our testandlearn capabilities to more quickly and costeffectively test new ideas before implementing changes companywide 

our promise for the future 

our promise continues to focus on three themes possibilities regarding home improvement solutions support and advice along the way and providing value beyond price keeping this promise requires us to maintain our commitment to retail excellence develop capabilities to provide seamless support across channels and projects and simplify the home improvement experience 

retail excellence 

in order to maintain our retail excellence our nearterm focus is on value improvement and product differentiation both of which will drive greater asset productivity our goal is to be the most efficient retailer our vendors do business with and we are working with them in a collaborative manner to identify costs that do not add value by eliminating these costs we are able to provide customers with the most competitivelypriced products every day across the multiple channels that they shop driving increases in sales and gross margin 

value improvement is built on a foundation of everyday low cost and tailored market assorting to ensure that we have the right product in the right market in the right quantity at the right price this will ensure that we are getting the lowest inventory acquisition cost and rationalizing the use of promotions which will allow us to provide low everyday retail prices everyday low prices result in more steady demand eliminating the peaks and valleys associated with promotions which will make us and our vendors more efficient during 2011 we also began implementing our integrated planning  execution ipe tools which ensure that our product assortments are locally customized and supported by the right level of inventory per store to produce better productivity for high turning products our market analysis teams work closely with merchants as they use the ipe tools to create the most efficient and effective product lines in each local market improving our relevance to the customer this process creates greater depth of instock highturning items and reduces the breadth of items with lower turns 

product differentiation will establish lowe’s as the place to find the newest and most relevant products for home improvement and involves refreshing displays in our stores while at the same time expanding our online product assortments beyond what we stock in our stores to meet the demands of customers through our test and learn approach we have rolled out a new store layout to approximately 500 stores using interactive endcaps that leverage innovative technology and consistent presentation to inspire our customers to attempt new and exciting projects they may not have otherwise considered in addition we lowered or completely removed racking in key areas of the store to better display our products and to make them more accessible and visible to customers as we test new concepts we will integrate those that work best into the store layout as we expand it to approximately 900 additional stores in 2012 we are creating a better shopping experience to deliver a compelling message of value and simplicity that will result in increased comparable store sales 

seamless across channels 

recognizing that customers increasingly shop across channels we are focused on providing a seamless multichannel experience making it convenient for them to engage with us wherever and whenever they choose over the past year we 

  

  

have made additions and enhancements to enable the seamless experience including interactions with our contact centers our exterior sales programs our website and our mobile applications we equipped our contact center associates with better tools and greater access to information as well as the ability to close a sale we continued to evolve our onsite selling model providing specialists with the appropriate tools to help customers visualize a project provide a realtime quote and tender a sale on site we also made incremental improvements to our online platform and by the end of the year there were over 250000 items available through our website and our toprated mobile application which launched this past august together these improvements contributed to a 22 increase in customer traffic and a 35 increase in conversion rates resulting in a 70 increase in online sales yearoveryear and a 100 basis point increase in online unit share in addition we now offer preprinted return labels for parcel shipments free of charge a simple and convenient option for customers and a competitive advantage in the home improvement industry furthermore in december we announced the acquisition of atg stores an online retailer of home improvement and lifestyle products which will allow us to more than double the number of items available through lowescom in 2012 

in addition to creating a more seamless experience for customers we also invested in technology to ensure that customers have access to an even wider range of products beyond our stores via lowescom through the rollout of our flexible fulfillment process flexible fulfillment allows any product that can be shipped parcel post and that is stocked in a regional distribution center store or vendors distribution center to be ordered online and shipped directly to a customer’s home or place of business in fiscal 2011 we fulfilled more than 275000 orders using our flexible fulfillment capabilities these are incremental transactions on products that were previously unavailable to customers online we continue to expand our flexible fulfillment capabilities and in 2012 will have the capability to fulfill any order from the most efficient location including our stores 

simple through knowledge and support 

in 2011 we launched mylowes an online tool that is unique in the home improvement industry and makes managing maintaining and improving homes simpler and more intuitive than ever before mylowes provides customers with a wide range of abilities to create home profiles save room dimensions and paint colors organize owner’s manuals and product warranties create shopping lists and set recurring reminders for common maintenance items as of the end of the year we had nearly three million customers activate mylowes cards in addition approximately 20 of mylowes members are either new customers or customers who havent shopped at lowes in over a year we expect mylowes to enable us to better serve our existing customer base and attract new customers 

in addition we have improved service in the aisles by equipping store employees with iphones and the necessary applications to give them immediate access to products and available quantities beyond the limits of the stores physical inventory no longer do store employees have to leave customers in the aisle to access a fixed terminal iphones give employees quick access to detailed information about products that customers are interested in and further supplements both the employees existing knowledge and point of purchase materials we provide we have already seen a positive impact on the time it takes to serve customers as well as the number of customers we are able to serve 

to leverage our employees’ knowledge we launched connections an online employee social business network that gives them the ability to easily share information at anytime employees have access to connections directly from the sales floor thereby increasing their breadth of knowledge and improving the customer experience 

all of the enhancements we made in 2011 are building momentum in developing deeper relationships with our customers that we believe will enable us to close more sales and improve profitability in 2012 and beyond 

  

  

operations 

the following tables set forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings as well as the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

  

  

 

1 the fiscal year ended february 3 2012 had 53 weeks the fiscal years ended january 28 2011 and january 29 2010 had 52 weeks 

2 ebit margin also referred to as operating margin is defined as earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales 

3 a comparable store is defined as a store that has been open longer than 13 months   a store that is identified for relocation is no longer considered comparable one month prior to its relocation the relocated store must then remain open longer than 13 months to be considered comparable a store we have decided to close is no longer considered comparable as of the beginning of the month in which we announce its closing the comparable store sales increase for 2011 included in the preceding table was calculated using sales for a comparable 53week period 

4 average ticket is defined as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions 

5 average store size selling square feet is defined as sales floor square feet divided by the number of stores open at the end of the period 

6 return on average assets is defined as net earnings divided by average total assets for the last five quarters 

7 return on average shareholders’ equity is defined as net earnings divided by average shareholders’ equity for the last five quarters 

8 return on invested capital is a nongaap measure see below for additional information 

return on invested capital 

return on invested capital roic is considered a nongaap financial measure we believe roic is a meaningful metric for investors because it measures how effectively the company uses capital to generate profits 

we define roic as trailing four quarters net operating profit after tax divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters although roic is a common financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating roic accordingly the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roic we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roic before comparing its roic to ours 

we consider return on average debt and equity to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to roic the difference between these two measures is that roic adjusts net earnings to exclude tax adjusted interest expense 

the calculation of roic together with a reconciliation to the calculation of return on average debt and equity the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows 

  

  

 

 

1 income tax adjustment is defined as earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by the effective tax rate 

2 average debt and equity is defined as average debt including current maturities and shortterm borrowings plus total equity for the last five quarters 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

for the purpose of the following discussion comparable store sales comparable store average ticket and comparable store customer transactions are based on comparable 53week periods 

net sales – net sales increased 29 to 502 billion in 2011 while comparable store sales were flat the additional week in 2011 contributed 16 to the increase in net sales comparable store customer transactions increased approximately 04 and comparable store average ticket decreased 04 versus 2010 

while comparable stores sales were flat in 2011 we saw sequential improvement each quarter with comparable store sales of negative 33 in the first quarter negative 03 in the second quarter positive 07 in the third quarter and positive 34 in the fourth quarter unseasonably cold wet weather severe storms and flooding during the first quarter as well as comparisons to the 2010 cash for appliances government incentive program led to lower performance during the first half of the year however as comparisons to the cash for appliances program eased and storm recovery efforts were underway we saw improvement in comparable store sales in addition strong customer response to our 5 off everyday offer to lowe’s credit cardholders launched in the first half of 2011 aided comparable store sales for the balance of the year 

  

  

we experienced comparable store sales above the company average in the following product categories during 2011 building materials rough plumbing tools fashion electrical paint and hardware in addition home fashions storage  cleaning seasonal living flooring nursery and lumber performed at approximately the overall company average although unfavorable weather in the early part of the year negatively impacted outdoor categories such as building materials recovery efforts after severe spring storms that hit many regions of the country and hurricane irene positively impacted comparable store sales in building materials with particularly strong sales of roofing products and installation services rough plumbing also benefited from the wet weather and storm recovery efforts with strong sales of pumps  tanks and dehumidifiers in addition tools experienced favorable comparable store sales primarily driven by holiday promotions and strong customer response to new products such as our new line of kobalt mechanics tools fashion electrical also performed above the company average during 2011 driven by increased customer demand for energysaving light bulbs outdoor lighting and electrical cable 

however difficult comparisons to prior year energy tax credits negatively impacted comparable store sales in millwork in addition while we experienced strong market share gains in cabinets  countertops they were not enough to offset the impact of the contracting market leading to comparable store sales below the company average for the year appliances also experienced negative comparable store sales for the year driven by comparisons to the prior year cash for appliances program which primarily impacted the first half of the year 

gross margin – gross margin of 3456 for 2011 represented a 58 basis point decrease from 2010 primarily driven by margin rate strong customer response to our 5 off everyday offer to lowe’s credit cardholders targeted promotional activity and pricing changes associated with our move to everyday low prices negatively impacted margin for the year margin was also negatively impacted by 19 basis points associated with distribution expenses primarily related to higher fuel costs in addition lower of cost or market inventory adjustments primarily related to the 27 stores that closed in the second half of the year negatively impacted margin by six basis points these were partially offset by 15 basis points of favorable impact associated with the mix of products sold across product categories 

sga – the increase in sga expense as a percentage of sales from 2010 to 2011 was primarily driven by deleverage of 83 basis points related to charges for store closings discontinued projects and longlived asset impairments we also experienced approximately 15 basis points of deleverage related to investments made to improve customer experiences including expenses associated with additional internal and external staffing and technology expenditures in addition we experienced deleverage in payroll taxes and fleet expense these increases were partially offset by leverage of approximately 40 basis points associated with our proprietary credit program due to reduced program costs associated with lower losses and lower promotional financing as more customers took advantage of the 5 off every day offer in addition bonus expense leveraged 30 basis points due to lower attainment levels for the year relative to plan 

depreciation – depreciation expense leveraged 30 basis points for 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a lower asset base resulting from decreased capital spending and assets becoming fully depreciated or impaired property less accumulated depreciation decreased to 220 billion at february 3 2012 compared to 221 billion at january 28 2011 at february 3 2012 and january 28 2011 we owned 89 of our stores which included stores on leased land 

interest – net interest expense is comprised of the following 

 

net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of 20 billion of notes during 2010 and 10 billion of notes during 2011 offset by the repayment of 500 million of notes during 2010 

income tax provision – our   effective income tax rate was 367 in 2011 compared to 377 in 2010 the reduction in the effective tax rate was predominantly due to the recognition of benefits from the federal hire hiring incentives to restore employment retention tax credit as well as various state tax credit programs 

  

  

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

net sales – net sales increased 34 to 488 billion in 2010 comparable store sales increased 13 in 2010 compared to a decline of 67 in 2009 we experienced comparable store sales increases over 2009 for each quarter and saw evidence of economic stabilization as comparable store sales performance was more balanced across geographic markets in 2010 comparable store customer transactions increased 09 and comparable store average ticket increased 05 versus 2009 as larger project sales remained slow for the year 

overall while growth in household spending moderately accelerated late in the year it remained constrained by high unemployment modest income growth lower housing wealth and tight credit as a result customers continued to focus on nondiscretionary and smaller discretionary projects during 2010 this focus was reflected by strength in categories that support smaller projects such as tools and lawn  landscape both of which outperformed the company average meanwhile categories that are more discretionary in nature such as fashion plumbing cabinets  countertops and home fashions storage  cleaning were negatively impacted by the remaining market uncertainty and performed below the company average 

we seized opportunities during the year to drive additional sales by quickly executing programs that helped customers benefit from government incentives the cash for appliances rebate program as well as our continued focus on marketspecific assortments to ensure that we have the right products in the right markets helped drive comparable store sales increases above the company average for our appliances category in addition our pse program along with focused special order sales promotions helped customers take advantage of the higher tax credits for energyefficient improvements that expired at the end of the year the pse program also helped us to increase our 2010 comparable store installed sales over 10 with the greatest growth occurring in millwork lumber and building materials 

comparable store sales for our seasonal living category also outperformed the company average for 2010 the increase was driven by improved sellthrough of grills and grill accessories patio furniture and holiday assortments as well as increased sales of room air conditioners as a result of prolonged extreme heat across the us in the middle of the year 

gross margin – gross margin of 3514 for 2010 represented a 28 basis point increase over 2009 the increase was driven by improvements in margin rates primarily in seasonal living lumber and hardware which resulted in 38 basis points of improvement the rate increase is primarily attributable to better sellthrough of seasonal inventory this year relative to 2009 our increased number of competitive pricing zones and our base price optimization strategy the rate improvement was partially offset by a 17 basis point unfavorable impact from the mix of products sold across categories driven by increased sales in appliances 

sga – the decrease in sga as a percentage of sales from 2009 to 2010 was primarily driven by leverage of 23 basis points in bonus expense due to lower attainment levels relative to plan impairment and discontinued project expense leveraged 13 basis points due to lower charges associated with existing stores as well as fewer construction projects discontinued in the current year we also experienced nine basis points of leverage associated with our proprietary credit programs due to decreased program costs for the year this was partially offset by deleverage in store payroll due to the impact of the new facilities service associate fsa position and wage growth fleet expense due to increased deliveries related to free delivery promotions and increased average fuel costs and bank card expense due to increased bank card transaction volume and higher transaction fees 

depreciation – depreciation expense decreased slightly for 2010 compared to 2009 due to a lower asset base resulting from decreased capital spending and assets becoming fully depreciated in 2010 property less accumulated depreciation decreased to 221 billion at january 28 2011 compared to 225 billion at january 29 2010 at january 28 2011 and january 29 2010 we owned 89 and 88 of our stores respectively which included stores on leased land 

  

  

interest – net interest expense is comprised of the following 

 

net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of 20 billion of notes during 2010 and due to the impact of tax settlements that favorably impacted our taxrelated interest accruals in 2009 offset by the repayment of 500 million of notes during 2010 

income tax provision – our effective income tax rate was 377 in 2010 versus 369 in 2009 the lower effective tax rate in 2009 was primarily due to certain prior year favorable state tax settlements which decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 70 basis points 

lowe’s business outlook 

our fiscal year 2012 contains 52 weeks as compared to our fiscal 2011 which contained 53 weeks therefore our fiscal 2012 growth rates with the exception of comparable store sales which is computed on a 52week versus 52 week basis will be negatively impacted by comparing 52 weeks with 53 weeks in fiscal 2011 

as of february 27 2012 the date of our fourth quarter 2011 earnings release we expected total sales in 2012 to increase 1 to 2 we expected comparable store sales to increase 1 to 3 in 2012 we expected to open approximately 10 stores during 2012 earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales operating margin were expected to increase approximately 100 basis points in addition depreciation expense was expected to be approximately 15 billion diluted earnings per share of 175 to 185 were expected for the fiscal year ending february 1 2013 our guidance assumed approximately 45 billion in share repurchases during 2012 spread evenly across the four quarters 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2011 versus 2010 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings adjusted for noncash charges related to net losses on property and other assets and changes in working capital the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for 2011 versus 2010 was driven by net cash inflows related to investments partially offset by an increase in cash used for property acquired related to investments in corporate systems and store information technology net cash used in financing activities for 2011 was primarily driven by share repurchases of 29 billion which was partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of 10 billion of notes in november 2011 net cash used in financing activities for 2010 was primarily driven by share repurchases of 26 billion which was partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of 20 billion of notes in april and november 2010 and the repayment of 500 million of notes that matured in june 2010 

sources of liquidity 

in addition to our cash flows from operations liquidity is provided by our shortterm borrowing facilities and through the issuance of longterm debt on october 25 2011 we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement amended facility to modify the senior credit facility dated june 2007 which provided for borrowings of up to 175 billion through june 2012 the amended facility extends the maturity date to october 2016 and continues to provide for borrowings of up to 175 billion the amended facility supports our commercial paper program and has a 500 million letter of credit sublimit letters of credit issued pursuant to the amended facility reduce the amount available for 

  

  

borrowing under its terms borrowings made are unsecured and are priced at fixed rates based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the amended facility the amended facility contains certain restrictive covenants which include maintenance of a debt leverage ratio as defined by the amended facility we were in compliance with those covenants at february 3 2012 thirteen banking institutions are participating in the amended facility there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the amended facility and no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program at february 3 2012 

we have a canadian dollar c denominated credit facility in the amount of c50 million that provides revolving credit support for our canadian operations this uncommitted credit facility provides us with the ability to make unsecured borrowings which are priced at fixed rates based upon market conditions at the time of funding in accordance with the terms of the credit facility as of february 3 2012 there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 

in 2011 our board of directors approved a change in the financial metric we use to determine our available debt capacity from time to time at february 3 2012 our available debt capacity was 96 billion which compared to debt outstanding at that date of 76 billion we plan to issue additional debt during 2012 and expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes which may include repurchases of shares of our common stock capital expenditures repayment of longterm debt maturities acquisitions other strategic initiatives and working capital needs the amount and timing of any additional debt issuances in 2012 will depend upon not only our financial performance and estimated available debt capacity at the time but also upon macroeconomic and debt capital market conditions during the year 

we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both short and longterm bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new longterm debt the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected however by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard  poor’s sp and moody’s as of april 2 2012 which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds although we currently do not expect a downgrade in our debt ratings our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

 

we believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate not only for our operating requirements but also for our expansion plans investments in our existing stores investments in information technology repurchases of shares of common stock and acquisitions if any over the next 12 months there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price in addition we do not have a significant amount of cash held in foreign affiliates 

cash requirements 

capital expenditures 

our fiscal 2012 capital budget is approximately 14 billion inclusive of approximately 100 million of lease commitments resulting in a planned net cash outflow of 13 billion approximately 45 of the planned net cash outflow is for investments to enhance the customer experience inclusive of enhancements in information technology existing stores account for approximately 30 of planned net cash outflow including investments in resets and remerchandising in addition approximately 15 of the planned net cash outflow is for store expansion our expansion plans for 2012 consist of approximately 10 new stores and are expected to increase sales floor square footage slightly all of the 2012 projects are expected to be owned which includes approximately 35 of the stores on leased land other planned capital expenditures include investing in our distribution network a part of which is the addition of one regional distribution center 

  

  

during 2009 we entered into a joint venture agreement with australian retailer woolworths limited to develop a chain of home improvement stores in australia as of february 3 2012 we had contributed approximately 375 million the venture opened its first seven stores under the name masters tm in 2011 and expects to open 15 to 20 stores in 2012 

debt and capital 

in november 2011 we issued 10 billion of unsecured notes in two tranches 500 million of 38 notes maturing in november 2021 and 500 million of 5125 notes maturing in november 2041 net proceeds from the 38 and 5125 notes were 497 million and 495 million respectively net proceeds were available for general corporate purposes including repurchases of shares of our common stock capital expenditures acquisitions and working capital needs 

dividends declared during fiscal 2011 totaled 672 million our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the subsequent quarter to their declaration dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2011 were paid in fiscal 2012 and totaled 174 million 

we have a share repurchase program that is executed through purchases made from time to time in the open market or through private transactions shares purchased under the share repurchase program are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status on august 19 2011 the companys board of directors authorized a new 50 billion share repurchase program with no expiration as of february 3 2012 we had a remaining repurchase authorization of 45 billion we expect to utilize the remaining authorization by the end of fiscal 2012 

the ratio of debt to equity plus debt was 316 and 266 as of february 3 2012 and january 28 2011 respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

other than in connection with executing operating leases we do not have any offbalance sheet financing that has or is reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flows results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at february 3 2012 

 

1   amounts do not include taxes common area maintenance insurance or contingent rent because these amounts have historically been insignificant 

2 represents commitments related to certain marketing and information technology programs and purchases of merchandise inventory 

at february 3 2012 our reserve for uncertain tax positions including penalties and interest net of amounts held on deposit by taxing authorities was 111 million of which 107 million was classified as a current liability and 4 million was classified as a noncurrent liability at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 

  

at february 3 2012 the company had no significant commercial commitments 

 

  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this form 10k requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 

merchandise inventory 

description 

we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels sales trends and historical experience during 2011 our reserve increased approximately 8 million to 47 million as of february 3 2012 

we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage results from previous physical inventories during 2011 the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately 14 million to 141 million as of february 3 2012 

in addition we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business principally as a result of purchase volumes sales early payments or promotions of vendors’ products which generally do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor’s product we treat these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are accrued and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions however changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves likewise changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and results of physical inventories we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of nonproductive inventory and assumptions about net realizable value 

for vendor funds we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreements we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves however it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves a 10 change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 3 million for 2011 a 10 change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately 9 million for 2011 

  

  

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective longterm estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material 

longlived asset impairment 

description 

we review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable when evaluating locations for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead 

we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to longlived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location’s asset carrying values may not be recoverable for operating locations our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a 12month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment including individual locations’ execution of their operating plans and local market conditions including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe’s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location’s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location management makes assumptions incorporating local market conditions about key store variables including sales growth rates gross margin and controllable expenses such as store payroll and occupancy expense as well as asset residual values or lease rates an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 

we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations which requires discounting projected future cash flows this involves making assumptions regarding both a location’s future cash flows as described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours 

we use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for closure this involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated the information includes comparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these assets 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows including estimated sales margin and controllable expenses and assumptions about market performance for operating locations and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach 

  

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during 2011 12 operating locations and 27 locations identified for closure experienced a triggering event and were evaluated for recoverability four of the 12 operating locations and all 27 of the locations identified for closure were determined to be impaired we recorded impairment losses related to operating locations and locations identified for closure of 309 million during 2011 compared to 36 million during 2010 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values our actual impairment losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment losses 

eight of the 12 operating locations that experienced a triggering event during 2011 were determined to be recoverable and therefore were not impaired for seven of these locations the expected undiscounted cash flows substantially exceeded the net book value of the location’s assets a 10 reduction in projected sales used to estimate future cash flows at the latest date that these eight operating locations were evaluated for impairment would have resulted in the impairment of one of these locations and increased recognized impairment losses by approximately 9 million 

we analyzed other assumptions made in estimating the future cash flows of the operating locations evaluated for impairment but the sensitivity of those assumptions was not significant to the estimates 

all 27 of the locations identified for closure during 2011 were determined to be impaired for these locations a 10 reduction in the estimated selling prices for owned locations or the present value of estimated cash inflows from sublease activity for leased locations at the dates that the locations were evaluated for impairment would have increased recognized impairment losses by approximately 7 million 

store closing lease obligations 

description 

when locations under operating leases are closed we recognize a liability for the fair value of future contractual obligations associated with the leased location the fair value of the store closing lease obligation is determined using an expected present value cash flow model incorporating future minimum lease payments property taxes utilities common area maintenance and other ongoing expenses net of estimated sublease income and other recoverable items discounted at a creditadjusted risk free rate the expected present value cash flow model uses a probability weighted scenario approach that assigns varying cash flows to certain scenarios based on the expected likelihood of outcomes estimating the fair value involves making assumptions regarding estimated sublease income by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated the information includes comparable lease rates of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for leasing these assets subsequent changes to the liability including a change resulting from a revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flows are recognized in the period of the change 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our store closing lease liability calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows primarily related to estimated sublease income and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

during 2011 13 stores under operating lease were closed which includes one store that was relocated we recorded 76 million of expense for store closing lease obligations during 2011 these charges included 67 million related to new liabilities recorded during 2011 and 9 million of adjustments related to previously recorded liabilities 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the expected future cash flows of closed locations under operating leases during the past three fiscal years if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in estimating expected future cash flows our store closing lease obligation losses could vary positively or negatively from our estimated losses a 10 decrease in the estimated present value of 

  

  

cash inflows from sublease activity for the 13 stores under operating lease that closed during 2011 would have increased expenses recorded for lease obligations by approximately 11 million 

selfinsurance 

description 

we are selfinsured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation automobile property general and product liability  extended protection plan and certain medical and dental claims selfinsurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for selfinsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during 2011 our selfinsurance liability increased approximately 29 million to 864 million as of february 3 2012 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposures including payroll sales and vehicle units as well as the frequency lag and severity of claims 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our selfinsurance liability during the past three fiscal years although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded selfinsurance liabilities a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately 55 million for 2011 a 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately 20 million for 2011 

revenue recognition 

description 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the effects of future events that cannot be determined with certainty 

we sell separatelypriced extended protection plan contracts under a lowe’sbranded program for which the company is ultimately selfinsured the company recognizes revenues from extended protection plan sales on a straightline basis over the respective contract term extended protection plan contract terms primarily range from one to four years from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer’s warranty as applicable the company consistently groups and evaluates extended protection plan contracts based on the characteristics of the underlying products and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected losses a loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected costs of performing services under the contracts exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition costs and related deferred revenue associated with the contracts deferred revenues associated with the extended protection plan contracts increased 73 million to 704 million as of february 3 2012 

we defer revenue and cost of sales associated with settled transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed revenue is deferred based on the actual amounts received we use historical gross margin rates to estimate the adjustment to cost of sales for these transactions during 2011 deferred revenues associated with these transactions increased 59 million to 430 million as of february 3 2012 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

for extended protection plans there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected losses as a result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contracts and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contracts there is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of costs of performing services under these contracts 

for the deferral of revenue and cost of sales associated with transactions for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed there is judgment inherent in our estimates of gross margin rates 

  

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contracts during the past three fiscal years we currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract losses on our extended protection plan contracts although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected losses under the extended protection plan contracts it is possible that actual results could differ from our estimates in addition if future evidence indicates that the costs of performing services under these contracts are incurred on other than a straightline basis the timing of revenue recognition under these contracts could change a 10 change in the amount of revenue recognized in 2011 under these contracts would have affected net earnings by approximately 12 million 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to reverse net sales and cost of sales related to amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates related to the impact to cost of sales for these transactions however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may incur additional income or expense a 10 change in the estimate of the gross margin rates applied to these transactions would have affected net earnings by approximately 7 million in 2011 

  

  

  

disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements 

we speak throughout this annual report on form 10k in forwardlooking statements about our future but particularly in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the words “believe” “expect” “will” “should” and other similar expressions are intended to identify those forwardlooking statements while we believe our expectations are reasonable they are not guarantees of future performance our actual results could differ substantially from our expectations 

for a detailed description of the risks and uncertainties that we are exposed to you should read the “risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k to the united states securities and exchange commission all forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this report or in the case of any document incorporated by reference the date of that document all subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section and in the “risk factors” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forwardlooking statements to reflect events circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report 

  

  

 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and consists of fixedrate instruments therefore providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for financial instruments 

commodity price risk 

we purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control we believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices the selling prices of these commodity products are influenced in part by the market price we pay which is determined by industry supply and demand 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although we have international operating entities our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition and results of operations

our market 

using the most recent comprehensive data available which is from 2009 we estimate the size of the us home improvement market to be approximately 570 billion annually comprised of 430 billion of product demand and 140 billion of installed labor opportunity we analyzed data from a variety of primary and secondary sources including trade associations government publications industry participants and other sources as the basis for our estimate this data captures a wide range of categories relevant to our business including major appliances and garden supplies based on the most recently available data we believe that the size of the us home improvement market decreased approximately 11 in 2009 

 

we are among the many businesses including home centers paint stores hardware stores lumber yards and garden centers whose revenues are included in the building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers subsector 444 of the retail trade sector of the north american industry classification system naics the standard used by federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting analyzing and publishing statistical data related to the us business economy the total annual revenue reported for businesses included in naics subsector 444 in 2009 was 271 billion which represented a decline of 115 from the total amount reported in 2008 this decline is similar to our estimate of the decline in the larger overall us home improvement market the total annual revenue reported for businesses included in naics subsector 444 in 2010 was 287 billion which represented an increase of 61 over the amount reported for 2009 we have observed similar trends in the data we are collecting which we will use to estimate the size of the larger overall us home improvement market for 2010 

 

there are many variables that impact consumer demand for the home improvement products and services we offer key indicators we monitor include employment home prices real disposable personal income housing turnover and home ownership levels we also monitor demographic and societal trends that are indicators of home improvement industry growth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

currently these indicators suggest moderately improving consumer demand for the home improvement products and services that we sell however in this uncertain economic environment we continue to balance implementation of our longterm growth plans with our nearterm focus on improving performance and maintaining adequate liquidity 

 

 

  

  

  

  

our competition 

the home improvement retailing business includes many competitors we compete with other chains of home improvement warehouse stores and lumberyards in most of our trade areas we also compete with traditional hardware plumbing electrical and home supply retailers in addition we compete with respect to some of our products with general merchandise retailers mail order firms warehouse clubs online and other specialty retailers the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores customer service quality and price of merchandise and services merchandise assortment and presentation and instock levels see further discussion of competition in item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k

compliance with environmental matters 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment they have in the past and may in the future increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways including indirectly through increased energy costs as producers of energy and petroleum and potentially other major emitters of greenhouse gases are subjected to increased or new regulation or legislation that results in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2011 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with such laws or regulations

 item 1a – risk factors 

we have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys external research risk mapping analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational financial environmental reputational strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business for more information about our risk management process which is administered by our chief risk officer and includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify see the description included in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders under “the board’s role in risk oversight” 

we describe below all known material risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or business prospects these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended supplemented or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in our future periodic reports on form 10k form 10q and reports on other forms we file with the securities and exchange commission all forwardlooking statements about our future results of operations or other matters made by us in this annual report on form 10k in our annual report to lowe’s shareholders and in our subsequently filed reports to the securities and exchange commission as well as in our press releases and other public communications are qualified by the risks described below 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy 

general economic factors and other conditions both domestically and internationally may adversely affect the us economy the global economy and our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of slow economic growth or recession volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of borrowing to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income sustained high rates of unemployment unsupportable consumer debt levels increasing fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters acts of terrorism and developments in the war against terrorism in asia the middle east and other parts of the world 

adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable store sales 

sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects steep declines over the last four years in home prices the increasing number of households with little or negative equity high mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates the reduction in the availability of mortgage financing slower household formation growth rates and lower housing turnover through existing home sales which is a major driver of our business have limited and may continue to limit consumers’ discretionary spending particularly on larger home improvement projects that are important to our business the large number of borrowers who remain at risk of potentially losing their homes through foreclosures or short sales coupled with the voluntary and involuntary halts of foreclosure proceedings by lenders due to legal challenges to the adequacy of their documentation and record keeping could prolong the downturn in the housing and home improvement markets and negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and our comparable store sales 

 

 

  

  

  

  

changes in existing or new laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

laws and regulations at the state federal and international levels change frequently and can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our vendors any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation that affects employmentlabor trade product safety transportationlogistics energy costs health care tax or environmental issues could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations 

we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the competitive environment in which we operate is particularly challenging during periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment with heavy promotions particularly of discretionary items the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores customer service quality and price of merchandise and services instock levels and merchandise assortment and presentation our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our expected results 

if our employees or thirdparty installers and repair technicians are unable to accept and embrace changes in our business model we may not be able to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives 

we are adapting our business model to meet our customers’ changing expectations that we will not only sell them the products they need and want but also deliver a full service experience by being a part of their home improvement projects from start to finish our goal is to simplify the complex process of home improvement provide better project execution than our competitors and generally make the process of doing a small or large home improvement project as seamless as possible reaching that goal on a continual basis requires that we deliver a consistent look and feel as our customers interact with lowe’s through our stores our web site our contact center our project specialists who meet with them in their homes our thirdparty installers and repair technicians and our inhome delivery of products they purchase online or in our stores this will require new competencies in some positions and our employees thirdparty installers and repair technicians will not only have to understand nontraditional selling platforms but also commit to changing how they have traditionally interacted with our customers to the extent they are unable or unwilling to embrace and accept these changes in our business model our strategic initiatives designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers’ expenditures on home improvement projects   may not be as successful as we expect them to be 

our inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate ourselves from competitors 

part of our expansion strategy includes continued differentiation from competitors to better distinguish our product offering we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national brand names the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial results 

expanding internationally presents unique challenges that will require us to adapt our store operations merchandising marketing and distribution functions to serve customers in canada and mexico and to work effectively with our joint venture partner in australia 

about onethird of our anticipated store growth over the next five years will be in canada and mexico we are also in a joint venture with australia’s largest retailer woolworths limited to develop a network of home improvement stores for consumers in australia expanding internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks and slow the anticipated rate of such expansion 

 

 

  

  

  

  

if we are unable to secure or develop and implement sufficiently robust new technologies to deliver business process solutions within the appropriate time frame cost and functionality our strategic business initiatives that are dependent upon these technologies may not be successful 

the success of our strategic business initiatives   designed to increase our sales and capture a greater percentage of our customers’ expenditures on home improvement projects is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them the users and the developers of these technology systems share the responsibility for their timely and costeffective delivery as well as their functionality requiring them to collaborate and cooperate closely with one another extended delays or cost overruns in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the new business initiatives we are developing now and will be developing in the future would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives 

our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 

an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies cost reductions and sales and cash flow growth is the maintenance and ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems that support operations such as inventory replenishment merchandise ordering transportation receipt processing and product delivery our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to maintain improve upgrade and expand our systems 

as customerfacing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our multichannel sales and marketing strategy the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences 

access to the internet from computers smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them our website lowescom is a sales channel for our products and is also a method of making product project and other relevant information available to them that influences a large portion of our instore sales in addition to lowescom we have multiple affiliated websites through which we seek to inspire inform crosssell establish online communities among and otherwise interact with our customers performance issues with these customerfacing technology systems or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of lowe’s as a reliable source of information about home improvement products and services 

our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer employee or vendor data or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect such data 

while we have invested heavily in the protection of our information technology and maintain what we believe are adequate security controls over individually identifiable customer employee and vendor data provided to us a breakdown or a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could nonetheless occur and have a material adverse effect on our reputation operating results and financial condition such a breakdown or breach could also materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such risks also the regulatory environment relating to our obligation to protect such sensitive data is becoming stricter a material failure on our part to comply with these evolving regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits 

if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists or contract with qualified installers and repair technicians with expanded skill sets who can work effectively and collaboratively in an increasingly culturally diverse environment we could lose sales to our competitors 

our customers whether they are homeowners or commercial businesses expect our sales associates and specialists to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide our customers also expect the independent contractors who install products they purchase from us to perform the installation in a timely and capable manner increasingly our sales associates and specialists must have expanded skill sets including in some instances the ability to do inhome or telephone sales in addition in many of our stores our employees and thirdparty contractors must be able to serve customers whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own also as our employees as a group become increasingly culturally diverse our managers and sales associates must be able to manage and work collaboratively with employees whose primary language and cultural traditions are different from their own 

  

  

 

 

failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business  

no single vendor of the products we sell accounts for more than 8 of our total purchases but we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business if these vendors or service providers fail or are unable to perform as expected and we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily until we are able to do so and potentially in some cases permanently 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales profitability cash flows and financial condition 

product and service quality issues could result in negative impact on customer confidence in lowe’s and the company’s brand image as a result lowe’s reputation as a retailer of high quality products including both national and lowe’s private brands could suffer additionally a decline in product and service quality could result in product recalls product liability and warranty claims 

if the domestic or international supply chain for our products is disrupted our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted 

we source the approximately 40000 products we stock and sell from over 7000 domestic and international vendors we source an increasing number of those products directly from foreign manufacturers financial instability among key vendors political instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs

we opened 62 new stores in fiscal 2009 including five canadian stores our 2009 store openings included three primary prototypes 117000squarefoot 117k and 103000squarefoot 103k stores for large markets and a 94000squarefoot 94k store to serve smaller markets the following table illustrates our store expansion over the last three years 

 

 

we expect to open 40 to 45 new stores in fiscal 2010 that estimate includes continued expansion of our store base in canada including our first stores in western canada as well as our first stores in monterrey mexico our fiscal 2010 store openings will be comprised primarily of 117k 103k and 94k stores as we continue our expansion and strive to maximize our return on investment we consider market demographics and land availability among other factors to determine the appropriate prototype for a particular market the reduction in store openings in 2010 as compared to 2009 reflects the continued challenging current economic environment 

employees 

  

as of january 29 2010 we employed approximately 166000 fulltime and 73000 parttime employees none of which in the us or canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements management considers its relations with its employees to be good 

seasonality and working capital 

the retail business in general is subject to seasonal influences and our business is to some extent seasonal historically we have realized the highest volume of sales during our fiscal second quarter may june and july and the lowest volume of sales during our fiscal fourth quarter november december and january accordingly our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fiscal fourth quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fiscal fourth quarter sales volumes we fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations but also with shortterm borrowings if needed for more detailed information see the financial condition liquidity and capital resources section in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

some highlights of our environmental leadership include  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition to operating our stores as efficiently as possible by reducing our energy and water usage we are striving to get products to our stores in an environmentally responsible manner our conservation strategies and continued contributions to the transportation industry have been honored by multiple smartway environmental excellence awards an innovative program   launched by the us environmental protection agency in 2004 that represents environmentally cleaner more fuel efficient transportation options to earn those awards we implemented initiatives that resulted in reduced carbon dioxide emissions and less overall highway congestion these included increasing shipping by rail increasing efficiency of truckload shipments allowing more products to be shipped on fewer trailers and continuing to use a higher percentage of smartway carriers 

compliance with environmental matters 

our operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment they have in the past and may in the future increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways including indirectly through increased energy and product costs as producers of energy cement iron steel pulp paper petroleum and other major emitters of greenhouse gases are subjected to increased or new regulation or legislation that results in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2010 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with such laws or regulations

 item 1a – risk factors 

we are exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties most are general risks and uncertainties applicable to all retailers but some are more particular to retailers serving the home improvement industry our operations may also be affected by factors that are either not currently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial to our business we describe below some of the specific known factors that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations all forwardlooking statements made by us in this annual report to the securities and exchange commission on form 10k in our annual report to shareholders and in our subsequently filed quarterly and current reports to the securities and exchange commission as well as in our press releases and other public communications are qualified by the risks described below 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy 

general economic factors and other conditions both domestically and internationally may adversely affect the us economy the global economy and our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of flat economic growth or recession volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of credit to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income higher rates of unemployment higher consumer debt levels increasing fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters acts of terrorism and developments in the war against terrorism in asia the middle east and other parts of the world 

the global recession that began in the us in december 2007 and the slow recovery that we believe is currently under way together with the financialcredit crisis that erupted during the fall of 2008 and led to the collapse government bailout or acquisition of numerous weakened financial institutions have had and will continue to have significant adverse effects on our results of operations continued high rates of unemployment the psychological effect of falling home prices volatility in consumer confidence indices consumer deleveraging and reduced access to credit have combined to lead to sharply reduced consumer spending particularly by our customers on many of the discretionary bigticket items we sell that tend to be larger home improvement project driven for these reasons consumer confidence and willingness to spend on discretionary items remain relatively low and although we expect them to be stronger in 2010 than 2009 our sales and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected throughout the 2010 fiscal year 

adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable store sales 

sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by housing turnover and activity level of home improvement projects the expiration of government stimulus programs specific to the housing sector during the second half of fiscal year 2010 may adversely affect the rate of housing turnover steep declines over the last three years in home prices the increasing number of households with negative equity increasing mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates reduction in the availability of mortgage financing rising interest rates on variable rate mortgages and significantly lower housing turnover have limited and may continue to limit consumers’ discretionary spending particularly on discretionary items and affect their confidence level to spend on larger home improvement projects the impact of these economic factors specific to the home improvement industry is exacerbated by what is expected to be a gradual and prolonged period of economic recovery with slow employment growth 

unseasonable weather conditions and adverse weather events can negatively affect our total sales and comparable store sales 

if weather conditions are uncharacteristic of the time of year during any season they can hurt our sales by making it difficult to sell seasonal merchandise although the impact of unseasonable weather conditions is mitigated somewhat by the broad geographic dispersion of our stores they continue to be a significant risk to the overall performance of our business particularly when they occur across a broad region of the us adverse weather events such as a prolonged and widespread drought can hurt our sales of particular products as well 

our store expansion and relocation strategy depends upon our ability to successfully open and operate new stores each year 

our growth in total sales depends not only on a recovery from the current recessionary period but also to a substantial degree on successfully and costeffectively implementing our ongoing expansion program we have scaled back our expansion plans significantly in the last two years and plan to scale them back further during fiscal year 2010 in response to the weak macroeconomic environment as we expand further we must adapt our merchandising marketing and distribution initiatives to new markets both domestically and internationally as we continue to expand into canada and mexico international expansion presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and slow the anticipated rate of such expansion 

we also plan to increase the number of our stores in markets in which we currently operate our ability to open additional stores depends in large measure upon our ability to locate and acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings in the formats with which we operate may affect our ability to open new stores in some markets as we develop more new stores in metropolitan markets we may incur increased costs to remediate environmental pollution on some of the sites we are redeveloping that was caused by previous owners of those sites our ability to continue to expand our operations depends also on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees if we are unable to open new stores at the 

 

  

  

 

rate we currently plan and staff them with qualified employees the growth in our sales and our competitive position could be adversely affected 

if we fail to hire train and retain qualified managers sales associates and other employees we could lose sales to our competitors 

customers’ perceptions of the quality of service provided by employees can determine any retailer’s success or failure if we fail to attract train and retain qualified managers and sales associates our financial performance could be adversely impacted consumers shopping for goods and services for home improvement projects expect to have sales associates serving them who are knowledgeable about product categories located throughout our stores excessive turnover which has historically been high among employees in entrylevel or parttime positions increases the risk that sales associates will not have the training and experience needed to provide competitive high quality customer service 

our success in serving the needs of commercial business customers is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified commercial sales specialists 

commercial business customers in the home improvement industry require that we have welltrained commercial sales specialists at our project desks by doing so we can better serve the needs of this customer on a consistent basis our commercial sales specialists have a great depth of knowledge about the products needed by commercial business customers if we fail to staff our project desks with experienced and knowledgeable employees we run the risk that we will lose commercial business customers 

we have many competitors who if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively could take sales and market share from us 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the competitive environment in which we operate is particularly challenging during recessionary and economic recovery periods with heavy promotions particularly of discretionary items and competitor closings the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our expected results 

an unusual number of product liability or breach of warranty claims for defective products could expose us to expensive claims and damage our standing with customers 

we are exposed to product liability and product warranty claims relating to the products we sell that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows because we do not have direct control over the quality of products manufactured or supplied to us by our vendors and because we selfinsure for such product liability and warranty claims we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods regardless of the ultimate outcome claims of this nature as well as mandatory or voluntary recalls of defective products we have sold could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in the products we stock and in our reputation 

our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 

an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies cost reductions and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of improvements to our management information systems to improve operations such as inventory replenishment systems merchandise ordering transportation and receipt processing our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our systems 

our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer employee or vendor data or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect such data 

while we have invested heavily in the protection of our information technology and maintain what we believe are adequate security controls over individually identifiable customer employee and vendor data provided to us a breakdown or a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could nonetheless occur and have a material adverse effect on our reputation operating results and financial condition such a breakdown or breach could also materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such risks also the regulatory environment relating to our obligation to protect such sensitive data is becoming stricter a material failure on our part to comply with these evolving regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits 

if the domestic or international supply chain for our products is disrupted our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted 

we source the approximately 40000 products we stock and sell from approximately 7000 domestic and international vendors we source many of those products directly from foreign manufacturers political or financial instability among suppliers trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain the global recession from which we are 

 

  

  

 

 

beginning to recover and the credit crisis that began in late 2008 and continues to some extent have adversely affected the operations and financial stability of some of our vendors by reducing their sales and restricting their access to capital we may have to replace some of our smaller vendors and some of our vendors may not be able to fulfill their financial obligations to us or to do so in a timely manner 

our inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate ourselves from competitors 

part of our expansion strategy includes continued differentiation from competitors to better distinguish our product offering we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected brand names the inability to effectively and efficiently manage the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial results 

changes in existing or new laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

laws and regulations at both the state and federal levels change frequently and can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and our merchandise vendors any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation that affects employmentlabor trade product safety transportationlogistics energy costs health care tax or environmental issues could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations

who we serve 

we serve homeowners renters and commercial business customers homeowners and renters primarily consist of doityourself diy customers and doitforme difm customers who utilize our installed sales programs as well as others buying for personal and family use commercial business customers include those who work in the construction repairremodel commercial and residential property management and business maintenance professions 

to meet customers’ varying home improvement needs we offer a complete line of products and services for home decorating maintenance repair remodeling and property maintenance we offer home improvement products in the following categories appliances lumber paint flooring building materials millwork lawn  landscape products fashion plumbing hardware lighting tools seasonal living rough plumbing outdoor power equipment cabinets  countertops nursery rough electrical home environment home organization and windows  walls 

our market 

using the most recent comprehensive data available which is from 2007 we estimate the size of the us home improvement market to be approximately 695 billion annually comprised of 535 billion of product demand and 160 billion of installed labor opportunity during that period data from a variety of primary and secondary sources including trade associations government publications industry participants and other sources was analyzed as the basis for our estimate this data captures a wide range of categories relevant to our business including major appliances and garden supplies based on the most recently available data we believe that the size of the us home improvement market decreased by more than 7 in 2008 

the home improvement retailing business includes many competitors we compete with a number of traditional hardware plumbing electrical and home supply retailers as well as other chains of warehouse home improvement stores and lumberyards in most of our trade areas in addition we compete with respect to some of our products with general merchandise stores mail order firms warehouse clubs and online retailers the principal competitive factors are customer service location price product and brand selection and name recognition 

there are many variables that impact consumer demand for the products and services we offer key indicators we monitor include employment real disposable personal income housing turnover and home ownership levels we also monitor demographic and societal trends that are indicators of home improvement industry growth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

currently all of these indicators suggest continued weakness in consumer demand in this economic environment we seek to balance our longterm growth plans with a nearterm focus on conserving capital and maintaining liquidity 

our stores 

new store expansion 

we opened 115 new stores in fiscal 2008 including five canadian stores located primarily in the greater toronto area our 2008 store openings included three primary prototypes 117000squarefoot 117k and 103000squarefoot 103k stores for large markets and a 94000squarefoot 94k store to serve smaller markets the following table illustrates our store expansion over the last three years 

 

we expect to open 60 to 70 new stores in fiscal 2009 which includes continued expansion in canada as well as our first stores in monterrey mexico our fiscal 2009 store openings will be comprised primarily of 117k 103k and 94k stores as we continue our expansion and strive to maximize our return on investment we consider market demographics and land availability among other factors to determine the appropriate prototype for a particular market the reduction in store openings in 2009 as compared to 2008 reflects the challenging current economic environment 

investments in existing stores 

during fiscal 2008 we continued our long history of investing in our existing stores to enhance the shopping experience for our retail and commercial business customers while at the same time rationalizing our capital spending on these efforts to ensure appropriate return on investment these efforts included relamping our stores at regular intervals to ensure they remained bright adding new displays improving pointofsale and directional signage adding more product selection repainting our building exteriors and restriping our parking lots we categorize our merchandisingrelated investments in our stores as resets or remerchandising 

resets 

resets are necessary to keep our stores fresh with new and innovative products updated fashions and compelling displays these resets can involve changing products displays and vendors however they generally do not require major changes in the store we conducted hundreds of resets in fiscal 2008 with each reset typically being performed across most or all of our stores 

remerchandising 

in fiscal 2008 we completed the remerchandising of 79 of our earlier format stores to make them more closely resemble our most current store prototypes these remerchandising efforts were focused on moving entire departments improving adjacencies and enhancing the shopability within the appliances cabinets  countertops flooring fashion plumbing paint lighting and home style  organization departments we also replaced or refurbished all of our selling centers as well as returns and customer service areas of these stores all new interior graphics signage and wayfinding materials were also added to increase shopability and brighten the atmosphere finally self checkout was included as a part of these remerchandising efforts for locations where it had not previously been installed these enhancements enable our stores to deliver stronger sales by offering our customers a bestinclass shopping experience 

serving our customers 

 

our vision is to be our customers’ first choice for home improvement to achieve this vision we continue to focus on excellent customer service everyday low prices new lower price and innovative operational merchandising marketing and distribution 

 

  

  

strategies we believe customers’ perceptions of the quality of service determine a retailer’s success or failure therefore we are always looking for ways to improve our level of service optimize store labor and drive instore process improvement build our talent pool and enhance our sales culture the following are several key initiatives we believe will continue to support our growth and success going forward 

everyday low prices 

our customers do not have to wait for a sale to find a great value we offer low prices every day our promise to customers is that if they find a lower everyday or advertised price on an identical stock product at a local competitor we will not just match that price but we will beat it by 10 

specialty sales 

our specialty sales initiatives include installed sales special order sales and commercial business customer sales   we recognize the opportunity that our specialty sales initiatives represent and the importance of these businesses to our longterm growth however in the current economic environment demand for installed sales and special order sales offerings has declined due to hesitancy by consumers to make big ticket discretionary purchases 

installed sales 

we offer installation services in over 40 categories with flooring millwork and cabinets  countertops generating the highest sales our installed sales model which includes the separation of selling and administrative tasks allows our sales associates to maintain their focus on project selling while project managers ensure that the details related to an installation job are efficiently executed installed sales which includes both product and labor accounted for approximately 6 of total sales in fiscal 2008 

special order sales 

our special order sales product offerings provide our customers the opportunity to select a wider assortment of product options beyond the approximately 40000 we carry in our stores we are making the special order sales process easier for customers by providing more product displays and electronic product catalogs in our stores as well as on lowescom we continue to enhance integrated design tools and ordering systems storewide in order for customers to envision projects as well as to efficiently receive quotations and complete an order 

our special order express initiative is intended to allow for faster and more efficient delivery of special order products to customers while at the same time provide the ability to better manage our inventory investment under this approach certain items that do not have enough individual store demand to be economically stocked in all stores but have sizeable demand across a group of stores will be kept on hand in our distribution centers this allows for fast shipment to our stores or in some cases direct shipment to a customer’s home our special order express initiative allows us to balance quickly satisfying customers’ needs with a desire to minimize our inventory investment we will continue to refine and enhance this initiative in fiscal 2009 

commercial business customers 

growth in total sales to commercial business customers continued to outpace the company average in fiscal 2008 our focus remains being a valued business partner to our customers who work in the construction repairremodel commercial and residential property management and business maintenance professions because we understand the challenges of the current economic environment and the importance of timeliness to these customers we continue to evaluate and tailor our product service and competitive offerings to best meet the needs of these customers these programs focus on instock and special order merchandise contractor packs business credit pricing for larger projects our lowesforproscom dedicated business website and convenience services such as fast ordering and 7day delivery 

lowescom

building our brand 

 

customers want lowe’s to serve as a resource for products and projects to help them repair maintain and enhance their homes and communities our marketing and advertising programs communicated via television radio newspaper magazine direct mail 

 

  

  

sponsorships internet and instore programs all play a critical role in cultivating this emotional and rational connection with the consumer through an extensive understanding of our customers and their needs and expectations we deliver a message that will develop loyal customer relationships and differentiate lowe’s from other home improvement sources 

with the downturn in the economy that accelerated in the second half of fiscal 2008 consumers became even more value conscious as a result we adjusted our communication to ensure that we presented value to consumers even more clearly given our platform of everyday low prices 

new lower price 

our ongoing new lower price initiative which has been in place for several years highlights price reductions on products that consumers want to purchase everyday in the current economic environment we are emphasizing this initiative to pass along cost savings in order to deliver enhanced value to our customers 

media investment 

a combination of national broadcast and cable television supplemented by a number of national magazines internet banner advertising and search investment provides the platform for building brand awareness we complement the national media investment in key markets by local television and radio schedules 

in the past newspaper circulars and rop run of press served as the primary communication vehicle for retail price and item messaging and regularly featured lowe’s breadth of product selection customer services and everyday low price positioning however given the accelerating erosion in newspaper subscription bases and readership we have invested time and money in alternative retail price and item advertising delivery vehicles we are testing new online vehicles that deliver to a large audience at a low cost we believe this is more efficient and effective advertising in today’s fast paced and online world 

major promotional events receive network radio support with a local radio overlay in key markets we promote internet access to lowe’s retail advertising through the use of online banner and circular advertising in many cases we feature our entire circular online within the online advertising section of major market newspapers this is a location of increasing readership as more households read their newspaper on line the lowe’s brand has also been successfully integrated into television programming including the oprah winfrey show and rate my space on hgtv 

direct to consumer marketing 

we continue to refine programs to respond to the changing needs and lifestyles of consumers through innovative database technology we create direct mail campaigns based on precise criteria such as purchase activity affinity group subscriptions household demographics regional weather patterns optin email requests and even consumers who are preparing to move are in the process of moving or have recently moved into a new home “new movers” 

despite the housing slowdown new movers continue to spend considerably more on their previous and new homes than the average homeowner this past year we executed our new movers program through the us postal service’s change of address program as the renter population grew in 2008 we quickly remixed our focus of this new movers program to be more inclusive of this customer group as well as the new opportunities associated with repairing and renovating foreclosed homes that have been repurchased 

additionally optin email programs line up with lowe’s affinity and education programs lowe’s creative ideas for home and garden® lowe’s creative ideas for outdoor living™ and lowe’s creative ideas for woodworkers™ the lowe’s creative ideas magazine subscription base is now as large as many major magazines and has become a very efficient way to market lowe’s to a group of our most valuable customers 

membership in the team lowe’s racing fan club and participation in the buildngrow children’s clinics creates another level of engagement with our consumers both inside lowe’s stores and beyond our walls each of these varying acquisition and retention programs creates loyal lowe’s customers 

multicultural marketing 

lowe’s reaches its diverse communities and customer base in various manners including multicultural marketing and outreach to hispanic africanamerican and asian customers for these cultural groups lowe’s executes advertising across many media including television radio print and on line in both english and native languages some of the unique efforts include la cancha lowe’s lowe’s hispanic mobile marketing program providing fun to families at key soccer events across the country lowe’s sponsorship of the ciaa’s annual basketball tournament the nation’s oldest black athletic conference consisting of ten historically africanamerican institutions of higher education that has blossomed into one of largest collegiate postseason tournaments in the country the national lowe’s sponsorship of the piolin and monique radio programs targeted to hispanic and african american listeners and lowe’s new chinese korean and vietnamese language websites offering a new way for many asian consumers to learn more about home improvement 

 

  

  

team lowe’s racing 

nascar remains an important part of building our brand we are the proud sponsor of jimmie johnson three time nascar sprint® cup series champion the 48 car and lowe’s motor speedway we also host hospitality events at various sites throughout the racing season leveraging and further building membership in the team lowe’s racing fan club in 2008 we continued to sponsor adrian fernandez and fernandez racing to field the 15 car in the american le mans series whose fan base is very different than that of nascar going to market through both the 48 and 15 teams helps us to connect with a broad base of customers through one of america’s favorite sports – auto racing

 item 1a  risk factors 

we are exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties most are general risks and uncertainties applicable to all retailers but some are more particular to retailers serving the home improvement industry our operations may also be affected by factors that are either not currently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial to our business we describe below some of the specific known factors that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations all forwardlooking statements made by us in this annual report to the securities and exchange commission on form 10k in our annual report to shareholders and in our subsequently filed quarterly and current reports to the securities and exchange commission as well as in our press releases and other public communications are qualified by the risks described below 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy 

general economic factors and other conditions both domestically and internationally may adversely affect the us economy the global economy and our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of flat economic growth or recession volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of credit to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income higher rates of unemployment higher consumer debt levels increasing fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters acts of terrorism and developments in the war against terrorism in asia and the middle east 

the deep global recession that officially began in the us in december 2007 and the financialcredit crisis that has led to the collapse government bailout or acquisition of weakened major financial institutions have had and will continue to have significant adverse effects on our results of operations rising unemployment reduced consumer confidence and reduced access to credit have combined to lead to sharply reduced consumer spending particularly by our customers on many of the discretionary bigticket items we sell that tend to be larger home improvement project driven consumer confidence and willingness to spend on discretionary items remains low and our sales and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected throughout the current fiscal year and if the recovery from this deep recessionary period and financial crisis is unusually gradual and prolonged as some are predicting potentially beyond 

adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable store sales 

sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by housing turnover and activity level of home improvement projects sharply declining home prices that are expected to continue to decline in 2009 increasing mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates reduction in the availability of mortgage financing rising interest rates on variable rate mortgages and significantly lower housing 

 

  

  

turnover have limited and may continue to limit consumers’ discretionary spending particularly on discretionary items and affect their confidence level leading to further reduced spending on home improvement projects the impact of these economic factors specific to the home improvement industry is exacerbated by rising unemployment in a weak job market 

unseasonable weather conditions and adverse weather events can negatively affect our total sales and comparable store sales 

if weather conditions are uncharacteristic of the time of year during any season they can hurt our sales by making it difficult to sell seasonal merchandise although the impact of unseasonable weather conditions is mitigated somewhat by the broad geographic dispersion of our stores they continue to be a significant risk to the overall performance of our business particularly when they occur across a broad region of the us adverse weather events such as a prolonged and widespread drought can hurt our sales of particular products as well 

our store expansion and relocation strategy depends upon our ability to successfully open and operate new stores each year 

our growth in total sales depends not only on a recovery from the current recessionary period but also to a substantial degree on successfully and costeffectively implementing our ongoing expansion program we scaled back our expansion plans significantly last year and plan to scale back even further in the current fiscal year in response to the weak environment as we expand further we must adapt our merchandising marketing and distribution initiatives to new markets both domestically and as we continue to expand into canada and mexico we also plan to increase the number of our stores in markets in which we currently operate our ability to open additional stores depends in large measure upon our ability to locate and acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings in the formats with which we operate may affect our ability to open new stores in some markets as we develop more new stores in metropolitan markets we may incur increased costs to remediate environmental pollution on some of the sites we are redeveloping that was caused by previous owners of those sites our ability to continue to expand our operations depends also on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees if we are unable to open new stores at the rate we currently plan and staff them with qualified employees the growth in our sales and our competitive position could be adversely affected 

if we fail to hire train and retain qualified managers sales associates and other employees we could lose sales to our competitors 

customers’ perceptions of the quality of service provided by employees can determine any retailer’s success or failure if we fail to attract train and retain qualified managers and sales associates our financial performance could be adversely impacted consumers shopping for goods and services for home improvement projects expect to have sales associates serving them who are knowledgeable about product categories located throughout our stores 

excessive turnover which has historically been high among employees in entrylevel or parttime positions increases the risk that sales associates will not have the training and experience needed to provide competitive high quality customer service 

our success in serving the needs of commercial business customers is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified commercial sales specialists 

commercial business customers in the home improvement industry require that we have welltrained commercial sales specialists at our project desks by doing so we can better serve the needs of this customer on a consistent basis our commercial sales specialists have a great depth of knowledge about the products needed by commercial business customers if we fail to staff our project desks with experienced and knowledgeable employees we run the risk that we will lose commercial business customers 

we have many competitors who if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively could take sales and market share from us 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the competitive environment in which we operate is particularly challenging during recessionary periods with heavy promotions particularly of discretionary items and competitor closings the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could affect our financial performance moreover changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our expected results 

an unusual number of product liability or breach of warranty claims for defective products could expose us to expensive claims and damage our standing with customers 

we are exposed to product liability and product warranty claims relating to the products we sell that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows because we do not have direct control over the quality of products manufactured or supplied to us by our vendors and because we selfinsure for such product liability and warranty claims we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods regardless of the ultimate outcome claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in the products we stock and in our reputation 

 

  

  

our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 

an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies cost reductions and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of improvements to our management information systems to improve operations such as inventory replenishment systems merchandise ordering transportation and receipt processing our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our systems 

if the domestic or international supply chain for our products is disrupted our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted 

we source the approximately 40000 products we stock and sell from approximately 7000 domestic and international vendors we source many of those products directly from foreign manufacturers political or financial instability among suppliers trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain the current global recession and credit crisis are adversely affecting the operations and financial stability of some of our vendors by reducing their sales and restricting their access to capital we may have to replace some of our smaller vendors and some of our vendors may not be able to fulfill their financial obligations to us or to do so in a timely manner 

our inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate ourselves from competitors 

part of our expansion strategy includes continued differentiation from competitors to better distinguish our product offering we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected brand names the inability to effectively and efficiently manage the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial results

the home improvement retailing business includes many competitors we compete with a number of traditional hardware plumbing electrical and home supply retailers as well as other chains of warehouse home improvement stores and lumberyards in most of our trade areas in addition we compete with respect to some of our products with general merchandise stores mail order firms warehouse clubs and online retailers the principal competitive factors are customer service location price product and brand selection and name recognition 

our stores

our vision is to be our customers’ first choice for home improvement to achieve this vision we continue to focus on excellent customer service everyday low prices and innovative operational merchandising marketing and distribution strategies we believe customers’ perceptions of the quality of service determine a retailer’s success or failure therefore we are always looking for ways to improve our level of service optimize store labor and drive instore process improvement build our talent pool and enhance our sales culture the following are several key initiatives we believe will continue to support our growth and success going forward 

everyday low prices 

our customers do not have to wait for a sale to find a great value we offer low prices every day our promise to customers is that if they find a lower everyday or advertised price on an identical stock product at a local competitor we will not just match that price but we will beat it by 10 

specialty sales 

we recognize the opportunity that our specialty sales initiatives represent and the importance of these businesses to our longterm growth our specialty sales initiatives include three major categories installed sales special order sales and commercial business customer sales internally referred to as the “big 3” in addition our effort to utilize ecommerce to drive sales and conveniently provide product information to customers is managed by our specialty sales group 

installed sales 

we offer installation services in over 40 categories with flooring millwork and cabinets  countertops generating the highest sales our installed sales model which includes the separation of selling and administrative tasks allows our sales associates to shift their focus to project selling while project managers ensure that the details related to an installation job are efficiently executed installed sales which includes both product and labor has proven to be a successful service initiative accounting for approximately 6 of total sales in fiscal 2007 we also continue to refine our offerings including an ongoing test of an inhome selling model for certain installed sales categories 

special order sales 

our special order sales product offerings provide our customers the opportunity to select a wider assortment of product options beyond the approximately 40000 we carry in our stores we are making the special order sales process easier for customers by providing more product displays and electronic product catalogs in our stores as well as on lowescom we continue to enhance integrated design tools and ordering systems storewide in order for customers to envision projects as well as to efficiently receive quotations and complete an order 

special order kiosks whether electronic or literaturebased are available in various departments throughout the store for facilitating special orders in addition to what is made available on lowescom these kiosks facilitate the ability of customers to view product pictures and special order hundreds of thousands of products 

our special order express initiative is intended to allow for faster and more efficient delivery of special order products to customers while at the same time manage our inventory investment under this approach certain items that do not have enough individual store demand to be economically stocked in all stores but have sizeable demand across a group of stores will be kept on hand in our distribution centers this allows for fast shipment to our stores or in some cases direct shipment to a customer’s home our special order express initiative allows us to balance quickly satisfying customers’ needs with a desire to minimize our inventory investment we will continue to refine and enhance this initiative in fiscal 2008 

commercial business customers 

growth in total sales to commercial business customers outpaced the company average in fiscal 2007 our focus is to continue offering exceptional service to repairremodel residential property management and business maintenance customers because we understand that time is money for these businesses we continue to focus on ways to tailor our product and service offerings for these customers to quickly find what they need when they need it 

in order to enable commercial business customers to quickly access the products they need our stores are merchandised with highvolume takewith product appropriate for the season we continue to evaluate and expand our contractor packs which are economical quantities of the items commercial business customers use most in addition commercial business customers can phone or fax their orders in advance or order online for pickup the same day or the next day depending on the time of day the order is placed for added convenience we deliver to job sites seven days a week in most areas we want to be a valued business partner to commercial business customers so we ensure our lowesforproscom site features uptodate articles job estimators and business forms enewsletters statistics and other vital information that commercial business customers can use for their business

in addition to offering a wide selection of national brand name merchandise we are committed to building longterm value for lowe’s through the development of exclusive proprietary brands where we focus on delivering the best quality the best value and recognizably differentiated products to meet our customers’ needs and wants

distribution network 

to efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain instock levels we own and operate 13 highlyautomated regional distribution centers rdcs the rdcs are strategically located in north carolina 2 georgia indiana pennsylvania texas california ohio florida connecticut wyoming illinois and oregon on average each rdc serves 118 stores we expect to open an additional rdc in pittston pennsylvania in fiscal 2008 we also lease a thirdparty distribution facility to serve our canadian stores 

we operate 14 flatbed distribution centers fdcs to distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber boards panel products irrigation pipe vinyl sidings ladders and building materials we own 12 and lease two of these fdcs we expect to open an additional fdc in purvis mississippi in fiscal 2008 

we also operate four facilities to support our import business special order sales and internet fulfillment we own two and lease two 

  

  

of these facilities in addition we utilize three thirdparty transload facilities these facilities do not hold inventory but are the first point of receipt for imported products the transload facilities sort and allocate products to rdcs based on individual store demand and forecasts 

on average in fiscal 2007 over 72 of the stock merchandise we purchased was shipped through our distribution network while the remaining portion was shipped directly to stores from our vendors 

building our brand 

customers want lowe’s to serve as a resource for products and projects to help them maintain and enhance their homes and communities our marketing and advertising programs communicated via television radio newspaper magazine direct mail sponsorships internet and instore programs all play a critical role in cultivating this emotional and rational connection with the consumer through an extensive understanding of our customers and their needs and expectations we deliver a message that will develop loyal customer relationships and differentiate lowe’s from other home improvement sources 

media investment 

a combination of national broadcast and cable television supplemented by an array of national magazines and internet banner advertising provides the platform for building brand awareness we complement the national media investment in key markets by local television and radio schedules newspaper circulars and rop run of press serve as the primary communication vehicle for retail messaging and regularly feature lowe’s breadth of product selection customer services and everyday low price positioning major promotional events receive network radio support with a local radio overlay in key markets we promote internet access to lowe’s retail advertising through the use of online banner advertising the lowe’s brand has also been successfully integrated into television programming including the oprah winfrey show rate my space on hgtv and indoors out on the diy network 

direct to consumer marketing 

we continue to refine programs to respond to the changing needs and lifestyles of consumers through innovative database technology we create direct mail campaigns based on precise criteria such as purchase activity affinity group subscriptions household demographics regional weather patterns and even consumers who are preparing to move are in the process of moving or have recently moved into a new home “new movers” despite the housing slowdown new movers continue to spend considerably more on their previous and new homes than the average homeowner this behavior has helped guide the decision to further invest in this particular consumer base over the course of the next several years as a result lowe’s has finalized a twoyear agreement with the united states postal service’s change of address program and will add this to its multidimensional portfolio of direct mail tactics that speak to the highly engaged new movers additionally optin email programs line up with lowe’s affinity and education programs lowe’s creative ideas for home and garden ® lowe’s creative ideas for outdoor living ™ and lowe’s creative ideas for woodworkers ™ membership in the team lowe’s racing fan club and participation in the buildngrow children’s clinics creates another level of engagement with our consumers both inside lowe’s stores and beyond our walls each of these varying acquisition and retention programs creates loyal lowe’s customers 

multicultural marketing 

lowe’s reaches its diverse communities and customer base in various manners including multicultural marketing and outreach to hispanic africanamerican and asian customers for these cultural groups lowe’s executes advertising across many media including television radio and print in both english and native languages some of the unique efforts include la cancha lowe’s lowe’s hispanic mobile marketing program providing fun to families at key soccer events across the country lowe’s sponsorship of the ciaa’s annual basketball tournament the nation’s oldest black athletic conference consisting of ten historically africanamerican institutions of higher education that has blossomed into one of largest collegiate postseason tournaments in the country and lowe’s new chinese korean and vietnamese language websites offering a new way for many asian consumers to learn more about home improvement 

team lowe’s racing 

as one of the world’s fastest growing sports nascar is an important part of building our brand we are the proud sponsor of jimmie johnson backtoback nascar sprint® cup series champion the 48 car and lowe’s motor speedway we also host hospitality events at various sites throughout the racing season leveraging and further building membership in the team lowe’s racing fan club in 2007 we continued to foster our relationship with adrian fernandez who drove in the nascar busch® series race in mexico city for lowe’s in addition we teamed up with adrian fernandez and fernandez racing to field the 15 car in the american le mans series

information systems 

we are continuously assessing and upgrading our information systems in an effort to support growth augment new sales initiatives control costs and enable better decisionmaking during the last several years we have made substantial investments in developing and purchasing new computer systems 

we have a pointofsale system electronic bar code scanning system various design systems a wired and wireless network and dual unix servers in each of our stores these systems provide the stores with realtime perpetual inventory information support all instore selling support labor planning and management and provide support for a variety of store administrative functions in addition these store systems provide the customer support center organizations with information needed to support the stores key customer support center groups using this information include inventory replenishment finance human resources and merchandising store information is communicated to the customer support centers central computers via a terrestrial based mpls network with backup provided by a satellitebased wide area network these corporate systems provide customer checkout with automated credit card and

 item 1a – risk factors 

we are exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties most are general risks and uncertainties applicable to all retailers but some are more particular to retailers serving the home improvement industry our operations may also be affected by factors that are either not currently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial to our business we describe below some of the specific known factors that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations all forwardlooking statements made by us in this annual report to the securities and exchange commission on form 10k in our annual report to shareholders and in our subsequently filed quarterly and current reports to the securities and exchange commission as well as in our press releases and other public communications are qualified by the risks described below 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy 

general economic factors and other conditions both domestically and internationally may adversely affect the united states economy the global economy and our financial performance these include but are not limited to periods of flat economic growth or recession volatility andor lack of liquidity from time to time in us and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability andor higher cost of credit to lowe’s and its customers slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income higher rates of unemployment higher consumer debt levels increasing fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices natural disasters acts of terrorism and developments in the war against terrorism in asia and the middle east 

adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable store sales 

sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by housing turnover and activity level of home improvement projects many of those sales are to consumers who are either doing the home improvement projects themselves or using our installation services but many others are to professionals who are in the business of providing construction renovation and property maintenance services rising interestrates on variable rate mortgages increasing mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates reduction in the availability of mortgage financing and consumer credit lower housing turnover homeprice depreciation and increased heating and gas expenses could limit consumers’ discretionary spending and affect their confidence level and could lead to further reduced spending on home improvement projects the impact of these economic factors specific to the home improvement industry would be exacerbated by a weak job market 

unseasonable weather conditions and adverse weather events can negatively affect our total sales and comparable store sales 

if weather conditions are uncharacteristic of the time of year during any season they can hurt our sales by making it difficult to sell seasonal merchandise although the impact of unseasonable weather conditions is mitigated somewhat by the broad geographic dispersion of our stores they continue to be a significant risk to the overall performance of our business particularly when they occur 

  

  

across a broad region of the united states adverse weather events such as a prolonged and widespread drought can hurt our sales of particular products as well 

our store expansion and relocation strategy depends upon our ability to successfully open and operate new stores each year 

our growth in total sales depends to a substantial degree on successfully and costeffectively implementing our ongoing expansion program we must adapt our merchandising marketing and distribution initiatives to new markets both domestically and as we continue to expand into canada and mexico we also plan to increase the number of our stores in markets in which we currently operate our ability to open additional stores depends in large measure upon our ability to locate and acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings in the formats with which we operate may affect our ability to open new stores in some markets as we develop more new stores in metropolitan markets we may incur increased costs to remediate environmental pollution on some of the sites we are redeveloping that was caused by previous owners of those sites increased real estate construction and development costs could also limit our growth opportunities our ability to continue to expand our operations depends also on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees if we are unable to open new stores at the rate we currently plan and staff them with qualified employees the growth in our sales and our competitive position could be adversely affected 

if we fail to hire train and retain qualified managers sales associates and other employees we could lose sales to our competitors 

customers’ perceptions of the quality of service provided by employees can determine any retailer’s success or failure competition for qualified store managers and sales associates among retailers in the home improvement retailing business is intense and if we fail to attract train and retain qualified managers and sales associates our financial performance could be adversely impacted consumers shopping for goods and services for home improvement projects expect to have sales associates serving them who are knowledgeable about product categories located throughout our stores 

excessive turnover which has historically been high among employees in entrylevel or parttime positions increases the risk that sales associates will not have the training and experience needed to provide competitive high quality customer service 

our success in serving the needs of commercial business customers is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified commercial sales specialists 

commercial business customers in the home improvement industry require that we have welltrained commercial sales specialists at our project desks by doing so we can better serve the needs of this customer on a consistent basis our commercial sales specialists have a great depth of knowledge about the products needed by commercial business customers if we fail to staff our project desks with experienced and knowledgeable employees we run the risk that we will lose commercial business customers 

we have many competitors who if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively could take sales and market share from us 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could affect our financial performance moreover unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our expected results 

an unusual number of product liability or breach of warranty claims for defective products could expose us to expensive claims and damage our standing with our customers 

we are exposed to product liability and product warranty claims relating to the products we sell that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows because we do not have direct control over the quality of products manufactured or supplied to us by our vendors and because we selfinsure for such product liability and warranty claims we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods regardless of the ultimate outcome claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in the products we stock and in our reputation 

our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 

an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies cost reductions and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of improvements to our management information systems to improve operations such as inventory replenishment systems merchandise ordering transportation and receipt processing our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our systems 

if the domestic and international supply chain for our products is disrupted our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted 

we source the approximately 40000 products we stock and sell from approximately 7000 domestic and international vendors we source many of those products directly from foreign manufacturers political or financial instability among suppliers trade 

  

  

restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain 

our inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate ourselves from competitors 

part of our expansion strategy includes continued differentiation from competitors to better distinguish our product offering we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected brand names the inability to effectively and efficiently manage the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial results

investments in existing stores 

during fiscal 2006 we continued our long history of investing in our existing stores to create a more inviting shopping experience for our retail and commercial business customers this included relamping our stores at regular intervals to ensure they remain bright adding new displays improving pointofsale and directional signage adding more product selection repainting our building exteriors and restriping our parking lots we categorize our merchandisingrelated investments in our stores as follows 

resets 

resets are necessary to drive comparable store sales increases and keep our stores fresh with new and innovative products these resets involve the replacement of a particular product or vendor and do not require major changes in the store we conducted hundreds of resets in fiscal 2006 

remerchandising 

in fiscal 2006 we completed the remerchandising of 150 of our earlier format stores to make them more closely resemble our most current store prototypes these remerchandising efforts focused on moving entire departments improving adjacencies and enhancing the shopability within the appliances cabinets  countertops flooring fashion plumbing paint wallswindows lighting home organization lumber and building materials departments in addition we replaced or refurbished all of our selling centers including the returns and customer service areas of these stores all new interior graphics signage and wayfinding materials were also added to increase shopability and brighten the atmosphere finally we installed self checkout in all 150 of our remerchandised stores we were able to remerchandise these stores with minimal disruption to our customers we continuously make these investments to maintain our bestinclass stores these enhancements enable our stores to continue to deliver the sales performance we expect and also offer customers the shopping experience and environment they deserve 

serving our customers 

our vision is to be our customers’ first choice for home improvement to achieve this vision we continue to focus on excellent customer service everyday low prices and innovative operational merchandising marketing and distribution strategies we believe customers’ perceptions of the quality of service determine a retailer’s success or failure therefore we are always looking for ways to improve our level of service optimize store labor and drive instore process improvement build our talent pool and enhance our sales culture the following are several key initiatives we believe will continue to support our growth and success going forward 

specialty sales 

we recognize the opportunity that our specialty sales initiatives represent and the importance of these businesses to our longterm growth our specialty sales initiatives include three major categories installed sales special order sales and commercial business customer sales internally referred to as the “big 3” in addition our effort to utilize ecommerce to drive sales and conveniently provide product information to customers is managed by our specialty sales group 

installed sales 

we offer installation services in over 40 categories with flooring millwork and cabinets  countertops generating the highest sales our installed sales model which includes the separation of selling and administrative tasks allows our sales associates to shift their focus to project selling while project managers ensure that the details related to an installation job are efficiently executed installed sales which includes both product and labor has proven to be a successful service initiative accounting for approximately 6 of total sales in fiscal 2006 we also continue to refine our offerings including an ongoing test of an inhome selling model for certain installed sales categories 

special order sales 

our special order sales product offerings provide our customers the opportunity to select a wider assortment of product options beyond the approximately 40000 we carry in our stores we are making the special order sales process easier for customers by providing more product displays and electronic product catalogs in our stores as well as on lowescom we continue to enhance integrated design tools and ordering systems storewide in order for customers to envision projects as well as to efficiently receive quotations and complete an order 

special order kiosks are available in departments such as appliances wallswindows lighting millwork hardware building materials seasonal living fashion plumbing and tools for facilitating special orders in addition to what is made available on lowescom whether t hese kiosks are electronic or literature based all facilitate the ability of customers to view product pictures and special order over a million products and parts 

our flexible fulfillment initiative is intended to allow for faster and more efficient delivery of special order products to customers while at the same time manage our inventory investment under this approach certain items that do not have enough individual store demand to be economically stocked in all stores but have sizeable demand across a group of stores will be kept on hand in our distribution centers this allows for fast shipment to our stores or in some cases direct shipment to a customer’s home our flexible fulfillment initiative allows us to balance quickly satisfying customers’ needs with a desire to minimize our inventory investment we will continue to refine and enhance this fulfillment option in fiscal 2007

distribution network 

to efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain instock levels we own and operate 11 highlyautomated regional distribution centers rdcs the rdcs are strategically located in north carolina 2 georgia 1 indiana 1 pennsylvania 1 texas 1 california 1 ohio 1 florida 1 connecticut 1 and wyoming 1 on average each rdc serves 126 stores we expect to open additional rdcs in rockford illinois and lebanon oregon in fiscal 2007 and are planning for an additional rdc in fiscal 2008 

we also operate 13 flatbed distribution centers to distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber boards panel products irrigation pipe vinyl sidings ladders and building materials we own 12 of these flatbed distribution centers and we lease one flatbed distribution center we expect to open two additional flatbed distribution centers in fiscal 2007 

we also operate four facilities to support our import business special order sales and internet fulfillment we own two of these facilities and we lease two of these facilities in addition we utilize two thirdparty transload facilities these facilities do not hold inventory but are the first point of receipt for imported products the transload facilities sort and allocate products to rdcs based on individual store demand and forecasts

building our brand 

television radio newspaper magazine direct mail sponsorships internet and instore programs all play a critical role in helping us reach customers each marketing initiative is based on understanding customers in terms of demographics needs expectations insights and beliefs as these relate to the home home improvement and business 

broadcast  television radio 

we continued to utilize national television to build brand awareness and positioning we supplemented our national broadcast advertising in key markets with local television and radio national radio was used to support major promotional events throughout the year in particular during key holiday weekends like the fourth of july we also continued to foster relationships with cable network partners such as hgtv home and garden television bet black entertainment television and univision 

 

print  newspaper magazine 

we implemented an enhanced print plan in fiscal 2006 that included national magazine advertising and rop run of press newspaper ads circulars remained a critical avenue for reaching customers with our everyday low price message and wide product and service selection 

direct to consumer

our market 

we estimate the size of the us home improvement market to be approximately 725 billion annually 560 billion of product demand and 165 billion of installed labor opportunity data from a variety of primary and secondary sources including trade associations government publications industry participants and other sources was analyzed as the basis for our estimate this estimate includes import and export data and key enduse markets such as residential repair and remodeling and nonresidential construction and maintenance this data also includes a wide range of categories relevant to our business including major appliances and garden supplies 

as we continue to monitor economic data and the home improvement marketplace there are many indicators demonstrating continued strength in consumer demand for the products and services we offer the key indicators we monitor include personal income employment growth housing turnover and home ownership levels demographic and societal trends also remain supportive of home improvement industry growth 

 

 

 

  

the home improvement retailing business includes many competitors we compete with a number of traditional hardware plumbing electrical and home supply retailers as well as other chains of warehouse home improvement stores and lumberyards in most of our trade areas in addition we compete with respect to some of our products with discount stores mail order firms warehouse clubs and online retailers the principal competitive factors are customer service location price product and brand selection and name recognition 

information systems 

we are continuously assessing and upgrading our information systems in an effort to support growth augment new sales initiatives control costs and enable better decisionmaking during the last several years we have made a substantial investment in developing and purchasing new computer systems 

we have a pointofsale system electronic bar code scanning system various design systems a wired and wireless network and dual unix servers in each of our stores these systems provide the stores with realtime perpetual inventory information support all instore selling provide labor management and provide support for a variety of store administrative functions in addition these store systems provide the customer support center functions including inventory replenishment finance human resources and merchandising with information needed to support the stores store information is communicated to the customer support centers central computers via a terrestrial based mpls network with backup provided by a satellitebased wide area network these corporate systems provide customer checkout with automated credit card and check approval host a variety of centralized design and specialty order systems for the stores provide storebased perpetual inventory information provide sales performance reporting and support accurate processing of all store sales transactions in addition to the store and corporate office computing infrastructure we also have significant computing capacity at each rdc to support these highly automated facilities

 item 1a  risk factors 

we are exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties most are general risks and uncertainties applicable to all retailers but some are more particular to retailers serving the home improvement industry our operations may also be affected by factors that are either not currently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial to our business we describe below some of the specific known factors that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations all forwardlooking statements made by us in this annual report to the securities and exchange commission on form 10k in our annual report to shareholders and in our subsequently filed quarterly and current reports to the securities and exchange commission as well as in our press releases and other public communications are qualified by the risks described below 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy 

general economic factors and other conditions both domestically and internationally may adversely affect the united states the global economy and our financial performance including but not limited to acts of terrorism developments in the war against terrorism in asia and the middle east natural disasters increasing fuel and energy costs inflation or deflation of commodity prices recession consumer debt levels and the volatility of financial markets 

adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our net sales and comparable store sales 

sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by housing turnover and activity level of home improvement projects many of those sales are to consumers who are either doing the home improvement projects themselves or using our installation services but many others are to professionals who are in the business of providing construction renovation and property maintenance services rising interestrates reduction in the availability of credit increased heating and gas expenses slowing housing turnover and slowing homeprice appreciation could limit consumers’ discretionary spending or affect their confidence level and lead to reduced spending on home improvement projects the impact of these economic factors specific to the home improvement industry would be exacerbated by a weak job market 

unseasonable weather and adverse weather conditions can negatively affect our net sales and comparable store sales 

wet and cold weather particularly during the spring and early summer months of the year when many of the products we sell are designed for outdoor use are generally detrimental to our sales and can make it difficult to sell seasonal merchandise although the impact of adverse weather conditions is mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores unseasonable weather is a risk to the performance of our business in any given season or year 

our store expansion and relocation strategy depends upon our ability to successfully open relocate and operate new stores each year 

our growth in net sales depends to a substantial degree on successfully and costeffectively implementing our ongoing aggressive expansion program we must adapt our merchandising marketing and distribution initiatives to new markets both domestically and going forward in canada and mexico we also plan to increase the number of our stores in markets in which we currently operate our ability to open additional stores depends in large measure upon our ability to locate and acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings in the formats with which we operate may affect our ability to open new stores in some markets as we develop more new stores in metropolitan markets we may incur increased costs to remediate environmental pollution on some of the sites we are redeveloping that was caused by previous owners of those sites increased real estate construction and development costs could also limit our growth opportunities our ability to continue to expand our operations depends also on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees if we are unable to 

 

 

open new stores at the rate we currently plan to do so and staff them with qualified employees the growth in our sales and our competitive position could be adversely affected 

if we fail to hire train and retain qualified managers sales associates and other employees we could lose sales to our competitors 

customers’ perceptions of the quality of service provided by employees can determine any retailer’s success or failure competition for qualified store managers and sales associates among retailers in the home improvement retailing business is intense and if we fail to attract train and retain qualified managers and sales associates our financial performance could be adversely impacted consumers shopping for goods and services for home improvement projects expect to have sales associates serving them who are knowledgeable about product categories located throughout our stores 

excessive turnover which has historically been high among employees in entrylevel or parttime positions increases the risk that sales associates will not have the training and experience needed to provide competitive high quality customer service 

our commercial business customers demand a higher level of customer service that is challenging to meet on a consistent basis 

commercial business customers in the home improvement industry expect to have their business handled by commercial sales specialists with an even greater depth of knowledge about the products these customers need if we fail to staff our commercial sales desks with experienced and knowledgeable employees we run the risk that we will lose commercial business customers 

we have many competitors who if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively could take sales and market share from us 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could affect our financial performance moreover unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our expected results 

an unusual number of product liability or breach of warranty claims for defective products could expose us to expensive claims and damage our standing with our customers 

we are exposed to product liability and product warranty claims relating to the products we sell that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows because we do not have direct control over the quality of products manufactured or supplied to us by our vendors and because we selfinsure for such product liability and warranty claims we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods regardless of the ultimate outcome claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in the products we stock and in our reputation 

our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 

an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies cost reductions and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of improvements to our management information systems to improve operations such as inventory replenishment systems merchandise ordering transportation and receipt processing our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our systems 

if the domestic and international supply chain for the products we stock is disrupted our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted 

we source the approximately 40000 products we stock and sell from approximately 7000 domestic and international vendors we source many of those products directly from foreign manufacturers political or financial instability among suppliers trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain 

our inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate ourselves from competitors 

part of our expansion strategy includes continued differentiation from competitors to better distinguish our product offering we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected brand names the inability to effectively and efficiently manage the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial results

minor resets 

minor resets are necessary to drive comparable store sales increases and keep our stores fresh with new and innovative products these resets involve the replacement of a particular product or vendor and do not require major changes in the store we conducted hundreds of minor resets in 2005 

remerchandising 

in 2005 we completed the remerchandising of 179 of our earlier format stores to make them more closely resemble our most current store prototypes these remerchandising efforts focused on moving entire departments improving adjacencies and enhancing the shoppability within the cabinetry appliances paint fashion plumbing and flooring departments all new interior graphics signage and wayfinding materials were also added to increase shoppability and brighten the atmosphere we were able to remerchandise these stores with minimal disruption to our customers we continuously make these investments to maintain our bestinclass stores these enhancements enable our stores to continue to deliver the sales performance we expect and also offer our customers the shopping experience and environment they deserve 

serving our customers 

our vision is to be our customers’ first choice for home improvement to achieve this vision we continue to focus on excellent customer service everyday low prices and innovative operational merchandising marketing and distribution strategies we believe customers’ perceptions of the quality of service determine a retailer’s success or failure therefore we are always looking for ways to improve our level of service optimize store labor and drive instore process improvement build our talent pool and enhance our sales culture the following are several key initiatives that we believe will continue to support our growth and success going forward 

special order sales sos 

our special order product offering provides our customers the opportunity to select unique and expressive products beyond the approximately 40000 we carry in our stores we are making the sos process easier for our customers by enhancing ordering systems storewide providing easytouse customer interfaces integrated design tools and electronic product catalogs 

special order kiosks are available in departments such as appliances walls  windows fashion lighting millwork hardware seasonal living fashion plumbing and tools for facilitating special orders in addition to what is made available on lowescom whether t hese kiosks are electronic or literature based all facilitate the ability of the customer to special order 

our sos express initiative for fashion plumbing is an example where advances in technology have improved the product selection and order entry process and helped expedite delivery all of which make the special order process much more customerfriendly a centrally located distribution center ensures that delivery is available in three business days for most items an overnight delivery option is available for select items we plan to roll this integrated process out to other categories in the future 

installed sales 

we offer installation services in over 40 categories with flooring millwork and kitchen cabinets  countertops generating the highest sales our installed sales model which includes the separation of selling and administrative tasks allows our sales associates to shift their focus to project selling while project managers ensure that the details related to an installation job are efficiently executed installed sales which include both product and labor have proven to be a successful service initiative accounting for approximately 6 of total sales in fiscal 2005 

commercial business customer initiatives 

we continue to improve service to our commercial business customers on many different fronts because time is money for this important customer base we tailor our product and service offerings so that they can find what they want when they want it for example we stock contractor packs which are economical quantities of the items commercial business customers use most commercial business customers can phone or fax their order in advance and it will be ready for pickup the same day or the next day depending on the time of day the order is placed for added convenience we can deliver to job sites seven days a week in most areas lowesforproscom features articles job estimate and business forms enewsletters statistics and other vital information that commercial business customers can use in their business

product sourcing 

we source our products from approximately 7000 merchandise vendors worldwide with no single vendor accounting for more than six percent of total purchases management believes that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all our products where product specifications and customer preferences permit our global sourcing division purchases directly from foreign manufacturers avoiding thirdparty importers this provides savings for our customers and both brand building and gross margin improvement opportunities for lowe’s 

regional distribution centers rdc 

to efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain instock levels we own and operate 11 highlyautomated rdcs the rdcs are strategically located in north carolina 2 georgia 1 indiana 1 pennsylvania 1 texas 1 california 1 ohio 1 florida 1 connecticut 1 and wyoming 1 each rdc is capable of serving up to 140 of our stores

at the end of fiscal 2005 nearly 70 of the stock merchandise we purchase was shipped through our distribution network while the remaining portion was shipped directly to stores from our vendors as a part of our rapid response replenishment r3 initiative we are increasing the shipments of product through our rdc network and increasing the frequency of rdc deliveries to our stores our r3 initiative allows us to move safety stock out of our stores and into our rdc network by increasing the number of shipments to each store from our rdcs and reducing vendordirect deliveries we have enhanced our ability to quickly and efficiently flow product to stores in the quantities necessary to support demand 

 

building our brand 

television radio newspaper magazine direct mail sponsorships internet and instore programs all play a critical role in helping us reach our customers each marketing initiative is based on understanding customers in terms of demographics needs expectations insights and beliefs as these relate to the home and home improvement 

broadcast  television radio

print  newspaper magazine 

we implemented an enhanced print plan in fiscal 2005 that included national magazine advertising and rop run of press newspaper ads circulars remained a critical avenue for reaching our customers with our everyday low price message and wide product and service selection 

direct to consumer

our market 

w e estimate the size of the us home improvement market to be approximately 700 billion 550 billion of which comprises product demand and 150 billion for the installed labor opportunity data from a variety of primary and secondary sources including trade associations government publications industry participants and other sources was analyzed as the basis for our estimate this estimate includes import and export data and key enduse markets such as residential repair and remodeling and nonresidential construction and maintenance this data also includes a wide range of categories relevant to our business including major appliances and garden supplies 

as we continue to monitor economic data and the home improvement marketplace there are many indicators demonstrating continued strength in consumer demand for the products and services we offer the key indicators that we monitor include personal income employment growth housing turnover and home ownership levels demographic and societal trends also remain supportive of home improvement industry growth 

 

 

 

  

the home improvement retailing business includes many competitors we compete with a number of traditional hardware plumbing electrical and home supply retailers as well as other chains of warehouse home improvement stores and lumberyards in most of our market areas in addition we compete with respect to some of our products with discount stores mail order firms and warehouse clubs the principal competitive factors are customer service location price product and brand selection and name recognition 

information systems 

we are continuously assessing and upgrading our information systems in an effort to support growth augment new sales initiatives control costs and enable better decisionmaking during the last several years we have made a substantial investment in developing and purchasing new computer systems 

we have a pointofsale system electronic bar code scanning system various design systems a wired and wireless network and dual unix servers in each of our stores these systems provide the stores with realtime perpetual inventory information support all instore selling functions provide labor management functions and provide support for a variety of store administrative functions store information is communicated to the customer support centers central computers via a terrestrial based frame relay network with backup provided by a satellitebased wide area network these systems provide customer checkout with automated credit card and check approval host a variety of centralized design and specialty order systems for the stores provide storebased perpetual inventory information provide sales performance reporting and support accurate processing of all store sales transactions these computers supply the customer support center functions with the information needed to support the stores including centralized inventory replenishment financial systems human resources merchandising systems and product information in 2005 we moved the entire customer support center centralized data processing environment into a new corporate data center this new center is a stateoftheart facility providing many additional failsafe features to improve system availability and mitigate risks associated with unplanned outages

 item 1a  risk factors 

we are exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties most are general risks and uncertainties applicable to all retailers but some are more particular to retailers serving the home improvement industry our operations may also be affected by factors that are either not currently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial to our business we describe below some of the specific known factors that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations all forwardlooking statements made by us in this annual report to the securities and exchange commission on form 10k in our annual report to shareholders and in our subsequently filed quarterly and current reports to the securities and exchange commission as well as in our press releases and other public communications are qualified by the risks described below 

our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy 

general economic factors and other conditions both domestically and internationally may adversely affect the united states the global economy and our financial performance including but not limited to acts of terrorism developments in the war against terrorism in asia and the middle east natural disasters increasing fuel and energy costs inflation recession consumer debt levels and the volatility of financial markets 

adverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our net sales and comparable store sales 

sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by activity level of home improvement projects many of those sales are to consumers who are either doing the home improvement projects themselves or using our installation services but many others are to professionals who are in the business of providing construction renovation and property maintenance services spending on home improvement projects increased in 2005 but at a slower rate than in 2004 rising interestrates reduction in the availability of credit increased heating and gas expenses and slowing homeprice appreciation could limit consumer’s discretionary spending and lead to reduced spending on home improvement projects the impact of these economic factors specific to the home improvement industry would be exacerbated by a weak job market 

unseasonable weather and adverse weather conditions can negatively affect our net sales and comparable store sales 

wet and cold weather particularly during the spring and early summer months of the year when many of the products we sell are designed for outdoor use are generally detrimental to our sales and can make it difficult to sell seasonal merchandise inventory although the impact of adverse weather conditions is mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores unseasonable weather is an ongoing significant risk to the performance of our business 

our store expansion and relocation strategy depends upon our ability to successfully open relocate and operate new stores each year 

our growth in net sales depends to a substantial degree on successfully and costeffectively implementing our ongoing aggressive expansion program we must adapt our merchandising marketing and distribution initiatives to new markets both domestically and going forward in canada we must also increase the number of our stores in markets in which we currently operate our ability to open additional stores depends in large measure upon our ability to locate and acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings in the formats with which we operate may affect our ability to open new stores in some markets increased real estate construction and development costs could also limit our growth opportunities our ability to continue to expand our operations depends also on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees if we are unable to open new stores at the rate we currently plan to do so and staff them with qualified employees the growth in our net sales and our competitive position could be adversely affected 

 

if we fail to hire train and retain qualified managers sales associates and other employees in our stores we could lose sales to our competitors 

customers’ perceptions of the quality of service provided by employees can determine any retailer’s success or failure competition for qualified store managers and sales associates among retailers in the home improvement retailing business is intense and if we fail to attract train and retain qualified managers and sales associates in our existing and new stores our financial performance could be adversely impacted consumers shopping for goods and services for home improvement projects expect to have sales associates serving them who are knowledgeable about product categories located throughout our stores 

excessive turnover which has historically been high among employees in entrylevel or parttime positions increases the risk that sales associates will not have the training and experience needed to provide competitive high quality customer service 

our commercial business customers demand a higher level of customer service that is challenging to meet on a consistent basis 

commercial business customers in the home improvement industry expect to have their business handled by commercial sales specialists with an even greater depth of knowledge about the products these customers need if we fail to staff our commercial sales desks in our stores with experienced and knowledgeable employees who can satisfy their demands we run the risk that we will lose commercial business customers to our competitors 

we have many competitors who if we fail to execute our merchandising marketing and distribution strategies effectively could take sales and market share away from us 

we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small direct and indirect competitors the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores price and quality of merchandise instock consistency merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could affect our financial performance moreover unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of our competitors including the effects of competitor liquidation activities may impact our expected results 

an unusual number of product liability or breach of warranty claims for defective products could expose us to expensive claims and damage our standing with our customers 

we are exposed to product liability and product warranty claims relating to the products we sell that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows because we do not have direct control over the quality of products manufactured or supplied to us by our vendors and because we selfinsure for such product liability and warranty claims we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods regardless of the ultimate outcome claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in the products we stock and sell and our reputation 

our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted 

an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies cost reductions and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of improvements to our management information systems to improve operations such as inventory replenishment systems merchandise ordering transportation and receipt processing our financial performance could be adversely affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to improve upgrade maintain and expand our systems 

if the domestic and international supply chain for the products we stock and sell is disrupted our net sales and comparable store sales would be adversely impacted 

we source the approximately 40000 products we stock and sell from approximately 7000 domestic and international vendors we source many of those products directly from foreign manufacturers political or financial instability among suppliers trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain 

our inability to effectively manage and expand our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 

part of our expansion strategy includes continued differentiation from our competitors to better distinguish our product offering we form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected brand names the inability to effectively and efficiently manage the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial results

our stores

investments in existing stores 

in response to customer feedback during fiscal 2004 we continued our long history of investing in our existing stores to create a more inviting shopping experience for our retail and commercial business customers this included brightening our stores making wider aisles adding new displays improving point of sale signage and adding more product selection listed below is how we categorize our investments in our existing stores 

 

minor resets 

minor resets are necessary to drive comparable store sales increases and keep our stores fresh with new and innovative products these resets involve the simple replacement of a particular product or vendor and do not require major changes in the store we conducted hundreds of minor resets in 2004 efficiently and cost effectively 

major resets 

a major reset is designed to make an area of our store more shoppable for our customers or to improve adjacencies within a store in 2004 a major reset was implemented in tool world and is now complete in over 700 stores the new tool world is much more shoppable with wider aisles and our new improved open floor plan both diyers and commercial business customers can find what they need more quickly 

remerchandising 

in 2004 we completed the remerchandising of over 130 of our older stores bringing them up to speed with our most current prototypes this remerchandising focused on moving entire departments improving adjacencies and enhancing the shoppability within the cabinetry appliances flooring and millwork departments we were able to remerchandise these stores with only minimal disruption to our customers investments like these are made to differentiate our stores from the competition and better enable them to deliver the sales performance we expect 

serving our customers 

when customers enter our stores our goal is to make their experience as pleasant and productive as possible through specialty sales initiatives such as installation and purchase advantages like everyday low prices we believe we make home improvement more attainable and affordable 

installed sales 

recognizing that our customers lead busy lives and may not have time to install certain components of their home improvement project we significantly enhanced our installed sales model in 2004 it has proven to be a successful service initiative with an expected growth rate of approximately twice the rate of total company sales growth we now offer installation services in over 40 categories with flooring millwork and kitchen cabinetscountertops generating the highest sales under the new model the separation of selling and administrative tasks allows our sales associates to shift their focus to project selling while project managers ensure that the details related to an installation job are efficiently executed

our market 

w e estimate the size of the us home improvement market to be approximately 500 billion 468 billion of which comprises product demand and 32 billion for the installed labor opportunity data from a variety of primary and secondary sources including trade associations government publications industry participants and other sources was analyzed as the basis for our estimate this estimate includes import and export data and key enduse markets such as residential repair and remodeling and nonresidential construction and maintenance this data also captures a wide range of categories relevant to our business including appliance and garden supplies 

the home improvement industry is a large fragmented and growing market driven in part by significant socioeconomic trends the increase in the median income of the “baby boomer” generation along with their record levels of secondhome ownership and desire for professional installation services are sources of the expected growth along with strong housing turnover and the aging of the housing stock in addition individuals are purchasing their first homes at a younger age and there has been an overall increase in consumer interest in home improvements another source of growth in the home improvement market is the growing immigrant and minority populations minorities are projected to contribute at least twothirds of household growth in coming decades
