customers 

as an industry leader we have established close working relationships with many of our customers these relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions by working with our customers in developing new products and technologies we believe we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about nextgeneration technology across our products

our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support we believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers

we manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries and our relationships with them typically date back many years we believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance additionally we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors

no single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2022 2021 or 2020

sales and distribution 

we maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate our net sales by geographic region 1 as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows

 

 we sell our products into approximately 140 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers in fiscal 2022 our direct sales represented approximately 75 of total net sales we also sell our products indirectly via thirdparty distributors

we maintain distribution centers around the world products are generally delivered to the distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer in some instances however products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer our global coverage positions us near our customers’ locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs we contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products globally via road rail sea and air we believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile

seasonality and backlog 

typically we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business overall the third and fourth fiscal quarters are usually the strongest quarters of our fiscal year whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets

certain of our end markets experience some seasonality our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production and seasonal declines in european production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter also our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases

customer orders and demand may fluctuate as a result of economic and market conditions including the impacts of the covid19 pandemic supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures backlog by reportable segment was as follows

 we expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2022 will be filled during fiscal 2023 backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods

competition 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers competition is generally based on breadth of product offering product innovation price quality delivery and service we have experienced and expect to continue to experience downward pressure on prices however as a result of increased costs certain of our businesses implemented price increases in fiscal 2022 and 2021

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products the principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding precious metals such as gold and silver for plating and other metals such as copper aluminum brass and steel for manufacturing cable contacts and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers the prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand in recent years raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions including the impacts of the covid19 pandemic supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures

intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including patents and patent applications as available in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others

we own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical optical and electronic products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks

while we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents

human capital management 

we have employees located throughout the world as of fiscal year end 2022 we employed approximately 92000 people worldwide including contract employees approximately 27000 were in the asia–pacific region 37000 were in the emea region and 28000 were in the americas region of our total employees approximately 56000 were employed in manufacturing our strong employee base along with their commitment to uncompromising values provides the foundation of our company’s success

during fiscal 2022 we conducted our third annual employee engagement survey which was a fully digital enterprisewide survey available in 17 languages and focused on measuring engagement inclusion and leadership effectiveness we had a participation rate of over 85 in fiscal 2022 and year over year improvement in all three indices of engagement inclusion and leadership effectiveness our engagement and inclusion scores were once again favorable when compared to glint inc’s external global manufacturing benchmark  by fiscal 2025 we aspire to be in the top tier of this benchmark on engagement and inclusion in addition to the overall improvement in our leadership effectiveness index all nine scores within the index also increased from fiscal 2021 levels 

we continue to emphasize employee development and training to support engagement and retention to empower employees to unleash their potential we provide a range of development programs and opportunities skills and resources they need to be successful our learnte platform supplements our talent development strategies it is an online portal that enables employees to access instructorled classroom or virtual courses and selfdirected webbased courses strategy execution and talent “set” leadership expectations which focus on how we drive strategy effectively execute and build talent have been rolled out to all employees and are embedded in all of our leadership programs we integrate these behavioral expectations into the way we assess and select talent manage performance and develop and reward our people 

we are committed to identifying and developing our next generation of leaders we have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established specialized programs to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in general management engineering and operations as well as the diversity of our talent we are focused on both the recruitment of diverse candidates and the development of our diverse employees to provide the opportunity to advance their careers and move into leadership positions within the company on an annual basis we conduct an organization and leadership review process with our chief executive officer and all segment business unit and function leaders focusing on our highperforming and highpotential talent diverse talent and the succession for our most critical 

roles also our board of directors reviews and assesses management development plans for senior executives and the succession plans relating to those positions

we are committed to the safety health human rights and wellbeing of our employees we continuously evaluate opportunities to raise safety and health standards through our environmental health and safety team compliance audits and internal processes are in place to stay ahead of workplace hazards and we aim to reduce our occupational safety and health administration “osha” total recordable incident rate—a rate equivalent to the number of incidents per 100 employees or 200000 work hours—to 012 by fiscal 2025 during the covid19 pandemic we took additional actions to protect the physical and mental health and wellbeing of our global employees we have utilized our workplace flexibility guidelines promoted our wellbeing connection program and health care benefits to support the needs of all employees and instituted additional safety measures at all factories and sites we are striving to implement a global human rights program we have recently instituted a global human rights policy and a human trafficking and modern slavery policy we apply high standards of human rights and require that our suppliers do the same

we believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership our chief executive officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience they are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry for discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees see “part 1 item 1a risk factors”

government regulation and supervision 

the import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events we have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction

see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding trade compliance matters also see “part i item 1a risk factors” for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with trade regulations

environmental 

our operations are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment greenhouse gas emissions hazardous materials in products and chemical usage we are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment we maintain a global environmental health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards staff dedicated to environmental health and safety issues periodic compliance auditing training and other measures we also have a program for compliance with the european union “eu” restriction of hazardous substances “rohs” and waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” directives the china administrative measures for the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic products “china rohs” regulation the eu registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulation and similar laws

compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future for example laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection management and reporting and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products we also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations based upon our experience available information and applicable laws as of fiscal year end 2022 we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of 17 million to 44 million and we accrued 20 million as the probable loss which was the best estimate within this range we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2023 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions

sustainability 

we look to build on our strong foundation of environmental sustainability in our operations our one connected world strategy guides how we balance investor and customer expectations and drive improved environmental sustainability 

our sustainability initiatives in our operations began more than ten years ago from fiscal 2010 to 2022 we achieved more than a 20 reduction in absolute energy usage more than a 25 reduction in absolute water usage and more than a 50 reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions scopes 1 and 2 over the last few years we have recycled approximately 80 of the waste materials from our operations we have challenged ourselves to find new ways to continue to drive sustainability improvements in fiscal 2022 we

 

while sustainability is embedded in our operations we are exploring opportunities with our direct suppliers and logistics service providers to strengthen the environmental sustainability of our supply chain the majority of our greenhouse gas emissions are from the goods and services we use in our operations in addition to improving the sustainability of our operations and working with our suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions we help our customers produce smaller lighter and more energyefficient products reducing the environmental impact of the products our customers make through the life of their products with every product that comes out of our facilities we support a safer sustainable productive and connected future

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our securities these risks are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations financial condition and liquidity  

risks relating to the macroeconomic environment and our global presence 

conditions in global or regional economies capital and money markets and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally including new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade changes to fiscal and monetary policy inflation slower growth or recession higher interest rates the cost and availability of consumer and business credit end demand from consumer and industrial markets and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults any of these economic factors could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow and ability to obtain financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full further our vendors may experience similar problems which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels if regional or global economic conditions deteriorate our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected also deterioration in economic conditions expectations for future revenue projected future cash flows or other factors have triggered and could trigger additional recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other longlived assets impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in united states “us” dollars however a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue approximately 60 of our net sales for fiscal 2022 were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect nonus dollar revenue to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net sales we have elected not to hedge this foreign currency exposure therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro or asian currencies our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease recently the strength of the us dollar has generally increased as compared to other currencies which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our operating results as reported in us dollars

we manage certain cash intercompany and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts in addition to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to these contracts our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful

we have suffered and could continue to suffer significant business interruptions including impacts resulting from the covid19 pandemic and other macroeconomic factors 

our operations and those of our suppliers and customers and the supply chains that support their operations may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis typhoons tornados or floods other disasters such as fires explosions acts of terrorism or war including the continuing military conflict between russia and ukraine resulting from russia’s invasion of ukraine or escalating tensions in surrounding countries disease or other adverse health developments including impacts resulting from the covid19 pandemic or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes in addition such interruptions could result in a widespread crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our end customers’ products if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected the covid19 pandemic impacted and continues to impact countries communities workforces supply chains and markets around the world and as a result we have experienced disruptions and restrictions on our employees’ ability to travel as well as temporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers suppliers and other vendors in our supply chain as a result of the ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic some of our employees are continuing to work from home on a fulltime or parttime basis which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks the covid19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on our sales and operating results during fiscal 2020 and continued to negatively affect certain of our businesses in fiscal 2021 and certain of our operations in china in fiscal 2022 while some of our operations in china were shut down for a period of time in fiscal 2022 the covid19 pandemic did not have a significant impact on our businesses globally in fiscal 2022 however it may 

have a negative impact on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations in future periods the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will further impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted such developments may include the further spread of the virus to additional persons and geographic regions the severity of the virus variant strains of the virus the duration of the pandemic resumption of high levels of infections and hospitalizations the success of public health advancements including vaccine production and distribution the resulting impact on our suppliers’ and customers’ supply chains and financial positions including their ability to pay us the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak in jurisdictions in which we operate and the possible impact on the global economy and local economies in which we operate further to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations or financial condition it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section

we could be adversely affected by a decline in the market value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets 

concerns about deterioration in the global economy together with concerns about credit inflation or deflation have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities including fixed income and equity securities which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios in addition the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved a decrease in the value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding 

the global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital as a result we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures the extent of any impact will depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions

we are subject to global risks of political economic and military instability 

our workforce manufacturing research administrative and sales facilities markets customers and suppliers are located throughout the world as a result we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including



 we have sizeable operations in china including 18 principal manufacturing sites in addition approximately 21 of our net sales in fiscal 2022 were made to customers in china economic conditions in china have been and may continue to be volatile and uncertain in addition the legal and regulatory system in china continues to evolve and is subject to change accordingly our operations and transactions with customers in china could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions changes to the regulatory environment or interpretation of chinese law

in addition any downgrade by rating agencies of longterm us sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions which could negatively affect our business financial condition and liquidity

changes in us federal tax laws could result in adverse consequences to us persons treated as owning 10 or more of our shares 

although we are a swiss corporation application of certain us tax law ownership attribution rules may cause nonus subsidiaries to be treated as controlled foreign corporations “cfcs” for us federal income tax purposes a us person that is treated for us federal income tax purposes as owning directly indirectly or constructively 10 or more of our shares may be required to annually report and include in its us taxable income its pro rata share of certain types of income earned by our subsidiaries that are treated as cfcs whether or not we make any distributions to such us shareholder a us person that owns 10 or more of our shares should consult a tax adviser regarding the potential implications to it of these changes in us federal income tax law the risk of us federal income tax reporting and compliance obligations with respect to our subsidiaries that are treated as cfcs may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us and others from investing in us which could impact the demand for and value of our shares

risks relating to the industry in which we operate 

we are dependent on the automotive and other industries 

we are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products and our operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets periodic downturns in our customers’ industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

approximately 40 of our net sales for fiscal 2022 were to customers in the automotive industry the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers additionally the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions as a supplier of automotive electronics products our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic or credit conditions and changes in the operations products business models partsourcing requirements financial condition and market share of automotive manufacturers as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers

during fiscal 2022 approximately 12 of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market 10 of our net sales were to customers in the commercial transportation market and 10 of our net sales were to customers in the data and devices end market demand in the industrial equipment industry is dependent upon economic conditions including customer investment in factory and warehouse automation process control systems and building automation and smart city infrastructure as well as market conditions in the rail transportation lighting and other major industrial markets we serve the commercial transportation industry is impacted by the economic environment and market conditions in the heavy truck construction agriculture and recreational vehicle markets demand for data and devices can fluctuate significantly depending on the underlying business and consumer demand for data communication computer and consumer electronics products the overall market trends of increased data connectivity and continued movement to highspeed cloud applications have had a favorable impact on demand

we encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry 

we operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on various factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology our ability to participate in emerging markets and customers’ expectations relating to socially responsible operations the competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large diversified manufacturers to small highly specialized manufacturers the electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities a number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may have the benefit of lower production costs for certain products we cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue 

substantially all markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences which are rapid in certain end markets our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design develop introduce and sell new and innovative products to modify existing products and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change there are numerous risks inherent in these processes including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands

like other suppliers to the electronics industry we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices 

we have experienced and we expect to continue to experience continuing pressure to lower our prices although pricing actions positively impacted our net sales in fiscal 2022 we have historically experienced price erosion averaging from 1 to 2 each year to maintain our margins we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts we cannot provide assurance that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows

we may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate 

many of the industries to which we sell our products as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials have become more concentrated in recent years including the automotive data and devices and aerospace and defense industries consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us in addition as our customers buy in larger volumes their volume buying power has increased enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing these trends may adversely affect the margins on our products particularly for commodity components

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short 

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle as a result the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment if we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

risks relating to our operations 

our results are sensitive to raw material availability quality and cost 

we are a large buyer of resins chemicals additives and metals including copper gold silver aluminum brass steel and zinc many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers the prices of many of these raw materials continue to increase and fluctuations 

may persist in the future in addition feedstock for resins and resins themselves as well as certain other commodities are increasingly subject to varied and unrelated force majeure events worldwide further impacting price and availability in recent years raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions including the impacts of the covid19 pandemic supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures if we have difficulty obtaining raw materials the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are significant price increases for these raw materials it could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers our margins may decline materially affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices the success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials we could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate

the sec requires annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies which use tin tantalum tungsten or gold “conflict minerals” or “3tg” mined from the democratic republic of the congo “drc” and adjoining countries together with the drc the “covered countries” in their products these requirements as well as new and additional regulations like the eu’s conflict minerals regulation could affect the sourcing pricing and availability of 3tg used in the manufacture of certain of our products and may result in only a limited pool of suppliers which can demonstrate that they do not source any 3tg from the covered countries accordingly we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain nonconflict 3tg in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to meet customer nonconflict 3tg standards or sufficiently verify the origins and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures

we may use components and products manufactured by third parties 

we may rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we may rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if these third parties fail to deliver quality products parts and components on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged

our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain management and executive management employees 

our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our management and executive management employees and hire new management and executive management employees to replace succeed or add to members of our management team our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for management talent is intense and any difficulties we may have to retain or hire members of management to achieve our objectives may have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or violations of data privacy laws could interfere with our operations compromise confidential information and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise information belonging to us our employees customers and suppliers and expose us to liabilities or penalties which could adversely impact our business and reputation in the normal course of business we rely on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally we collect and store certain data including proprietary business information and customer and employee data and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls specifically we are subject to the laws of various states and countries where we operate or do business related to solicitation collection processing transferring storing or use of consumer customer vendor or employee information or related data including the eu’s general data protection regulation the california consumer privacy act and china’s personal information protection law in addition certain countries in which we operate or do business have enacted or are considering enacting laws that impose additional data transfer restrictions if countries in which 

we operate or do business were to adopt data localization or data residency laws we could be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols build new storage facilities andor devote additional resources to comply with the requirements of such laws any of which could have significant implications to business operations and costs

in addition to our own systems we have outsourced and expect to continue to outsource certain information technology services—including cloud computing services and storage systems system development and information technology support services—which have in the past and in the future may subject our information technology and other sensitive information to additional risk 

our cybersecurity safeguards and measures are reviewed and upgraded to mitigate evolving cybersecurity threats these measures notwithstanding our information technology networks and infrastructure are vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by malicious actors with significant financial and technological resources breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters pandemics or other catastrophic events which may require us to notify regulators customers or employees and enlist identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach we continue to monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our information technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our intellectual property and our employees’ customers’ and suppliers’ data security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or violations of applicable laws could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties disruption in operations and damage to our reputation which could materially adversely affect our business while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure including attempted cyber intrusions to date none of these threats have had a material impact on our business or operations some of our employees continue to work from home on a fulltime or parttime basis which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our fiveyear unsecured senior revolving credit facility “credit facility” contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens our outstanding notes’ indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate merge and sell assets

although none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations our continued ability to meet the credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant a breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our credit facility if the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors including



 risks relating to strategic transactions 

future acquisitions may not be successful 

we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings and we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years we anticipate that we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy we cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future we also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity 

if we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements this acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to complete an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares

divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered

risks relating to intellectual property litigation and regulations 

our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology 

the electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights within this industry companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights depending on the importance of the technology product patent trademark or trade secret in question an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the normal course of business we are from time to time a defendant in litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights anticompetitive behavior product liability breach of contract and employmentrelated claims in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

if any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations our business may suffer 

our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the us and the eu these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we may also be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification to be lawful and enforceable if we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements whether at all or in material part our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also must comply with applicable trade regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses the issuance of which may be influenced by geopolitical and other events any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows in this regard we have been investigating our past compliance with relevant us trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the us department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” and the us state department’s directorate of defense trade controls “ddtc” we are cooperating with the bis and ddtc on these matters and the resulting investigations by the agencies remain ongoing we have also been contacted by the us department of justice concerning aspects of these matters we are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies’ investigations an unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties although we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom’s bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom’s bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance program we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation government enforcement actions and reputational risk 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate and where our products are sold these laws and regulations govern among other things

 we may not have been or we may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators in addition environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance requirements

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation reporting removal and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigation reporting removal and remediation costs under certain regulatory regimes such as us federal and state laws is retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notifications from the us environmental protection agency other environmental agencies and third parties that conditions at a number of currently and formerlyowned or operated sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites we also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation andor remediation is necessary

while we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury property damage andor cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities

our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage hazardous material content recycling and other circular economy initiatives 

the eu china and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal use of hazardous materials in products use of chemicals in manufacturing recycling of products at the end of their useful life circular economy initiatives and other related matters these laws include but are not limited to the eu rohs endoflife vehicle and weee directives the eu reach regulation and the china rohs regulation these laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes registration chemical testing labeling and other matters these laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale these laws could make the manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions and could result in liability for product recalls penalties or other claims

risks relating to our swiss jurisdiction of incorporation 

as a swiss corporation we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares 

as a swiss corporation our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements in addition our articles of association allow us to create conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes 

until recently swiss law provided for the option to create authorized share capital that could be issued by the board of directors but this authorization was limited to authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with the authorization valid for a maximum of two years such authorization period under our articles of association ended on march 11 2022 as part of the swiss corporate law reform effective as of january 1 2023 the concept of authorized share capital will be replaced by a capital band under a capital band the articles of association may authorize the board of directors for a maximum period of five years to increase the ordinary share capital registered in the commercial register to a maximum of 150 andor reduce it to a minimum of 50 of the share capital existing at the time of the introduction of the capital band our articles of association do not currently provide for a capital band

additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation dividends andor voting moreover under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a proxy statement with the sec and convene a meeting of shareholders which would delay the timing to execute such actions such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management while we do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors

we might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

we anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes in order to make the distributions on our shares to shareholders free of swiss withholding tax various tax law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital or that swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices

currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

the registered share capital in our unconsolidated swiss statutory financial statements is denominated in swiss francs although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in us dollars shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital if the us dollar were to increase in value relative to the swiss franc the us dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without swiss withholding tax will decrease

we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares 

the swiss code of obligations regulates a corporation’s ability to hold or repurchase its own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors

registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings 

our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by swiss law for swiss companies like us that issue registered shares as opposed to bearer shares this provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights holders of our shares must be registered in our share register aktienbuch as shareholders with voting rights only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders’ meetings but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends distributions preemptive rights advance subscription rights and liquidation proceeds the board of directors may in its discretion refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements in our articles of association

certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable 

our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered “antitakeover” provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors under these provisions among others

 these provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital in either case representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in case of issuances from authorized capital such authorization period ended on march 11 2022 and was not reapproved by our shareholders at our march 9 2022 annual general meeting of shareholders without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders’ preemptive rights or advance subscription rights for the purpose of the defense of an actual threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid in relation to which the board of directors upon consultation with an independent financial advisor has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders we note that swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital in addition the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which our shares are listed requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power with limited exceptions

global legislative and regulatory actions and proposals could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate and our global cash taxes 

various legislative and regulatory proposals have been directed at multinational companies with operations in lowertax jurisdictions there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives such as

 if these proposals are adopted they may materially increase cash taxes increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate cause double taxation and increase audit risk we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us

legislation in the us could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to us companies that have moved to lowertax jurisdictions

we expect the us congress to continue to consider implementation andor expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad we cannot predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals therefore we cannot provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us in addition we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to us federal or state governments or the willingness of our nongovernmental customers to do business with us as a result of these uncertainties we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us

swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

as we are organized under the laws of switzerland it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us and switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws would not be allowed in swiss courts as they are contrary to switzerland’s public policy

swiss law differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers thus holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax in addition we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims at any given time in the normal course of business we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions if infringement of a third party’s patent were to be determined against us we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products if a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our consolidated balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge which could be significant in amount

management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

summary of fiscal 2022 performance 

 

economic conditions 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions the global economy has been impacted by the covid19 pandemic and the military conflict between russia and ukraine as well as supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures see “russiaukraine military conflict” and “covid19 pandemic” for additional information 

​ 

our business operates globally and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on our results foreign currency translation negatively impacted our net sales by 723 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 we expect translation to continue to have a negative impact on our operating results in fiscal 2023 we expect translation to negatively impact our net sales by approximately 1 billion in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 as a result of continued strength of the us dollar against other currencies

we are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve as a result of inflationary pressure we have implemented price increases for a number of our products also we have taken and continue to focus on actions to manage costs including restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives such as reducing discretionary spending and travel additionally we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs see further discussion in “liquidity and capital resources”

russiaukraine military conflict 

we are monitoring the military conflict between russia and ukraine escalating tensions in surrounding countries and associated sanctions we suspended our business operations in russia and our operations in ukraine have been reduced to focus on the safety of our employees we have experienced increased costs for transportation energy and raw materials due in part to the negative impact of the russiaukraine military conflict on the global economy the increased costs and 

supply chain disruptions resulting from the conflict have not been material to our business and we have been able to partially mitigate them through price increases or productivity neither russia nor ukraine represents a material portion of our business and the military conflict has not had a significant impact on our business financial condition or result of operations during fiscal 2022

the full impact of the military conflict on our business operations and financial performance remains uncertain the extent to which the conflict may impact our business in future periods will depend on future developments including the severity and duration of the conflict its impact on regional and global economic conditions and supply chain disruptions we will continue to actively monitor the conflict and assess the related sanctions and other effects and may take further actions if necessary

covid19 pandemic 

a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” was first identified in china in december 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health organization covid19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in business slowdowns or shutdowns and travel restrictions in affected areas the pandemic had a negative impact on certain of our businesses in fiscal 2021 and continued to impact certain of our operations in china for a period of time in fiscal 2022 the pandemic has not had a significant impact on our ability to staff our operations and we do not expect that it will continue to have a significant impact on our businesses globally in the near term throughout our operations we implemented additional health and safety measures for the protection of our employees including providing personal protective equipment enhanced cleaning and sanitizing of our facilities and remote working arrangements

the covid19 pandemic has impacted and continues to impact our business operations globally causing disruption in our suppliers’ and customers’ supply chains some of our business locations to reduce or suspend operations and a reduction in demand for certain products from direct customers or end markets in addition the pandemic had farreaching impacts on many additional aspects of our operations both directly and indirectly including with respect to its impacts on customer behaviors business and manufacturing operations inventory our employees and the market generally 

the extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our business and the markets we serve will depend on future developments which may include the further spread of the virus variant strains of the virus and the resumption of high levels of infections and hospitalizations as well as the success of public health advancements including vaccine production and distribution while certain of our operations were shut down in china for a period of time in fiscal 2022 we do not expect the covid19 pandemic to have a significant impact on our businesses globally in the near term however it may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 

we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers suppliers shareholders and the communities in which we operate

for further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the covid19 pandemic see “part i item 1a risk factors”

outlook 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 we expect our net sales to be approximately 375 billion as compared to 38 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately 131 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 this outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately 400 million and 019 per share respectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2022 also this outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels

acquisitions 

during fiscal 2022 we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of 245 million net of cash acquired the acquisitions were reported as part of our communications solutions segment from the date of acquisition

we acquired four businesses for a combined cash purchase price of 422 million net of cash acquired during fiscal 2021 the acquisitions were reported as part of our industrial solutions segment from the date of acquisition

see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding acquisitions

results of operations 

net sales 

the following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by segment

 the following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by segment

 net sales increased 1358 million or 91 in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 the increase in net sales resulted from organic net sales growth of 121 and net sales contributions of 19 from acquisitions and divestitures partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 49 due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies in fiscal 2022 pricing actions positively affected organic net sales by 509 million fiscal 2022 included an additional week which contributed 306 million in net sales the impact of the additional week was estimated using an average sales figure for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year see further discussion of net sales below under “segment results”

net sales by geographic region our business operates in three geographic regions—asia–pacific emea and the americas—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into us dollars at the end of each fiscal period we sell our products into approximately 140 countries and approximately 60 of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar in fiscal 2022 the percentage of net sales in fiscal 2022 by major currencies invoiced was as follows

 the following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by geographic region



the following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by geographic region

 cost of sales and gross margin 

the following table presents cost of sales and gross margin information

 

 

in fiscal 2022 gross margin increased 357 million as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of higher volume and the positive impact of pricing actions partially offset by inflationary pressure on material and operating costs and the negative impact of foreign currency translation

we use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products and cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices in recent years raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions including the impacts of the covid19 pandemic supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures as a result we have experienced shortages and price increases in some of our input materials—including copper gold silver and palladium—however we have been able to initiate pricing actions which have partially offset these impacts the following table presents the average prices incurred related to copper gold silver and palladium

 ​ 

in fiscal 2022 we purchased approximately 215 million pounds of copper 129000 troy ounces of gold 27 million troy ounces of silver and 13000 troy ounces of palladium we expect to purchase approximately 215 million pounds of copper 125000 troy ounces of gold 27 million troy ounces of silver and 10000 troy ounces of palladium in fiscal 2023

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expense information

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2022 selling general and administrative expenses increased 72 million as compared to fiscal 2021 due primarily to increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels the impact of inflation and incremental expenses attributable to recent acquisitions partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency translation

restructuring and other charges net we are committed to continuous productivity improvements and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint migrate facilities to lowercost regions reduce fixed costs and eliminate excess capacity these initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry improve our operating leverage and position us for future growth 

during fiscal 2022 and 2021 we initiated restructuring programs associated with footprint consolidation and cost structure improvements across all segments we incurred net restructuring and related charges of 153 million of which 16 million was recorded in cost of sales in fiscal 2022 and 208 million in fiscal 2021 annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2022 are expected to be approximately 120 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2025 cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2023 we expect total restructuring charges to be approximately 150 million and total spending which will be funded with cash from operations to be approximately 165 million

liquidity and capital resources 

our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our access to capital markets money markets or other sources of funding as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements we believe that cash generated from operations and to the extent necessary these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future including the payment of €550 million of 110 senior notes due in march 2023 we may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program to acquire strategic businesses or product lines to pay dividends on our common shares or to reduce our outstanding debt the cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions we will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions we believe that we have sufficient financial resources and liquidity which will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital and other cash flow needs 

as of fiscal year end 2022 our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world under current applicable laws substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to tyco electronics group sa “tegsa” our luxembourg subsidiary which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt and to te connectivity ltd our swiss parent company however the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense we provide for tax liabilities on the consolidated financial statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations as of fiscal year end 2022 we had approximately 70 billion of cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits principally in our subsidiaries that we have the ability to distribute to tegsa and te connectivity ltd but we consider to be permanently reinvested we estimate that an immaterial amount of tax expense would be recognized on the consolidated financial statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations including investing and financing activities

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities decreased 208 million to 2468 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to 2676 million in fiscal 2021 the decrease resulted primarily from the impact of increased working capital 

levels partially offset by higher pretax income the amount of income taxes paid net of refunds during fiscal 2022 and 2021 was 421 million and 371 million respectively

pension contributions were 42 million and 61 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively we expect pension contributions to be 43 million in fiscal 2023 before consideration of any voluntary contributions for additional information regarding pensions see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures were 768 million and 690 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively we expect fiscal 2023 capital spending levels to be approximately 5 of net sales we believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities

during fiscal 2022 we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of 245 million net of cash acquired we acquired four businesses for a combined cash purchase price of 422 million net of cash acquired during fiscal 2021 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding acquisitions

​ 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in certain instances we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2023 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability for 

investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

at fiscal year end 2022 we had outstanding letters of credit letters of guarantee and surety bonds of 127 million excluding those related to our former subsea communications “subcom” business which are discussed below

during fiscal 2019 we sold our subcom business in connection with the sale we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the subcom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale these performance guarantees and letters of credit had a combined value of approximately 115 million as of fiscal year end 2022 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2027 we have contractual recourse against the subcom business if we are required to perform on any subcom guarantees however based on historical experience we do not anticipate having to perform

commitments and contingencies 

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable leases and other material obligations at fiscal year end 2022

 

  

legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including patent infringement claims product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

trade compliance matters 

we have been investigating our past compliance with relevant us trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the us department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” and the us state department’s directorate of defense trade controls “ddtc” we are cooperating with the bis and ddtc on these matters and the resulting investigations by the agencies remain ongoing we have also been contacted by the us department of justice concerning aspects of these matters we are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies’ investigations an unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties although we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties management’s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period

revenue recognition 

we account for revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 606 revenue from contracts with customers  our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract such as a purchase order with a customer are satisfied generally this occurs with the transfer of control we transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers the customers accept and have legal title for the product and we have a right to payment for such product revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations we apply the practical expedient of asc 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations

we generally warrant that our products will conform to our or mutually agreed to specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time we limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product we do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations

although products are generally sold at fixed prices certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards such as sales rebates return allowances scrap allowances and other rights which are accounted for as variable consideration we estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other 

intangible assets include both indeterminablelived residual goodwill and determinablelived identifiable intangible assets intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property consisting of patents trademarks and 

unpatented technology and customer relationships recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straightline basis evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinablelived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant

we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment a “component” if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management at fiscal year end 2022 we had five reporting units all of which contained goodwill there were two reporting units in both the transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments and one reporting unit in the communications solutions segment when changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values we review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test or more frequently based on changes in our structure

goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired in assessing a potential impairment management relies on several reporting unitspecific factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows transactions and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis

when testing for goodwill impairment we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the amount of the excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit

fair value estimates used in the goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit the income approach is supported by a guideline analysis a market approach these approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates discount rates income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and determined that no impairment existed

income taxes 

in determining pretax income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of pretax operating income in various tax jurisdictions the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings

changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any enacted changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 income taxes  we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets

pension plans 

our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions the funded status of our plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date the projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels the fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds held for the sole benefit of participants which are invested by the trustees of the funds the benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors such as years of service and compensation

net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants or for inactive plans over the remaining life expectancy of participants

two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are discount rates and expected longterm returns on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and employee turnover these assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions discount rates represent the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and are used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans a decrease in discount rates increases the present value of pension benefit obligations at fiscal year end 2022 a 25basispoint decrease in discount rates would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by 64 million a 25basispoint increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by 61 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets a 50basispoint decrease or increase in the expected longterm returns on plan assets would have increased or decreased respectively our fiscal 2022 pension expense by 11 million

at fiscal year end 2022 the longterm target asset allocation in our us plans’ master trust is 25 returnseeking assets and 75 liabilityhedging assets asset reallocation to meet that target is occurring over a multiyear period based on the funded status we expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 110 based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2022 our target asset allocation is 67 returnseeking and 33 liabilityhedging

accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements

nongaap financial measure 

organic net sales growth 

we present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with gaap organic net sales growth represents net sales growth the most comparable gaap financial measure excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months if any organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management’s control such as the impact of changes in 

foreign currency exchange rates and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company such as acquisition and divestiture activity

organic net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate performance also management uses this measure together with gaap financial measures in its decisionmaking processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company it is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations the tables presented in “results of operations” and “segment results” provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with gaap

organic net sales growth is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with gaap this nongaap financial measure may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures reported by other companies the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results this limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth to better understand the amounts character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts

forwardlooking information 

certain statements in this annual report are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the us private securities litigation reform act of 1995 section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the exchange act these statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management forwardlooking statements include among others the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations business strategies financing plans competitive position potential growth opportunities potential operating performance improvements acquisitions divestitures the effects of competition and the effects of future legislation or regulations forwardlooking statements also include statements addressing our environmental social governance and sustainability plans and goals forwardlooking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as the words “believe” “expect” “plan” “intend” “anticipate” “aspire” “estimate” “predict” “potential” “goal” “target” “continue” “may” and “should” or the negative of these terms or similar expressions

forwardlooking statements involve risks uncertainties and assumptions actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements investors should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements we do not have any intention or obligation to update forwardlooking statements after we file this report except as required by law

the following and other risks which are described in greater detail in “part i item 1a risk factors” as well as other risks described in this annual report could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward   looking statements 



 

there may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency movements on outstanding debt and nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks

we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an aa2 credit rating there is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty

foreign currency exposures 

as part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we utilize crosscurrency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions in addition we utilize crosscurrency swap contracts to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2022 market rates would have changed the unrealized 

value of our contracts by 151 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2021 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 240 million such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the losses or gains on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions

interest rate and investment exposures 

we issue debt as needed to fund our operations and capital requirements such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure to manage the interest rate exposure we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt there were no such contracts and no floating rate debt outstanding at fiscal year end 2022 or 2021

we may use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt at fiscal year end 2021 we had forward starting interest rate swap contracts which had an aggregate notional value of 450 million and were designated as cash flow hedges there were no forward starting interest rate swap contracts at fiscal year end 2022

we utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities

commodity exposures 

our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges we continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period at fiscal year end 2022 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver copper and palladium were in a net loss position of 82 million and had a notional value of 566 million at fiscal year end 2021 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver copper and palladium were in a net gain position of 1 million and had a notional value of 512 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of commodity prices from the fiscal year end 2022 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 48 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of commodity prices from the fiscal year end 2021 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 51 million

covid19 pandemic 

a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” was first identified in china in december 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health organization covid19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in business slowdowns or shutdowns and travel restrictions in affected areas the pandemic had a significant negative impact on our sales and operating results during fiscal 2020 and continued to negatively affect certain of our businesses in fiscal 2021 see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for discussion regarding the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our financial results also see “part i item 1a risk factors” for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the covid19 pandemic

segments 

we operate through three reportable segments transportation solutions industrial solutions and communications solutions prior to the covid19 pandemic our three segments served a combined market of approximately 190 billion although covid19 negatively affected our markets in fiscal 2020 certain of our markets experienced recovery in fiscal 2021 we expect this recovery will continue and our three segments will once again serve a combined market of approximately 190 billion in future periods

our net sales by segment as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows

 below is a description of our reportable segments and the primary products markets and competitors of each segment

transportation solutions 

the transportation solutions segment is a leader in connectivity and sensor technologies the primary products sold by the transportation solutions segment include terminals and connector systems and components sensors relays antennas heat shrink tubing and application tooling the transportation solutions segment’s products which must withstand harsh conditions are used in the following end markets

  

the transportation solutions segment’s major competitors include yazaki aptiv sumitomo sensata honeywell molex and amphenol

 the communications solutions segment’s major competitors include amphenol molex jst and korea electric terminal ket

customers 

as an industry leader we have established close working relationships with many of our customers these relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions by working with our customers in developing new products and technologies we believe we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about nextgeneration technology across our products

our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support we believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers

we manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries and our relationships with them typically date back many years we believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance additionally we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors

no single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2021 2020 or 2019

sales and distribution 

we maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate our net sales by geographic region 1 as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows

 



we sell our products into approximately 140 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers in fiscal 2021 our direct sales represented approximately 80 of total net sales we also sell our products indirectly via thirdparty distributors

we maintain distribution centers around the world products are generally delivered to the distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer in some instances however products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer our global coverage positions us near our customers’ locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs we contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products globally via road rail sea and air we believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile

seasonality and backlog 

typically we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business overall the third and fourth fiscal quarters are usually the strongest quarters of our fiscal year whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets

certain of our end markets experience some seasonality our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production and seasonal declines in european production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter also our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases

customer orders and demand may fluctuate as a result of economic and market conditions including the impacts of the covid19 pandemic backlog by reportable segment was as follows

 we expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2021 will be filled during fiscal 2022 backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods

competition 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers competition is generally based on breadth of product offering product innovation price quality delivery and service we have experienced and expect to continue to experience downward pressure on prices however as a result of increased costs certain of our businesses implemented price increases in fiscal 2021

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products the principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding precious metals such as gold and silver for plating and other metals such as copper aluminum brass and steel for manufacturing cable contacts and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers the prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand as markets recover from the covid19 pandemic increases in consumer demand have led to shortages and price increases in some of our input materials

intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including patents and patent applications as available in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others

we own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical optical and electronic products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks

while we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents

human capital management 

we have employees located throughout the world as of fiscal year end 2021 we employed approximately 89000 people worldwide including contract employees approximately 37000 were in the emea region 24000 were in the asia–pacific region and 28000 were in the americas region of our total employees approximately 56000 were employed in manufacturing our strong employee base along with their commitment to uncompromising values provides the foundation of our company’s success

we embrace diversity and inclusion a truly innovative workforce needs to be diverse and leverage the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds and experiences to drive our business outcomes globally we believe we must build a workforce and supplier network that represents our global markets and the customers we serve we are also committed to a work environment where all employees are engaged feel differences are valued and mutuallyrespected and believe that all opinions count our people reflect our customers and markets our employees are in over 50 countries representing approximately 120 nationalities and our total employee population is over 40 women our employee resource groups “ergs” are companysponsored voluntary employeeled groups that focus on diverse talent segments or shared experiences of employees these groups apply those perspectives to create value for our company as a whole the ergs provide a space where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment as of fiscal year end 2021 we had eight ergs—align lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queerquestioning employees and their allies women in networking te young professionals african heritage asian heritage latin heritage thrive employees and their allies with mixed mental emotional and physical abilities and te veterans our ergs have a total of over 6000 members 

during fiscal 2021 we conducted our second consecutive employee engagement survey which was a fully digital enterprisewide survey available in 15 languages and focused on measuring engagement inclusion and leadership effectiveness we had a participation rate of over 80 in fiscal 2021 both our participation rate and engagement score improved in fiscal 2021 while our inclusion score remained consistent with fiscal 2020 fiscal 2021 was the first year leadership effectiveness was measured as part of this survey additionally our survey results for fiscal 2021 were favorable when compared to glint inc’s external global manufacturing benchmark  by fiscal 2025 we aspire to be in the top tier of this benchmark on engagement and inclusion 

we continue to emphasize employee development and training to support engagement and retention to empower employees to unleash their potential we provide a range of development programs and opportunities skills and resources 

they need to be successful our learnte platform supplements our talent development strategies it is an online portal that enables employees to access instructorled classroom or virtual courses and selfdirected webbased courses strategy execution and talent “set” leadership expectations which focus on how we drive strategy effectively execute and build talent have been rolled out to all employees and are embedded in all of our leadership programs we integrate these behavioral expectations into the way we assess and select talent manage performance and develop and reward our people 

we are committed to identifying and developing our next generation of leaders we have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established specialized programs to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in general management engineering and operations as well as the diversity of our talent we are focused on both the recruitment of diverse candidates and the development of our diverse employees to provide the opportunity to advance their careers and move into leadership positions within the company on an annual basis we conduct an organization and leadership review process with our chief executive officer and all segment business unit and function leaders focusing on our highperforming and highpotential talent diverse talent and the succession for our most critical roles also our board of directors reviews and assesses management development plans for senior executives and the succession plans relating to those positions

we are committed to the safety health human rights and wellbeing of our employees we continuously evaluate opportunities to raise safety and health standards through our environmental health and safety team compliance audits and internal processes are in place to stay ahead of workplace hazards and we aim to reduce our occupational safety and health administration “osha” total recordable incident rate—a rate equivalent to the number of incidents per 100 employees or 200000 work hours—to 012 by fiscal 2025 during the covid19 pandemic we have taken additional actions to protect the physical and mental health and wellbeing of our global employees we have utilized our workplace flexibility guidelines promoted our wellbeing connection program and health care benefits to support the needs of all employees and instituted additional safety measures at all factories and sites in fiscal 2021 we implemented a human rights policy for the organization outlining our commitment to operating with respect for human rights

we believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership our chief executive officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience they are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry for discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees see “part 1 item 1a risk factors”

government regulation and supervision 

the import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events we have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction

see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding trade compliance matters also see “part i item 1a risk factors” for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with trade regulations

environmental 

our operations are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment greenhouse gas emissions hazardous materials in products and chemical usage we are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment we maintain a global environmental health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards staff dedicated to environmental health and safety issues periodic compliance auditing training and other measures we also have a program for compliance with the european union “eu” restriction of hazardous substances and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the china administrative measures for the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic products the eu registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulation and similar laws

compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future for example laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data 

collection management and reporting and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products we also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations based upon our experience available information and applicable laws as of fiscal year end 2021 we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of 18 million to 47 million and we accrued 21 million as the probable loss which was the best estimate within this range we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2022 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions

sustainability 

we look to build on our strong foundation of environmental sustainability in our operations our environmental sustainability strategy guides how we balance investor and customer expectations and drive improved environmental sustainability

our sustainability initiatives in our operations began more than 10 years ago from fiscal 2010 to 2020 we achieved more than a 25 reduction in absolute energy usage absolute greenhouse gas emissions scopes 1 and 2 and absolute water usage over the last few years we have recycled approximately 80 of the waste materials from our operations we have challenged ourselves to find new ways to continue to drive sustainability improvements in fiscal 2021 we

 

while sustainability is embedded in our operations we are exploring opportunities with our direct suppliers and logistics service providers to strengthen the environmental sustainability of our supply chain the majority of our greenhouse gas emissions are from the goods and services we use in our operations in addition to improving the sustainability of our operations and working with our suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions we help our customers produce smaller lighter and more energyefficient products reducing the environmental impact of the products our customers make through the life of their products with every product that comes out of our facilities we support a safer sustainable productive and connected future

 item 1a risk factors 

investors should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities these risks are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations financial condition and liquidity  

risks relating to the macroeconomic environment and our global presence 

conditions in global or regional economies capital and money markets and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit end demand from consumer and industrial markets and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults any of these economic factors could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow and ability to obtain financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full further our vendors may experience similar problems which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels if regional or global economic conditions deteriorate our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected also deterioration in economic conditions expectations for future revenue projected future cash flows or other factors have triggered and could trigger additional recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other longlived assets impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in united states “us” dollars however a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue approximately 60 of our net sales for fiscal 2021 were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect nonus dollar revenue to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net sales we have elected not to hedge this foreign currency exposure therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro or asian currencies our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease

we manage certain cash intercompany and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts in addition to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to these contracts our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful

we have suffered and could continue to suffer significant business interruptions including impacts resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

our operations and those of our suppliers and customers and the supply chains that support their operations may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis typhoons tornados or floods other disasters such as fires explosions acts of terrorism or war or disease or other adverse health developments including impacts resulting from the covid19 pandemic or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes in addition such interruptions could result in a widespread crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our end customers’ products if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected the covid19 pandemic impacted and continues to impact countries communities workforces supply chains and markets around the world and as a result we have experienced disruptions and restrictions on our employees’ ability to travel as well as temporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers suppliers and other vendors in our supply chain as a result of the ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic some of our employees are continuing to work from home on a fulltime or parttime basis which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks the covid19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on our sales and operating results during fiscal 2020 and continued 

to negatively affect certain of our businesses in fiscal 2021 the covid19 pandemic may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will further impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted such developments may include the further spread of the virus to additional persons and geographic regions the severity of the virus variant strains of the virus the duration of the pandemic resumption of high levels of infections and hospitalizations the success of public health advancements including vaccine production and distribution the resulting impact on our suppliers’ and customers’ supply chains and financial positions including their ability to pay us the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak in jurisdictions in which we operate and the possible impact on the global economy and local economies in which we operate further to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations or financial condition it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section

we could be adversely affected by a decline in the market value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets 

concerns about deterioration in the global economy together with concerns about credit inflation or deflation have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities including fixed income and equity securities which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios in addition the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved a decrease in the value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding 

the global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital as a result we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures the extent of any impact will depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions

we are subject to global risks of political economic and military instability 

our workforce manufacturing research administrative and sales facilities markets customers and suppliers are located throughout the world as a result we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including



 we have sizeable operations in china including 16 principal manufacturing sites in addition approximately 22 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 were made to customers in china economic conditions in china have been and may continue to be volatile and uncertain in addition the legal and regulatory system in china continues to evolve and is subject to change accordingly our operations and transactions with customers in china could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions changes to the regulatory environment or interpretation of chinese law

in addition any downgrade by rating agencies of longterm us sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions which could negatively affect our business financial condition and liquidity

changes in us federal tax laws could result in adverse consequences to us persons treated as owning 10 or more of our shares 

although we are a swiss corporation recent us tax law changes have expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules and cause certain of our nonus subsidiaries to be treated as controlled foreign corporations “cfcs” for us federal income tax purposes a us person that is treated for us federal income tax purposes as owning directly indirectly or constructively 10 or more of our shares may be required to annually report and include in its us taxable income its pro rata share of certain types of income earned by our subsidiaries that are treated as cfcs whether or not we make any distributions to such us shareholder a us person that owns 10 or more of our shares should consult a tax adviser regarding the potential implications to it of these changes in us federal income tax law the risk of us federal income tax reporting and compliance obligations with respect to our subsidiaries that are treated as cfcs may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us and others from investing in us which could impact the demand for and value of our shares

risks relating to the industry in which we operate 

we are dependent on the automotive and other industries 

we are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products and our operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets periodic downturns in our customers’ industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

approximately 43 of our net sales for fiscal 2021 were to customers in the automotive industry the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers additionally the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions as a supplier of automotive electronics products our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic or credit conditions and changes in the operations products business models partsourcing requirements financial condition and market share of automotive manufacturers as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers

during fiscal 2021 approximately 10 of our net sales were to customers in the commercial transportation market 9 of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market and 8 of our net sales were to customers in the data and devices end market demand in the commercial transportation industry is impacted by the economic environment and market conditions in the heavy truck construction agriculture and recreational vehicle markets the industrial equipment industry is dependent upon economic conditions including customer investment in factory and warehouse automation process control systems and building automation and smart city infrastructure as well as market conditions in the rail transportation lighting and other major industrial markets we serve demand for data and devices can fluctuate significantly depending on the underlying business and consumer demand for data communication computer and 

consumer electronics products the overall market trends of increased data connectivity and continued movement to highspeed cloud applications have had a favorable impact on demand

we encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry 

we operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on various factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology our ability to participate in emerging markets and customers’ expectations relating to socially responsible operations the competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large diversified manufacturers to small highly specialized manufacturers the electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities a number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may have the benefit of lower production costs for certain products we cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue 

substantially all markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences which are rapid in certain end markets our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design develop introduce and sell new and innovative products to modify existing products and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change there are numerous risks inherent in these processes including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands

like other suppliers to the electronics industry we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices 

we have experienced and we expect to continue to experience continuing pressure to lower our prices although price erosion was not significant in fiscal 2021 we have historically experienced price erosion averaging from 1 to 2 each year to maintain our margins we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts we cannot provide assurance that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows

we may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate 

many of the industries to which we sell our products as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials have become more concentrated in recent years including the automotive data and devices and aerospace and defense industries consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us in addition as our customers buy in larger volumes their volume buying power has increased enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing these trends may adversely affect the margins on our products particularly for commodity components

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short 

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle as a result the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment if we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

risks relating to our operations 

our results are sensitive to raw material availability quality and cost 

we are a large buyer of resins chemicals additives and metals including copper gold silver aluminum brass steel and zinc many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers the prices of many of these raw materials continue to increase and fluctuations may persist in the future in addition feedstock for resins and resins themselves as well as certain other commodities are increasingly subject to varied and unrelated force majeure events worldwide further impacting price and availability if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are significant price increases for these raw materials it could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers our margins may decline materially affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices the success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials we could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate

in accordance with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use tin tantalum tungsten or gold “conflict minerals” or “3tg” mined from the democratic republic of the congo “drc” and adjoining countries together with the drc the “covered countries” in their products these requirements as well as new and additional regulations like the eu’s conflict minerals regulation could affect the sourcing pricing and availability of 3tg used in the manufacture of certain of our products and may result in only a limited pool of suppliers who can demonstrate that they do not source any 3tg from the covered countries accordingly we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain nonconflict 3tg in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to meet customer nonconflict 3tg standards or sufficiently verify the origins and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures

we may use components and products manufactured by third parties 

we may rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we may rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if these third parties fail to deliver quality products parts and components on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged

our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain management and executive management employees 

our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our management and executive management employees and hire new management and executive management employees to replace succeed or add to members of our management team our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for management talent is intense and any difficulties we may have to retain or hire members of management to achieve our objectives may have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or violations of data privacy laws could interfere with our operations compromise confidential information and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise information belonging to us our employees customers and suppliers and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation in the normal course of business we rely on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally we collect and store certain data including proprietary business information and customer and employee data and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and 

customerimposed controls specifically we are subject to the laws of various states and countries where we operate or do business related to solicitation collection processing transferring storing or use of consumer customer vendor or employee information or related data including the eu’s general data protection regulation which went into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 which went into effect in january 2020 in addition several other countries in which we operate or do business such as china have enacted or are considering enacting laws that impose additional data transfer restrictions if countries in which we operate or do business were to adopt data localization or data residency laws we could be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols build new storage facilities andor devote additional resources to comply with the requirements of such laws any of which could have significant implications to business operations and costs

in addition to our own systems we have outsourced and expect to continue to outsource certain support services including cloud storage systems cloud computing services and system development and support services to third parties which has in the past and in the future may subject our information technology and other sensitive information to additional risk despite our cybersecurity measures including employee training monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems which are reviewed and upgraded to mitigate evolving cybersecurity threats our information technology networks and infrastructure has been and may still be vulnerable to damage disruptions including but not limited to computer viruses and other malware denial of service and ransomware or shutdowns due to attack by hackers statesponsored organizations with significant financial and technological resources breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters pandemics including covid19 or other catastrophic events which may require us to notify regulators customers or employees and enlist identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach we have been the target of attempted cyber intrusions we continue to monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our information technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our intellectual property and our employees’ customers’ and suppliers’ data security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or violations of applicable laws could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties disruption in operations and damage to our reputation which could materially adversely affect our business while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure to date none of these threats have had a material impact on our business or operations in addition as a result of the ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic some of our employees are continuing to work from home on a fulltime or parttime basis which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our fiveyear unsecured senior revolving credit facility “credit facility” contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens our outstanding notes’ indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate merge and sell assets

although none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations our continued ability to meet the credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant a breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our credit facility if the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors including

 risks relating to strategic transactions 

future acquisitions may not be successful 

we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings and we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years we anticipate that we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy we cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future we also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity 

if we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements this acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to complete an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares

divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered

risks relating to intellectual property litigation and regulations 

our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology 

the electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights within this industry companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights depending on the importance of the technology product patent trademark or trade secret in question an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the normal course of business we are from time to time a defendant in litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights anticompetitive behavior product liability breach of contract and employmentrelated claims in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

if any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations our business may suffer 

our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the us and the eu these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we may also be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification to be lawful and enforceable if we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements whether at all or in material part our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also must comply with applicable trade regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows in this regard we are investigating our past compliance with relevant us trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the us department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” and the us state department’s directorate of defense trade controls “ddtc” we are cooperating with the bis and ddtc on these matters and both our internal assessment and the resulting investigations by the agencies remain ongoing we are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies’ investigations an unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties while we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom’s bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom’s bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance 

program we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation government enforcement actions and reputational risk 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate and where our products are sold these laws and regulations govern among other things

 we may not have been or we may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators in addition environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance requirements

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigation removal and remediation costs under certain regulatory regimes such as us federal and state laws is retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notifications from the us environmental protection agency other environmental agencies and third parties that conditions at a number of currently and formerlyowned or operated sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites we also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation andor remediation is necessary

while we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury property damage andor cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities

our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage hazardous material content recycling and other circular economy initiatives 

the eu china and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal use of hazardous materials in products use of chemicals in manufacturing recycling of products at the end of their useful life circular economy initiatives and other related matters these laws include but are not limited to the eu restriction of hazardous substances end of life vehicle and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the eu reach regulation and the china administrative measures for the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic products these laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes registration chemical testing labeling and other matters these laws continue to proliferate and 

expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale these laws could make the manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions and could result in liability for product recalls penalties or other claims

risks relating to our swiss jurisdiction of incorporation 

as a swiss corporation we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares 

as a swiss corporation our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements in addition our articles of association allow us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors but this authorization is limited to i authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years which authorization period ends on march 11 2022 approved by our shareholders at our march 11 2020 annual general meeting of shareholders and ii conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation dividends andor voting moreover under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a proxy statement with the sec and convene a meeting of shareholders which would delay the timing to execute such actions such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management while we do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors

we might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

we anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes in order to make the distributions on our shares to shareholders free of swiss withholding tax various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital or that swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors

currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

the registered share capital in our unconsolidated swiss statutory financial statements is denominated in swiss francs although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in us dollars shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital if the us dollar were to increase in value relative to the swiss franc the us dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without swiss withholding tax will decrease

we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares 

the swiss code of obligations regulates a corporation’s ability to hold or repurchase its own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares 

beyond the statutory limit of 10 however only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation additionally various corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to repurchase our shares our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors

registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings 

our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by swiss law for swiss companies like us that issue registered shares as opposed to bearer shares this provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights holders of our shares must be registered in our share register aktienbuch as shareholders with voting rights only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders’ meetings but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends distributions preemptive rights advance subscription rights and liquidation proceeds the board of directors may in its discretion refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements in our articles of association

certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable 

our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered “antitakeover” provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors under these provisions among others

 these provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital in either case representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in case of issuances from authorized capital until march 11 2022 unless reauthorized by shareholders for a subsequent twoyear period without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders’ preemptive rights or advance subscription rights for the purpose of the defense of an actual threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid in relation to which the board of directors upon consultation with an independent financial advisor has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders we note that swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital in addition the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which our shares are listed requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power with limited exceptions

global legislative and regulatory actions and proposals could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate and our global cash taxes 

various legislative and regulatory proposals have been directed at multinational companies with operations in lowertax jurisdictions there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives such as



 if these proposals are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business they could among other things increase cash taxes cause double taxation increase audit risk and materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us in october 2021 the oecd made progress in its efforts to reform the international tax system with 136 of the 140 participating countries and jurisdictions joining a global minimum tax agreement this agreement introduces a 15 global minimum corporate tax rate which will apply to companies with revenue over a set threshold this tax will be assessed on a countrybycountry basis potentially starting as early as 2023

legislation in the us could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to us companies that have moved to lowertax jurisdictions

we expect the us congress to continue to consider implementation andor expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad we cannot predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals therefore we cannot provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us in addition we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to us federal or state governments or the willingness of our nongovernmental customers to do business with us as a result of these uncertainties we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us

swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

as we are organized under the laws of switzerland it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us and switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws would not be allowed in swiss courts as they are contrary to switzerland’s public policy

swiss law differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers thus holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax in addition we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims at any given time in the normal course of business we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions if infringement of a third party’s patent were to be determined against us we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products if a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our consolidated balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge which could be significant in amount

management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

summary of fiscal 2021 performance 

 

covid19 pandemic 

a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” was first identified in china in december 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health organization covid19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in business slowdowns or shutdowns and travel restrictions in affected areas the pandemic had a significant negative impact on our sales and operating results during fiscal 2020 and continued to negatively affect certain of our businesses in fiscal 2021 we do not expect that it will continue to have a significant impact on our sales and operating results in the near term 

the covid19 pandemic has impacted and continues to impact our business operations globally causing disruption in our suppliers’ and customers’ supply chains some of our business locations to reduce or suspend operations and a reduction in demand for certain products from direct customers or end markets in addition the pandemic had farreaching impacts on many additional aspects of our operations both directly and indirectly including with respect to its impacts on customer behaviors business and manufacturing operations inventory our employees and the market generally we assessed the impact of the covid19 pandemic and adjusted our operations and businesses a number of which are operating as essential businesses and will continue to do so if necessary throughout our operations we implemented additional health and safety measures for the protection of our employees including providing personal protective equipment enhanced cleaning and sanitizing of our facilities and remote working arrangements

the extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our business and the markets we serve will depend on future developments which may include the further spread of the virus variant strains of the virus and the resumption of high levels of infections and hospitalizations as well as the success of public health advancements including vaccine production and distribution although we do not expect the covid19 pandemic to have a significant impact on our sales and operating results in the near term it may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 

in response to the pandemic and resulting economic environment we have taken and continue to focus on actions to manage costs these include restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives such as reducing discretionary spending 

capital expenditures and travel we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers suppliers shareholders and the communities in which we operate

for further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the covid19 pandemic see “part i item 1a risk factors”

outlook 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we expect our net sales to be approximately 37 billion as compared to 35 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 this increase is the result of sales growth in the industrial solutions and communications solutions segments partially offset by sales declines in the transportation solution segment additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments is as follows

  

we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately 150 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 this outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales of approximately 19 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2021

the above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels

we are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment including any continued impacts from the covid19 pandemic and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve we have taken actions to manage costs and will continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions additionally we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs see further discussion in “liquidity and capital resources” 

acquisitions 

during fiscal 2021 we acquired four businesses for a combined cash purchase price of 422 million net of cash acquired the acquisitions were reported as part of our industrial solutions segment from the date of acquisition

we acquired five businesses including first sensor ag “first sensor” for a combined cash purchase price of 336 million net of cash acquired during fiscal 2020 the acquisitions were reported as part of our transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments from the date of acquisition

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding acquisitions

results of operations 

net sales 

the following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by segment

 the following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by segment

 net sales increased 2751 million or 226 in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 the increase in net sales resulted primarily from organic net sales growth of 182 and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 36 due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies the significant unfavorable impacts from the covid19 pandemic were included in our net sales in fiscal 2020

see further discussion of net sales below under “segment results”

net sales by geographic region our business operates in three geographic regions—emea asia–pacific and the americas—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into us dollars at the end of each fiscal period we sell our products into approximately 140 countries and approximately 60 of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar in fiscal 2021 the percentage of net sales in fiscal 2021 by major currencies invoiced was as follows 



the following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by geographic region

 the following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by geographic region

 cost of sales and gross margin 

the following table presents cost of sales and gross margin information

 in fiscal 2021 gross margin increased 1152 million as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of higher volume and to a lesser degree improved manufacturing productivity and the positive impact of foreign currency translation 

we use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices as markets recover from the covid19 pandemic increases in consumer demand have led to shortages and price increases in some of our input materials in fiscal 2021 we purchased approximately 200 million pounds of copper 122000 troy ounces of gold 27 million troy ounces of silver and 15000 troy ounces of palladium the following table presents the average prices incurred related to copper gold silver and palladium

 ​ 

in fiscal 2022 we expect to purchase approximately 215 million pounds of copper 135000 troy ounces of gold 29 million troy ounces of silver and 15000 troy ounces of palladium

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expense information

 selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2021 selling general and administrative expenses increased 120 million as compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs due to improved operational performance increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels and the negative impact of foreign currency translation partially offset by savings attributable to cost control measures and restructuring actions and gains on the sale of real estate 

restructuring and other charges net we are committed to continuous productivity improvements and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint migrate facilities to lowercost regions reduce fixed costs and eliminate excess capacity these initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry improve our operating leverage and position us for future growth 

during fiscal 2021 and 2020 we initiated restructuring programs across all segments to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the cost structure of the organization these actions were due in part to the covid19 pandemic we incurred net restructuring charges of 208 million and 257 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2021 are expected to be approximately 80 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2023 cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 we expect total restructuring charges to be approximately 150 million and total spending which will be funded with cash from operations to be approximately 200 million

liquidity and capital resources 

our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our access to capital markets money markets or other sources of funding as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements we believe that cash generated from operations and to the extent necessary these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future we may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program to acquire strategic businesses or product lines to pay dividends on our common shares or to reduce our outstanding debt the cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions we will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions including any developments related to the covid19 pandemic for further information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the covid19 pandemic see “part i item 1a risk factors” we believe that we have sufficient financial resources and liquidity which will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital and other cash flow needs subsequent to fiscal year end 2021 tyco electronics group sa “tegsa” called for the early redemption of all of its outstanding 350 senior notes due in february 2022 representing 500 million aggregate principal amount the redemption which was funded with cash from operations was completed in november 2021

as of fiscal year end 2021 our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world under current applicable laws substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to tegsa our luxembourg subsidiary which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt and to te connectivity ltd our swiss parent company however the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense we provide for tax liabilities on the consolidated financial statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations as of fiscal year end 2021 we had approximately 49 billion of cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits principally in our subsidiaries that we have the ability to distribute to tegsa and te connectivity ltd but we consider to be permanently reinvested we estimate that up to 07 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the consolidated financial statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations including investing and financing activities

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased 685 million to 2676 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to 1991 million in fiscal 2020 the increase resulted primarily from higher pretax income partially offset by higher working capital levels to support increased sales and higher tax payments the amount of income taxes paid net of refunds during fiscal 2021 and 2020 was 371 million and 257 million respectively

pension contributions were 61 million and 47 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively we expect pension contributions to be 50 million in fiscal 2022 before consideration of any voluntary contributions for additional information regarding pensions see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures were 690 million and 560 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively we expect fiscal 2022 capital spending levels to be approximately 5 of net sales we believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities

during fiscal 2021 we acquired four businesses for a combined cash purchase price of 422 million net of cash acquired we acquired five businesses including first sensor for a combined cash purchase price of 336 million net of cash acquired during fiscal 2020 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding acquisitions

 ​ 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in certain instances we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2022 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability for 

investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

at fiscal year end 2021 we had outstanding letters of credit letters of guarantee and surety bonds of 135 million excluding those related to our subsea communications “subcom” business which are discussed below

during fiscal 2019 we sold our subcom business in connection with the sale we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the subcom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale these performance guarantees and letters of credit had a combined value of approximately 119 million as of fiscal year end 2021 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025 during fiscal 2021 we amended our agreement with subcom and removed a requirement to issue new performance guarantees for certain projects entered into by the subcom business following the sale as of fiscal year end 2021 there were no such new performance guarantees outstanding we have contractual recourse against the subcom business if we are required to perform on any subcom guarantees however based on historical experience we do not anticipate having to perform see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the subcom business

​ 

commitments and contingencies 

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable leases and other material obligations at fiscal year end 2021

 

  

legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including patent infringement claims product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon 

our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

trade compliance matters 

we are investigating our past compliance with relevant us trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the us department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” and the us state department’s directorate of defense trade controls “ddtc” we are cooperating with the bis and ddtc on these matters and both our internal assessment and the resulting investigations by the agencies remain ongoing we are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies’ investigations an unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties while we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties management’s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period

revenue recognition 

we account for revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 606 revenue from contracts with customers  our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract such as a purchase order with a customer are satisfied generally this occurs with the transfer of control we transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers the customers accept and have legal title for the product and we have a right to payment for such product revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations we apply the practical expedient of asc 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations

we generally warrant that our products will conform to our or mutually agreed to specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time we limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product we do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations

although products are generally sold at fixed prices certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards such as sales rebates return allowances scrap allowances and other rights which are accounted for as variable consideration we estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other 

intangible assets include both indeterminablelived residual goodwill and determinablelived identifiable intangible assets intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property consisting of patents trademarks and unpatented technology and customer relationships recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straightline basis evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinablelived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant

we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment a “component” if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management at fiscal year end 2021 we had five reporting units all of which contained goodwill there were two reporting units in both the transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments and one reporting unit in the communications solutions segment when changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values we review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test or more frequently based on changes in our structure

goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired in assessing a potential impairment management relies on several reporting unitspecific factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows transactions and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis

when testing for goodwill impairment we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the amount of the excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit

fair value estimates used in the goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit the income approach is supported by a guideline analysis a market approach these approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates discount rates income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our interim goodwill impairment test and partial impairment charge of 900 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and determined that no impairment existed

income taxes 

in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of pretax operating income in various tax jurisdictions the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings

changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any enacted changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 income taxes  we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets

pension plans 

our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions the funded status of our plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date the projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels the fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds held for the sole benefit of participants which are invested by the trustee of the funds the benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors such as years of service and compensation

net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants or for inactive plans over the remaining life expectancy of participants

two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and employee turnover these assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations at fiscal year end 2021 a 25basispoint decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by 127 million a 25basispoint increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by 119 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a 50basispoint decrease or increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets would have increased or decreased respectively our fiscal 2021 pension expense by 13 million

at fiscal year end 2021 the longterm target asset allocation in our us plans’ master trust is 5 returnseeking assets and 95 liabilityhedging assets asset reallocation to meet that target is occurring over a multiyear period based on the funded status we expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 115 based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2021 our target asset allocation is 67 returnseeking and 33 liabilityhedging

nongaap financial measure 

organic net sales growth decline 

we present organic net sales growth decline as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with gaap organic net sales growth decline represents net sales growth decline the most comparable gaap financial measure excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months if any organic net sales growth decline is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management’s control such as the 

impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company such as acquisition and divestiture activity

organic net sales growth decline provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate performance also management uses this measure together with gaap financial measures in its decisionmaking processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company it is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations the tables presented in “results of operations” and “segment results” provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth decline to net sales growth decline calculated in accordance with gaap

organic net sales growth decline is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with gaap this nongaap financial measure may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures reported by other companies the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results this limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth decline in combination with net sales growth decline to better understand the amounts character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts

forwardlooking information 

certain statements in this annual report are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the us private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management forwardlooking statements include among others the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations business strategies financing plans competitive position potential growth opportunities potential operating performance improvements acquisitions divestitures the effects of competition and the effects of future legislation or regulations forwardlooking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as the words “believe” “expect” “plan” “intend” “anticipate” “estimate” “predict” “potential” “continue” “may” and “should” or the negative of these terms or similar expressions

forwardlooking statements involve risks uncertainties and assumptions actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements investors should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements we do not have any intention or obligation to update forwardlooking statements after we file this report except as required by law

the following and other risks which are described in greater detail in “part i item 1a risk factors” as well as other risks described in this annual report could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward   looking statements 



 

there may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency movements on outstanding debt and nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks

we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an aa2 credit rating there is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty

foreign currency exposures 

as part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we utilize crosscurrency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions in addition we utilize crosscurrency swap contracts to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2021 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 240 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2020 market rates would have changed the 

unrealized value of our contracts by 265 million such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the losses or gains on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions

interest rate and investment exposures 

we issue debt as needed to fund our operations and capital requirements such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure to manage the interest rate exposure we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt based on our floating rate debt balance at fiscal year end 2020 a 50basispoint increase in the levels of the us dollar interest rates with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an immaterial increase in interest expense in fiscal 2020 there was no floating rate debt outstanding at fiscal year end 2021

we may use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt at fiscal year end 2021 and 2020 we had forward starting interest rate swap contracts which had an aggregate notional value of 450 million and were designated as cash flow hedges

we utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities

commodity exposures 

our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges we continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period at fiscal year end 2021 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver copper and palladium were in a net gain position of 1 million and had a notional value of 512 million at fiscal year end 2020 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver copper and palladium were in a net gain position of 41 million and had a notional value of 312 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of commodity prices from the fiscal year end 2021 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 51 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of commodity prices from the fiscal year end 2020 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 35 million

covid19 pandemic 

a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” was first identified in china in december 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health organization to date covid19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas the covid19 pandemic negatively affected our sales and operating results during fiscal 2020 and we expect that it will continue to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the near term and may have a material impact on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations in future periods see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for discussion regarding the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our financial results also see “part i item 1a risk factors” for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the covid19 pandemic

segments 

we operate through three reportable segments transportation solutions industrial solutions and communications solutions although the covid19 pandemic has negatively affected our markets we expect a gradual recovery with our three segments once again serving a combined market of approximately 190 billion

our net sales by segment as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows

 below is a description of our reportable segments and the primary products markets and competitors of each segment

transportation solutions 

the transportation solutions segment is a leader in connectivity and sensor technologies the primary products sold by the transportation solutions segment include terminals and connector systems and components sensors relays antennas application tooling and wire and heat shrink tubing the transportation solutions segment’s products which must withstand harsh conditions are used in the following end markets

 

the transportation solutions segment’s major competitors include yazaki aptiv sumitomo sensata honeywell molex and amphenol

industrial solutions 

the industrial solutions segment is a leading supplier of products that connect and distribute power data and signals the primary products sold by the industrial solutions segment include terminals and connector systems and components heat shrink tubing interventional medical components relays and wire and cable the industrial solutions segment’s products are used in the following end markets

 

the industrial solutions segment competes primarily against amphenol hubbell carlisle companies abb integer holdings esterline molex and omron

communications solutions 

the communications solutions segment is a leading supplier of electronic components for the data and devices and the appliances markets the primary products sold by the communications solutions segment include terminals and connector systems and components relays heat shrink tubing and antennas the communications solutions segment’s products are used in the following end markets

 the communications solutions segment’s major competitors include amphenol molex jst and korea electric terminal ket

customers 

as an industry leader we have established close working relationships with many of our customers these relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions by working with our customers in developing new products and technologies we believe we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about nextgeneration technology across our products

our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support we believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers

we manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries and our relationships with them typically date back many years we believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance additionally we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors

no single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2020 2019 or 2018

sales and distribution 

we maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate our net sales by geographic region 1 as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows

 



we sell our products into approximately 140 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers in fiscal 2020 our direct sales represented approximately 80 of total net sales we also sell our products indirectly via thirdparty distributors

we maintain distribution centers around the world products are generally delivered to the distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer in some instances however products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer our global coverage positions us near our customers’ locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs we contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products globally via road rail sea and air we believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile

seasonality and backlog 

typically we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business overall the third and fourth fiscal quarters are usually the strongest quarters of our fiscal year whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets

certain of our end markets experience some seasonality our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production and seasonal declines in european production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter also our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases

customer orders and demand may fluctuate as a result of economic and market conditions we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations as a result of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic backlog by reportable segment was as follows

 we expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2020 will be filled during fiscal 2021 backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods

competition 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers competition is generally based on breadth of product offering product innovation price quality delivery and service we have experienced and expect to continue to experience downward pressure on prices

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products the principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding precious metals such as gold and silver for plating and other metals such as copper aluminum brass and steel for manufacturing cable contacts and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers the prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand

intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including patents and patent applications as available in an effort to 

develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others

we own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical optical and electronic products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks

while we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents

human capital management 

we have employees located throughout the world as of fiscal year end 2020 we employed approximately 82000 people worldwide including contract employees approximately 22000 were in the asia–pacific region 31000 were in the emea region and 29000 were in the americas region of our total employees approximately 52000 were employed in manufacturing our strong employee base along with their commitment to uncompromising values provides the foundation of our company’s success 

our employees are responsible for upholding our purpose—to create a safer sustainable productive and connected future our values—integrity accountability teamwork and innovation and our strategy execution and talent “set” leadership expectations we track and report internally on key talent metrics including workforce demographics critical role pipeline data diversity data and engagement and inclusion indices 

we embrace diversity and inclusion a truly innovative workforce needs to be diverse and leverage the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds and experiences to attract a global workforce we strive to embed a culture where employees can bring their whole selves to work our employee resource groups “ergs” are companysponsored groups of employees that support and promote certain mutual objectives of both the employees and the company including inclusion and diversity and the professional development of employees the ergs provide a space where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment as of fiscal year end 2020 we had six ergs—align lgbtq women in networking te young professionals african heritage te veterans and asian heritage we are focused on recruitment of diverse candidates and on internal talent development of our diverse leaders so that they can advance their careers and move into leadership positions within the company also during fiscal 2020 we conducted a fully digital enterprisewide engagement survey our every connection counts survey which was available in 13 languages and focused on measuring engagement and inclusion 

we continue to emphasize employee development and training to empower employees to unleash their potential we provide a range of development programs and opportunities skills and resources they need to be successful our learnte platform supplements our talent development strategies it is an online portal that enables employees to access instructorled classroom or virtual courses and selfdirected webbased courses in fiscal 2019 we launched set leadership expectations to all employees which focus on how we drive strategy effectively execute and build talent we believe these behavioral expectations are integrated into the way we assess and select talent manage performance and develop our people we are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation leaders we have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established specialized programs to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in general management engineering and operations on an annual basis we conduct an organization and leadership review process with our chief executive officer and all segment business unit and function leaders focusing on our high performing and high potential talent diverse talent and the succession for our most critical roles 

we believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership our chief executive officer and segment leaders average approximately 25 years of industry experience they are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry for discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees see “part 1 item 1a risk factors”

government regulation and supervision 

the import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events we have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction

environmental 

our operations are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment greenhouse gas emissions hazardous materials in products and chemical usage we are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment we maintain a global environmental health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards staff dedicated to environmental health and safety issues periodic compliance auditing training and other measures we also have a program for compliance with the european union “eu” restriction of hazardous substances and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the china restriction of hazardous substances law the eu registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulation and similar laws

compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future for example laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection management and reporting and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products we also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations based upon our experience available information and applicable laws as of fiscal year end 2020 we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of 16 million to 45 million and we accrued 20 million as the probable loss which was the best estimate within this range we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2021 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions

 item 1a risk factors 

investors should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities these risks are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations financial condition and liquidity many of the risks listed below are and will be exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic and any worsening of the economic environment 

risks relating to the macroeconomic environment and our global presence 

conditions in global or regional economies capital and money markets and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit end demand from consumer and industrial markets and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults any of these economic factors could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow and ability to obtain financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full further our vendors may experience similar problems which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels if regional or global economic conditions deteriorate our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected also deterioration in economic conditions expectations for future revenue projected future cash flows or other factors have triggered and could trigger additional recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other longlived assets impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in united states “us” dollars however a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue approximately 60 of our net sales for fiscal 2020 were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect nonus dollar revenue to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net sales we have elected not to hedge this foreign currency exposure therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro or asian currencies our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease

we manage certain cash intercompany and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts in addition to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to these contracts our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful

we have suffered and could continue to suffer significant business interruptions including impacts resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

our operations and those of our suppliers and customers and the supply chains that support their operations may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis typhoons tornados or floods other disasters such as fires explosions acts of terrorism or war or disease or other adverse health developments including impacts resulting from the covid19 pandemic or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes in addition such interruptions could result in a widespread crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our end customers’ products if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected the covid19 pandemic is currently impacting countries communities workforces supply chains and markets around the world and as a result we have experienced disruptions and restrictions on our employees’ ability to travel as well as temporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers suppliers and other vendors in our supply chain as a 

result of the covid19 pandemic some of our employees have transitioned to working from home on a fulltime or parttime basis which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks the covid19 pandemic has had and we expect that it will continue to have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the near term and may have a material impact on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations in future periods the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will further impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted such developments may include the further spread of the virus to additional persons and geographic regions the severity of the virus the duration of the pandemic the impact on our suppliers’ and customers’ supply chains and financial positions including their ability to pay us the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak in jurisdictions in which we operate and the possible impact on the global economy and local economies in which we operate further to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations or financial condition it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section

we could be adversely affected by a decline in the market value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets 

concerns about deterioration in the global economy together with concerns about credit inflation or deflation have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities including fixed income and equity securities which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios in addition the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved a decrease in the value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding 

the global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital as a result we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures the extent of any impact will depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions

we are subject to global risks of political economic and military instability 

our workforce manufacturing research administrative and sales facilities markets customers and suppliers are located throughout the world as a result we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including



 we have sizeable operations in china including 17 principal manufacturing sites in addition approximately 20 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 were made to customers in china economic conditions in china have been and may continue to be volatile and uncertain in addition the legal and regulatory system in china is still developing and subject to change accordingly our operations and transactions with customers in china could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions changes to the regulatory environment or interpretation of chinese law

in addition any downgrade by rating agencies of longterm us sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions which could negatively affect our business financial condition and liquidity

changes in us federal tax laws could result in adverse consequences to us persons treated as owning 10 or more of our shares 

although we are a swiss corporation recent us tax law changes have expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules and cause certain of our nonus subsidiaries to be treated as controlled foreign corporations “cfcs” for us federal income tax purposes a us person that is treated for us federal income tax purposes as owning directly indirectly or constructively 10 or more of our shares may be required to annually report and include in its us taxable income its pro rata share of certain types of income earned by our subsidiaries that are treated as cfcs whether or not we make any distributions to such us shareholder a us person that owns 10 or more of our shares should consult a tax adviser regarding the potential implications to it of these changes in us federal income tax law the risk of us federal income tax reporting and compliance obligations with respect to our subsidiaries that now are treated as cfcs may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us and others from investing in us which could impact the demand for and value of our shares

risks relating to the industry in which we operate 

we are dependent on the automotive and other industries 

we are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products and our operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets periodic downturns in our customers’ industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

approximately 40 of our net sales for fiscal 2020 were to customers in the automotive industry the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers additionally the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions as a supplier of automotive electronics products our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic or credit conditions and changes in the operations products business models partsourcing requirements financial condition and market share of automotive manufacturers as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers

during fiscal 2020 approximately 10 of our net sales were to customers in the aerospace defense oil and gas end market 9 of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market and 9 of our net sales were to customers in the commercial transportation market the aerospace and defense industry has undergone significant fluctuations in demand as a result of economic and political conditions including the impact of the covid19 pandemic demand in the oil and gas market is impacted by oil price volatility the industrial equipment industry is dependent upon economic conditions including customer investment in factory automation intelligent buildings and process control systems as well as market conditions in the rail transportation solar and lighting and other major industrial markets we 

serve demand in the commercial transportation industry is impacted by the economic environment and market conditions in the heavy truck construction agriculture and recreational vehicle markets 

we encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry 

we operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on various factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology our ability to participate in emerging markets and customers’ expectations relating to socially responsible operations the competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large diversified manufacturers to small highly specialized manufacturers the electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities a number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may have the benefit of lower production costs for certain products we cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue 

substantially all markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences which are rapid in certain end markets our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design develop introduce and sell new and innovative products to modify existing products and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change there are numerous risks inherent in these processes including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands

like other suppliers to the electronics industry we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices 

we have historically experienced and we expect to continue to experience continuing pressure to lower our prices in recent years we have experienced price erosion averaging from 1 to 2 each year to maintain our margins we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts we cannot provide assurance that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows

we may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate 

many of the industries to which we sell our products as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials have become more concentrated in recent years including the automotive data and devices and aerospace and defense industries consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us in addition as our customers buy in larger volumes their volume buying power has increased enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing these trends may adversely affect the margins on our products particularly for commodity components

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short 

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle as a result the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment if we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

risks relating to our operations 

our results are sensitive to raw material availability quality and cost 

we are a large buyer of resins chemicals additives and metals including copper gold silver aluminum brass steel and zinc many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers in addition the prices of many of these raw materials continue to fluctuate if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are significant price increases for these raw materials it could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers our margins may decline materially affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices the success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials we could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate

in accordance with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use tin tantalum tungsten or gold “conflict minerals” or “3tg” mined from the democratic republic of the congo “drc” and adjoining countries together with the drc the “covered countries” in their products these requirements as well as new and additional regulations like the eu’s conflict minerals regulation could affect the sourcing pricing and availability of 3tg used in the manufacture of certain of our products and may result in only a limited pool of suppliers who can demonstrate that they do not source any 3tg from the covered countries accordingly we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain nonconflict 3tg in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures

we may use components and products manufactured by third parties 

we may rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we may rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if these third parties fail to deliver quality products parts and components on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged

our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain management and executive management employees 

our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our management and executive management employees and hire new management and executive management employees to replace succeed or add to members of our management team our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for management talent is intense and any difficulties we may have to retain or hire members of management to achieve our objectives may have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or violations of data privacy laws could interfere with our operations compromise confidential information and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise information belonging to us our employees customers and suppliers and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation in the normal course of business we rely on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally we collect and store certain data including proprietary business information and customer and employee data and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls specifically we are subject to the laws of various states and countries where we operate or do business related to solicitation collection processing transferring storing or use of consumer customer vendor or 

employee information or related data including the eu’s general data protection regulation which went into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 which went into effect in january 2020 in addition several other countries in which we operate or do business such as china have enacted or are considering enacting laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions if countries in which we operate or do business adopt data localization or data residency laws we could be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols build new storage facilities andor devote additional resources to comply with the requirements of such laws any of which could have significant cost implications

despite our cybersecurity measures including employee and thirdparty training monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems which are continuously reviewed and upgraded to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters pandemics including covid19 or other catastrophic events in recent years we have been the target of attempted cyber intrusions and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our information technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our employees’ customers’ and suppliers’ data security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or violations of data privacy laws could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in operations and damage to our reputation which could materially adversely affect our business while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure to date none of these threats have had a material impact on our business or operations in addition as a result of the covid19 pandemic some of our employees have transitioned to working from home on a fulltime or parttime basis which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our fiveyear unsecured senior revolving credit facility “credit facility” contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens our outstanding notes’ indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate merge and sell assets

although none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations our continued ability to meet the credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant a breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our credit facility if the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors including



 risks relating to strategic transactions 

future acquisitions may not be successful 

we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings and we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years we anticipate that we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy we cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future we also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity 

if we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements this acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to complete an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares

divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered

risks relating to intellectual property litigation and regulations 

our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology 

the electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights within this industry companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights depending on the importance of the technology product patent trademark or trade secret in question an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the normal course of business we are from time to time a defendant in litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights anticompetitive behavior product liability breach of contract and employmentrelated claims in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

if any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations our business may suffer 

our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the us and the eu these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we may also be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification to be lawful and enforceable if we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements whether at all or in material part our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected further any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom’s bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom’s bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance program we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation government enforcement actions and reputational risk 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate and where our products are sold these laws and regulations govern among other things

 we may not have been or we may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators in 

addition environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance requirements

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigation removal and remediation costs under certain federal and state laws is retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notifications from the us environmental protection agency other environmental agencies and third parties that conditions at a number of currently and formerlyowned or operated sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites we also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation andor remediation is necessary

while we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury property damage andor cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities

our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage hazardous material content and recycling 

the eu china and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal use of hazardous materials in products use of chemicals in manufacturing recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters these laws include but are not limited to the eu restriction of hazardous substances end of life vehicle and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the eu reach regulation and the china law on management methods for controlling pollution by electronic information products these laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes registration chemical testing labeling and other matters these laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale these laws could make the manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions and could result in liability for product recalls penalties or other claims

risks relating to our swiss jurisdiction of incorporation 

as a swiss corporation we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares 

as a swiss corporation our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements in addition our articles of association allow us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors but this authorization is limited to i authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years which authorization period ends on march 11 2022 approved by our shareholders at our march 11 2020 annual general meeting of shareholders and ii conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation dividends andor voting moreover under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convene a meeting of shareholders which would delay the timing to execute such actions such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management while we 

do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors

we might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

we anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes in order to make the distributions on our shares to shareholders free of swiss withholding tax various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital or that swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors

currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

under swiss law the registered share capital in our unconsolidated swiss statutory financial statements is required to be denominated in swiss francs although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in us dollars shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital if the us dollar were to increase in value relative to the swiss franc the us dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without swiss withholding tax will decrease

we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares 

the swiss code of obligations regulates a corporation’s ability to hold or repurchase its own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation additionally various corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to repurchase our shares our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors

registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings 

our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by swiss law for swiss companies like us that issue registered shares as opposed to bearer shares this provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights holders of our shares must be registered in our share register aktienbuch as shareholders with voting rights only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders’ meetings but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends distributions preemptive rights advance subscription rights and liquidation proceeds the board of directors may in its discretion refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements in our articles of association additionally various proposals in switzerland for corporate law changes if passed in the future may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and banks such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors

certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable 

our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered “antitakeover” provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors under these provisions among others

 these provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital in either case representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in case of issuances from authorized capital until march 11 2022 unless reauthorized by shareholders for a subsequent twoyear period without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders’ preemptive rights or advance subscription rights for the purpose of the defense of an actual threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid in relation to which the board of directors upon consultation with an independent financial advisor has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders we note that swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital in addition the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which our shares are listed requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power with limited exceptions

global legislative and regulatory actions and proposals could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

various legislative and regulatory proposals have been directed at multinational companies with operations in lowertax jurisdictions there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives such as

 if these proposals are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business they could among other things cause double taxation increase audit risk and materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us

legislation in the us could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to us companies that have moved to lowertax jurisdictions

we expect the us congress to continue to consider implementation andor expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad we cannot predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals therefore we cannot provide assurance that any such 

legislative action will not apply to us in addition we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to us federal or state governments or the willingness of our nongovernmental customers to do business with us as a result of these uncertainties we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us

swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

as we are organized under the laws of switzerland it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us and switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws would not be allowed in swiss courts as they are contrary to switzerland’s public policy

swiss law differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers thus holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax in addition we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims at any given time in the normal course of business we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions if infringement of a third party’s patent were to be determined against us we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products if a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our consolidated balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge which could be significant in amount

management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

summary of fiscal 2020 performance 



 

covid19 pandemic and economic conditions 

a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” was first identified in china in december 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health organization to date covid19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas the covid19 pandemic negatively affected our sales and operating results during fiscal 2020 and we expect that it will continue to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the near term and may have a material impact on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations in future periods 

the covid19 pandemic is currently impacting and we expect that it will continue to impact our business operations globally causing potential disruption in our suppliers’ and customers’ supply chains some of our business locations to reduce or suspend operations and a reduction in demand for certain products from direct customers or end markets while a number of our businesses are operating as essential businesses some have had and continue to have adjusted reduced or suspended operating activities at certain locations in addition the covid19 pandemic may have farreaching impacts on many additional aspects of our operations directly and indirectly including with respect to its impacts on customer behaviors business and manufacturing operations inventory our employees and the market generally and the scope and nature of these impacts continue to evolve each day we expect to continue to assess the evolving impact of the covid19 pandemic and intend to adjust our operations accordingly for example throughout our operations we have enacted additional health and safety measures for the protection of our employees including providing personal protective equipment enhanced cleaning and sanitizing of our facilities and remote working arrangements

we expect that the covid19 pandemic will continue to impact several of the markets we serve in particular the automotive and commercial aerospace markets we expect these markets to decline in the near term relative to fiscal 2020 and they may decline in future periods however despite these market declines we expect a slight increase in our total net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020 see “outlook” below for additional information 

in response to the current economic environment and our sales declines relative to fiscal 2019 we have taken and continue to focus on actions to manage costs these include restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives such as reducing discretionary spending cutting capital expenditures reducing travel and furloughing certain employees we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers suppliers shareholders and the communities in which we operate

for further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the covid19 pandemic see “part i item 1a risk factors”

outlook 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we expect our net sales to be approximately 32 billion as compared to 317 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 this represents a slight increase resulting from sales growth in the transportation solutions and communications solutions segments partially offset by sales declines in the industrial solutions segment additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments is as follows



  

we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately 083 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 this outlook reflects the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately 55 million and 004 per share respectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2020

the above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels

we are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve including developments related to the covid19 pandemic we have taken actions to manage costs and will continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions additionally we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs see further discussion in “liquidity and capital resources” 

acquisitions 

during fiscal 2020 we acquired approximately 72 of the outstanding shares of first sensor for €181 million in cash equivalent to 201 million using an exchange rate of 111 per €100 net of cash acquired this business has been reported as part of our transportation solutions segment from the date of acquisition

we acquired four additional businesses for a combined cash purchase price of 135 million net of cash acquired during fiscal 2020 the acquisitions were reported as part of our transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments from the date of acquisition

during fiscal 2019 we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of 296 million net of cash acquired the acquisitions were reported as part of our transportation solutions segment from the date of acquisition

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding acquisitions

discontinued operations 

in fiscal 2019 we sold our subsea communications “subcom” business for net cash proceeds of 297 million and incurred a pretax loss on sale of 86 million the subcom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been reported as such in all periods presented on our consolidated financial statements prior to reclassification to discontinued operations the subcom business was included in the communications solutions segment

see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations

results of operations 

net sales 

the following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by segment

 the following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by segment

 net sales decreased 1276 million or 95 in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 the decrease in net sales resulted from organic net sales declines of 99 and the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 08 due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies partially offset by sales contributions from acquisitions of 12 price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by 173 million in fiscal 2020 in fiscal 2020 our net sales declines included significant unfavorable impacts from the covid19 pandemic

see further discussion of net sales below under “segment results”

net sales by geographic region our business operates in three geographic regions—asia–pacific emea and the americas—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into us dollars at the end of each fiscal period we sell our products into approximately 140 countries and approximately 60 of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar in fiscal 2020 the percentage of net sales in fiscal 2020 by major currencies invoiced was as follows 



the following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by geographic region

 the following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by geographic region

 cost of sales and gross margin 

the following table presents cost of sales and gross margin information

 in fiscal 2020 gross margin decreased 659 million as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily as a result of lower volume and to a lesser degree price erosion and lower manufacturing productivity partially offset by lower material costs 

we use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices which continue to fluctuate for many of the raw materials we use including copper gold and silver in fiscal 2020 we purchased approximately 160 million pounds of copper 107000 troy ounces of gold and 22 million troy ounces of silver the following table presents the average prices incurred related to copper gold and silver

 ​ 

in fiscal 2021 we expect to purchase approximately 155 million pounds of copper 105000 troy ounces of gold and 22 million troy ounces of silver

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expense information

 selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2020 selling general and administrative expenses decreased 98 million as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to reduced selling expenses cost control measures and savings attributable to restructuring actions 

restructuring and other charges net we are committed to continuous productivity improvements and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint migrate facilities to lowercost regions reduce fixed costs and eliminate excess capacity these initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry improve our operating leverage and position us for future growth 

during fiscal 2020 and 2019 we initiated restructuring programs associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments the fiscal 2020 actions were due in part to the covid19 pandemic we incurred net restructuring charges of 257 million and 255 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2020 are expected to be approximately 200 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2022 cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2021 we currently expect total restructuring charges to be approximately 200 million and total spending which will be funded with cash from operations to be approximately 250 million

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges

impairment of goodwill as a result of current and projected declines in sales and profitability due in part to the impact of the covid19 pandemic and projected reductions in global automotive production as of march 2020 of the sensors reporting unit of the transportation solutions segment during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we determined that an indicator of impairment had occurred and goodwill impairment testing of this reporting unit was required

as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we adopted accounting standards update “asu” no 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 of the goodwill impairment test under the new standard goodwill impairment is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill we determined the fair value of the sensors reporting unit to be 10 billion as of march 27 2020 this valuation was based on a discounted cash flows analysis incorporating our estimate of future operating performance which we consider to be a level 3 unobservable input in the fair value hierarchy and was corroborated using a market approach valuation the goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value by 900 million as a result we recorded a partial impairment charge of 900 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as of fiscal year end 2020 the sensors reporting unit had a remaining goodwill allocation of 511 million see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the impairment of goodwill and our annual goodwill impairment test

 operating income included the following

 

 

see discussion of operating income below under “segment results”

nonoperating items 

the following table presents select nonoperating information

 interest expense interest expense decreased 20 million during fiscal 2020 due primarily to a lower cost of debt and our crosscurrency swap program that hedges our net investment in certain foreign operations the aggregate notional value of the contracts under this program was 1664 million at fiscal year end 2020 under the terms of these contracts we receive interest in us dollars at a weightedaverage rate of 24 per annum and pay no interest see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our crosscurrency swap program 

income taxes see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of items impacting income tax expense benefit and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 and 2019 including the switzerland federal act on tax reform and ahv financing “swiss tax reform” increases to the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and the termination of the tax sharing agreement

liquidity and capital resources 

our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets money markets or other sources of funding as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements we believe that cash generated from operations and to the extent necessary these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future including the payments of 250 million of 4875 senior notes due in january 2021 and €350 million of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due in june 2021 and compensation payments to first sensor minority shareholders we may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program to acquire strategic businesses or product lines to pay dividends on our common shares or to reduce our outstanding debt the cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions we will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions including future developments related to the covid19 pandemic there is uncertainty surrounding the duration and scope of the covid19 pandemic and it may have a material impact on our liquidity and financial conditions we believe that we have sufficient financial resources and liquidity which along with managing expenses and capital structure flexibility will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital and other cash flow needs during the covid19 pandemic and resulting period of economic uncertainty which included reduced sales and net 

income levels for us in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 and may include reduced sales and income levels in future periods for further information on the risks and uncertainties associated with the covid19 pandemic see “part i item 1a risk factors”

as of fiscal year end 2020 our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world under current applicable laws substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to tyco electronics group sa “tegsa” our luxembourg subsidiary which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt and to te connectivity ltd our swiss parent company however the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense we provide for tax liabilities on the consolidated financial statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations as of fiscal year end 2020 we had approximately 53 billion of cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits principally in our subsidiaries that we have the ability to distribute to tegsa and te connectivity ltd but we consider to be permanently reinvested we estimate that up to 08 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the consolidated financial statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations including investing and financing activities

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities decreased 463 million to 1991 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to 2454 million in fiscal 2019 the decrease resulted primarily from lower pretax income levels 

the amount of income taxes paid net of refunds during fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 257 million and 338 million respectively we do not expect a significant change in our income tax payments as a result of swiss tax reform see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding swiss tax reform

pension contributions were 47 million and 45 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect pension contributions to be 69 million in fiscal 2021 before consideration of any voluntary contributions for additional information regarding pensions see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures were 560 million and 749 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect fiscal 2021 capital spending levels to be approximately 5 of net sales we believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities

during fiscal 2020 we acquired five businesses including first sensor for a combined cash purchase price of 336 million net of cash acquired during fiscal 2019 we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of 296 million net of cash acquired see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding acquisitions

 ​ 

commitments and contingencies 

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable leases and other obligations at fiscal year end 2020

 

 

 

legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including patent infringement claims product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in certain instances we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2021 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

at fiscal year end 2020 we had outstanding letters of credit letters of guarantee and surety bonds of 249 million

as discussed above in fiscal 2019 we sold our subcom business in connection with the sale we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the subcom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale these guarantees had a combined value of approximately 600 million as of fiscal year end 2020 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025 also under the terms of the definitive agreement we are required to issue up to 300 million of new performance guarantees subject to certain limitations for projects entered into by the subcom business following the sale for a period of up to three years at fiscal year end 2020 there were no such new performance guarantees outstanding we have contractual recourse against the subcom business if we are required to perform on any subcom guarantees however based on historical experience we do not anticipate having to perform see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the subcom business

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties management’s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period

revenue recognition 

we account for revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 606 revenue from contracts with customers  our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract such as a purchase order with a customer are satisfied generally this occurs with the transfer of control we transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers the customers accept and have legal title for the product and we have a right to payment for such product revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities our credit terms are customary and do 

not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations we apply the practical expedient of asc 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as of fiscal year end 2020

we generally warrant that our products will conform to our or mutually agreed to specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time we limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product we do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations

although products are generally sold at fixed prices certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards such as sales rebates return allowances scrap allowances and other rights which are accounted for as variable consideration we estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  as updated by asu no 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment 

intangible assets include both indeterminablelived residual goodwill and determinablelived identifiable intangible assets intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property consisting of patents trademarks and unpatented technology and customer relationships recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straightline basis evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinablelived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant

we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment a “component” if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management at fiscal year end 2020 we had five reporting units all of which contained goodwill there were two reporting units in both the transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments and one reporting unit in the communications solutions segment when changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values we review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test or more frequently based on changes in our structure

goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred in assessing the existence of a triggering event management relies on several reporting unitspecific factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows transactions and marketplace data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis

when testing for goodwill impairment we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the amount of the excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit

fair value estimates used in the goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit the income approach is supported by guideline analyses a market approach these approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates discount rates income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our early adoption of asu 201704 our interim goodwill impairment test and partial impairment charge of 900 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 

2020 we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and determined that no impairment existed

income taxes 

in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of pretax operating income in various tax jurisdictions the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings

changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 income taxes  we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets

pension plans 

our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions the funded status of our plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date the projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels the fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds held for the sole benefit of participants which are invested by the trustee of the funds the benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors such as years of service and compensation

net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants or for inactive plans over the remaining life expectancy of participants

two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and employee turnover these assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for high

quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations at fiscal year end 2020 a 25basispoint decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by 143 million a 25basispoint increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by 131 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a 50basispoint decrease or increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets would have increased or decreased respectively our fiscal 2020 pension expense by 12 million

at fiscal year end 2020 the longterm target asset allocation in our us plans’ master trust is 5 returnseeking assets and 95 liabilityhedging assets asset reallocation to meet that target is occurring over a multiyear period based on the funded status we expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 115 based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2020 our target asset allocation is 67 returnseeking and 33 liabilityhedging

accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently adopted accounting pronouncements

nongaap financial measure 

organic net sales growth decline 

we present organic net sales growth decline as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with gaap organic net sales growth decline represents net sales growth decline the most comparable gaap financial measure excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months if any organic net sales growth decline is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management’s control such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company such as acquisition and divestiture activity

organic net sales growth decline provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate performance also management uses this measure together with gaap financial measures in its decisionmaking processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company it is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations the tables presented in “results of operations” and “segment results” provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth decline to net sales growth decline calculated in accordance with gaap

organic net sales growth decline is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with gaap this nongaap financial measure may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures reported by other companies the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results this limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth decline in combination with net sales growth decline to better understand the amounts character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts

forwardlooking information 

certain statements in this annual report are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the us private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management forwardlooking statements include among others the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations business strategies financing plans competitive position potential growth opportunities potential operating performance improvements acquisitions divestitures the effects of competition and the effects of future legislation or regulations forwardlooking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as the words “believe” “expect” “plan” “intend” “anticipate” “estimate” “predict” “potential” “continue” “may” and “should” or the negative of these terms or similar expressions

forwardlooking statements involve risks uncertainties and assumptions actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements investors should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements we do not have any intention or obligation to update forwardlooking statements after we file this report except as required by law

the following and other risks which are described in greater detail in “part i item 1a risk factors” as well as other risks described in this annual report could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward   looking statements 

 

there may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency movements on outstanding debt and nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks

we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an aa2 credit rating there is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty

foreign currency exposures 

as part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we utilize crosscurrency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions in addition we utilize crosscurrency swap contracts to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2020 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 265 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2019 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 282 million such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the losses or gains on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions

interest rate and investment exposures 

we issue debt as needed to fund our operations and capital requirements such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure to manage the interest rate exposure we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt based on our floating rate debt balances at fiscal year end 2020 and 2019 a 50basispoint increase in the levels of the us dollar interest rates with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an immaterial increase in interest expense in both fiscal 2020 and 2019

we may use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt at fiscal year end 2020 and 2019 we had forward starting interest rate swap contracts which had an aggregate notional value of 450 million and 350 million respectively and were designated as cash flow hedges

we utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities

commodity exposures 

our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges we continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period at fiscal year end 2020 our commodity hedges which related primarily to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net gain position of 41 million and had a notional value of 312 million at fiscal year end 2019 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net gain position of 1 million and had a notional value of 316 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of commodity prices from the fiscal year end 2020 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 35 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of commodity prices from the fiscal year end 2019 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 32 million

customers 

as an industry leader we have established close working relationships with many of our customers these relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions by working with our customers in developing new products and technologies we believe we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about nextgeneration technology across our products

our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support we believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers

we manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries and our relationships with them typically date back many years we believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance additionally we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors

no single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2019 2018 or 2017

sales and distribution 

we maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate our net sales by geographic region 1 as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows

 

 we sell our products into approximately 150 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers in fiscal 2019 our direct sales represented approximately 80 of total net sales we also sell our products indirectly via thirdparty distributors

we maintain distribution centers around the world products are generally delivered to the distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer in some instances however products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer our global coverage positions us near our customers’ locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs we contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products globally via road rail sea and air we believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile

seasonality and backlog 

we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business overall the third and fourth fiscal quarters are typically the strongest quarters of our fiscal year whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets

certain of our end markets experience some seasonality our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production and seasonal declines in european production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter also our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases

customer orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business and market conditions backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods backlog by reportable segment was as follows

 we expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2019 will be filled during fiscal 2020

competition 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers competition is generally based on breadth of product offering product innovation price quality delivery and service our markets have generally been growing but with downward pressure on prices

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products the principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding precious metals such as gold and silver for plating and other metals such as copper aluminum brass and steel for manufacturing cable contacts and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers the prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand

intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including patents and patent applications as available in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others

we own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical optical and electronic products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks

while we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents

management team and employees 

we believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership our chief executive officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience they are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry

our strong employee base along with their commitment to uncompromising values provides the foundation of our company’s success we continue to emphasize employee development and training and we embrace diversity and inclusion

we have employees located throughout the world as of fiscal year end 2019 we employed approximately 78000 people worldwide of whom 31000 were in the emea region 22000 were in the asia–pacific region and 25000 were in the americas region of our total employees approximately 49000 were employed in manufacturing

government regulation and supervision 

the import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events we have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction

environmental 

our operations are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment greenhouse gas emissions hazardous materials in products and chemical usage we are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment we maintain a global environmental health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards staff dedicated to environmental health and safety issues periodic compliance auditing training and other measures we also have a program for compliance with the european union “eu” restriction of hazardous substances and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the china restriction of hazardous substances law the eu registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulation and similar laws

compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future for example laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection management and reporting and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products we also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations based upon our experience available information and applicable laws as of fiscal year end 2019 we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of 15 million to 43 million and we accrued 18 million as the probable loss which was the best estimate within this range we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2020 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions

 item 1a risk factors 

investors should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities these risks are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations financial condition and liquidity 

risks relating to the macroeconomic environment and our global presence 

conditions in global or regional economies capital and money markets and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit end demand from consumer and industrial markets and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults any of these economic factors could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow and ability to obtain financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full further our vendors may experience similar problems which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels if regional or global economic conditions deteriorate our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected also deterioration in economic conditions could trigger the recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other longlived assets impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in united states “us” dollars however a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue approximately 60 of our net sales for fiscal 2019 were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect nonus dollar revenue to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net sales we have elected not to hedge this foreign currency exposure therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro or asian currencies our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease

we manage certain cash intercompany and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts in addition to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to these contracts our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful

we could suffer significant business interruptions 

our operations and those of our suppliers and customers and the supply chains that support their operations may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis typhoons or floods or other disasters such as fires explosions acts of terrorism or war disease or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

we could be adversely affected by a decline in the market value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets 

concerns about deterioration in the global economy together with concerns about credit inflation or deflation have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities including fixed income and equity securities which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios in addition the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved a decrease in the value of our pension plans’ investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding 

the global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital as a result we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures the extent of any impact will depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions

we are subject to global risks of political economic and military instability 

our workforce manufacturing research administrative and sales facilities markets customers and suppliers are located throughout the world as a result we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including

 we have sizeable operations in china including 18 principal manufacturing sites in addition approximately 18 of our net sales in fiscal 2019 were made to customers in china economic conditions in china have been and may continue to be volatile and uncertain in addition the legal and regulatory system in china is still developing and subject to change accordingly our operations and transactions with customers in china could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions changes to the regulatory environment or interpretation of chinese law

in addition any downgrade by rating agencies of longterm us sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions which could negatively affect our business financial condition and liquidity

changes in us federal tax laws could result in adverse consequences to us persons treated as owning 10 or more of our shares 

although we are a swiss corporation recent us tax law changes have expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules and cause certain of our nonus subsidiaries to be treated as controlled foreign corporations “cfcs” for us federal income tax purposes a us person that is treated for us federal income tax purposes as owning directly indirectly or constructively 10 or more of our shares may be required to annually report and include in its us taxable income its pro rata share of certain types of income earned by our subsidiaries that are treated as cfcs whether or not we make any distributions to such us shareholder a us person that owns 10 or more of our shares should consult a tax adviser regarding the potential implications to it of these changes in us federal income tax law the risk of us federal income tax reporting and compliance obligations with respect to our subsidiaries that now are treated as cfcs may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us and others from investing in us which could impact the demand for and value of our shares

risks relating to the industry in which we operate 

we are dependent on the automotive and other industries 

we are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products and our operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets periodic downturns in our customers’ industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

approximately 42 of our net sales for fiscal 2019 were to customers in the automotive industry the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers additionally the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions as a supplier of automotive electronics products our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic or credit conditions and changes in the operations products business models partsourcing requirements financial condition and market share of automotive manufacturers as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers

during fiscal 2019 approximately 14 of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market 10 of our net sales were to customers in the aerospace defense oil and gas end market and 9 of our net sales were to customers in the commercial transportation market demand for industrial equipment is dependent upon economic conditions including customer investment in factory automation intelligent buildings and process control systems as well as market conditions in the medical rail transportation solar and lighting and other major industrial markets we serve the aerospace and defense industry has undergone significant fluctuations in demand depending on worldwide economic and political conditions demand in the oil and gas market is impacted by oil price volatility the commercial transportation industry can experience variability in demand depending on the economic environment and market conditions in the heavy truck construction agriculture and recreational vehicle markets 

we encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry 

we operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on various factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology our ability to participate in emerging markets and customers’ expectations relating to socially responsible operations the competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large diversified manufacturers to small highly specialized manufacturers the electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities a number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may have the benefit of lower production costs for certain products we cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue 

substantially all markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences which are rapid in certain end markets our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design develop introduce and sell new and innovative products to modify existing products and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change there are numerous risks inherent in these processes including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands

like other suppliers to the electronics industry we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices 

we have historically experienced and we expect to continue to experience continuing pressure to lower our prices in recent years we have experienced price erosion averaging from 1 to 2 each year to maintain our margins we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts we cannot provide assurance that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows

we may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate 

many of the industries to which we sell our products as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials have become more concentrated in recent years including the automotive data and devices and aerospace and defense industries consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us in addition as our customers buy in larger volumes their volume buying power has increased enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing these trends may adversely affect the margins on our products particularly for commodity components

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short 

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle as a result the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment if we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

risks relating to our operations 

our results are sensitive to raw material availability quality and cost 

we are a large buyer of resins chemicals additives and metals including copper gold silver aluminum brass steel and zinc many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers in addition the prices of many of these raw materials continue to fluctuate if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are significant price increases for these raw materials it could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers our margins may decline materially affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices the success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials we could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate

in accordance with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use tin tantalum tungsten or gold “conflict minerals” or “3tg” mined from the democratic republic of the congo “drc” and adjoining countries together with the drc the “covered countries” in their products these requirements could affect the sourcing pricing and availability of 3tg used in the manufacture of certain of our products and may result in only a limited pool of suppliers who can demonstrate that they do not source any 3tg from the covered countries accordingly we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain nonconflict 3tg in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices further since our supply chain is complex we may face 

reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures

we may use components and products manufactured by third parties 

we may rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we may rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if these third parties fail to deliver quality products parts and components on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged

our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain management and executive management employees 

our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our management and executive management employees and hire new management and executive management employees to replace succeed or add to members of our management team our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for management talent is intense and any difficulties we may have to retain or hire members of management to achieve our objectives may have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise confidential information and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise information belonging to us our employees customers and suppliers and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation in the normal course of business we rely on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally we collect and store certain data including proprietary business information and customer and employee data and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our cybersecurity measures including employee and thirdparty training monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems which are continuously reviewed and upgraded to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in operations and damage to our reputation which could materially adversely affect our business while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure to date none of these threats have had a material impact on our business or operations

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our fiveyear unsecured senior revolving credit facility “credit facility” contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens our outstanding notes’ indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate merge and sell assets

although none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations our continued ability to meet the credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant a breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our credit facility if the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness acceleration 

of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors including

 risks relating to strategic transactions 

future acquisitions may not be successful 

we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings and we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years we anticipate that we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy we cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future we also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity 

if we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements this acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to complete an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares

divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered

risks relating to intellectual property litigation and regulations 

our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology 

the electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights within this industry companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights depending on the importance of the technology product patent trademark or trade secret in question an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the normal course of business we are from time to time a defendant in litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights anticompetitive behavior product liability breach of contract and employmentrelated claims in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

if any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations our business may suffer 

our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the us and the eu these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we may also be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification to be lawful and enforceable if we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements whether at all or in material part our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected further any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom’s bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom’s bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance program we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless 

or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation government enforcement actions and reputational risk 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate and where our products are sold these laws and regulations govern among other things

 we may not have been or we may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators in addition environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance requirements

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigation removal and remediation costs under certain federal and state laws is retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notifications from the us environmental protection agency other environmental agencies and third parties that conditions at a number of currently and formerlyowned or operated sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites we also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation andor remediation is necessary

while we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury property damage andor cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities

our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage hazardous material content and recycling 

the eu china and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal use of hazardous materials in products use of chemicals in manufacturing recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters these laws include but are not limited to the eu restriction of hazardous substances end of life vehicle and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the eu reach regulation and the china law on management methods for controlling pollution by electronic information products these laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes registration chemical testing labeling and other matters these laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale these laws could make the manufacture or sale of 

our products more expensive or impossible could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions and could result in liability for product recalls penalties or other claims

risks relating to our swiss jurisdiction of incorporation 

as a swiss corporation we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares 

as a swiss corporation our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements in addition our articles of association allow us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors but this authorization is limited to i authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years which authorization period ends on march 14 2020 approved by our shareholders at our march 14 2018 annual general meeting of shareholders and ii conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation dividends andor voting moreover under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convene a meeting of shareholders which would delay the timing to execute such actions such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management while we do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors

we might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

we anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes in order to make the distributions on our shares to shareholders free of swiss withholding tax various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital or that swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors

currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

under swiss law the registered share capital in our unconsolidated swiss statutory financial statements is required to be denominated in swiss francs although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in us dollars shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital if the us dollar were to increase in value relative to the swiss franc the us dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without swiss withholding tax will decrease

we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares 

the swiss code of obligations regulates a corporation’s ability to hold or repurchase its own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares 

beyond the statutory limit of 10 however only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation additionally various corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to repurchase our shares our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors

registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings 

our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by swiss law for swiss companies like us that issue registered shares as opposed to bearer shares this provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights holders of our shares must be registered in our share register aktienbuch as shareholders with voting rights only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders’ meetings but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends distributions preemptive rights advance subscription rights and liquidation proceeds the board of directors may in its discretion refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements in our articles of association additionally various proposals in switzerland for corporate law changes if passed in the future may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and banks such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors

certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable 

our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered “antitakeover” provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors under these provisions among others

 these provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital in either case representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in case of issuances from authorized capital until march 14 2020 unless reauthorized by shareholders for a subsequent twoyear period without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders’ preemptive rights or advance subscription rights for the purpose of the defense of an actual threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid in relation to which the board of directors upon consultation with an independent financial advisor has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders we note that swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital in addition the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which our shares are listed requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power with limited exceptions

global legislative and regulatory actions and proposals could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

various legislative and regulatory proposals have been directed at multinational companies with operations in lowertax jurisdictions there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives such as



 if these proposals are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business they could among other things cause double taxation increase audit risk and materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us

legislation in the us could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to us companies that have moved to lowertax jurisdictions

we expect the us congress to continue to consider implementation andor expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad we cannot predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals therefore we cannot provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us in addition we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to us federal or state governments or the willingness of our nongovernmental customers to do business with us as a result of these uncertainties we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us

swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

as we are organized under the laws of switzerland it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us and switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws would not be allowed in swiss courts as they are contrary to switzerland’s public policy

swiss law differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers thus holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax in addition we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims at any given time in the normal course of business we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions if infringement of a third party’s patent were to be determined against us we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products if a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our consolidated balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge which could be significant in amount

management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

we are a global industrial technology leader creating a safer sustainable productive and connected future our broad range of connectivity and sensor solutions proven in the harshest environments enable advancements in transportation industrial applications medical technology energy data communications and the home

fiscal 2019 included the following

 

​ 

outlook 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we expect our net sales to be between 30 billion and 32 billion as compared to 335 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we expect our net sales to be between 127 billion and 133 billion in fiscal 2020 as compared to 134 billion in fiscal 2019 these decreases are primarily due to sales declines in the communications solutions and transportation solutions segments additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2019 and for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 is as follows

 

we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of 093 to 099 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in fiscal 2020 we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of 421 to 461 per share 

the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2019 reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately 62 million and 003 per share respectively the outlook for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately 229 million and 011 per share respectively 

the above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels

we are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve we continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions additionally we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs see further discussion in “liquidity and capital resources” 

swiss parliament approved the federal act on tax reform and ahv financing “swiss tax reform” in september 2018 and it was approved by public vote in may 2019 certain measures became effective in fiscal 2019 and accordingly are reflected on our consolidated financial statements 

in october 2019 the canton of schaffhausen enacted swiss tax reform into law we are currently assessing the impacts of the cantonal implementation including reductions in tax rates we expect to recognize approximately 350 million of income tax expense related to the writedown of certain deferred tax assets to the lower tax rates in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 the period of enactment this income tax charge is not reflected in the above outlook however our outlook does reflect an expected increase of approximately 400 basis points in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 as a result of other provisions of swiss tax reform see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding swiss tax reform

 the following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by segment

 net sales decreased 540 million or 39 in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 the decrease in net sales resulted from the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 30 due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies and organic net sales declines 17 partially offset by sales contributions from acquisitions of 08 price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by 108 million in fiscal 2019

see further discussion of net sales below under “segment results”

net sales by geographic region our business operates in three geographic regions—emea asia–pacific and the americas—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into us dollars at the end of each fiscal period we sell our products into approximately 150 countries and approximately 60 of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar in fiscal 2019 the percentage of net sales in fiscal 2019 by major currencies invoiced was as follows

restructuring and other charges net we are committed to continuous productivity improvements and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint migrate facilities to lowercost regions reduce fixed costs and eliminate excess capacity these initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry improve our operating leverage and position us for future growth 

during fiscal 2019 we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments during fiscal 2018 we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the industrial solutions and transportation solutions segments in connection with these initiatives we incurred net restructuring charges of 255 million and 140 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately 220 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2021 cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses 

in response to market weakness in fiscal 2019 we initiated incremental restructuring actions primarily consisting of employee severance to broaden the scope of our cost reduction initiatives and accelerate cost reduction and factory footprint consolidation activities we previously disclosed that we expected total restructuring charges to be approximately 375 million in fiscal 2019 we now expect certain of these actions to occur in fiscal 2020 or 2021 for fiscal 2020 we currently expect total restructuring charges to be approximately 200 million to 250 million and total spending which will be funded with cash from operations to be approximately 300 million

liquidity and capital resources 

our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets money markets or other sources of funding as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements we believe that cash generated from operations and to the extent necessary these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future including the payment of 350 million of floating rate senior notes due in fiscal 2020 the pending acquisition of first sensor and cash spending related to restructuring initiatives we may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program to acquire strategic businesses or product lines to pay dividends on our common shares or to reduce our outstanding debt the cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions we will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions

as of fiscal year end 2019 our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world under current applicable laws substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to tyco electronics group sa “tegsa” our luxembourg subsidiary which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt and to te connectivity ltd our swiss parent company however the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased 153 million to 2454 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to 2301 million in fiscal 2018 the increase resulted primarily from higher collections of accounts receivable and fluctuations in cash collateral requirements under our crosscurrency swap contracts partially offset by a decrease in pretax income levels

the amount of income taxes paid net of refunds during fiscal 2019 and 2018 was 338 million and 393 million respectively we do not expect a significant change in our income tax payments as a result of swiss tax reform see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding swiss tax reform

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable leases and other obligations at fiscal year end 2019

 



 

legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including patent infringement claims product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in certain instances we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2020 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

at fiscal year end 2019 we had outstanding letters of credit letters of guarantee and surety bonds of 309 million

as discussed above in fiscal 2019 we sold our subcom business in connection with the sale we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the subcom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale these guarantees had a combined value of approximately 155 billion as of fiscal year end 2019 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025 however the majority are expected to expire by fiscal year end 2020 also under the terms of the definitive agreement we are required to issue up to 300 million of new performance guarantees subject to certain limitations for projects entered into by the subcom business following the sale for a period of up to three years at fiscal year end 2019 there were no such new performance guarantees outstanding we have contractual recourse against the subcom business if we are required to perform on any subcom guarantees however based on historical experience we do not anticipate having to perform see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the subcom business

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties management’s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period

​ 

revenue recognition 

we account for revenue in accordance with asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract such as a purchase order with a customer are satisfied generally this occurs with the transfer of control we transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers the customers accept and have legal title for the product and we have a right to payment for such product revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations we apply the practical expedient of asc 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as of fiscal year end 2019

we generally warrant that our products will conform to our or mutually agreed to specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time we limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product we do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations

although products are generally sold at fixed prices certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards such as sales rebates return allowances scrap allowances and other rights which are accounted for as variable consideration we estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of asc 606 in fiscal 2019

goodwill and other intangible assets 

intangible assets include both indeterminablelived residual goodwill and determinablelived identifiable intangible assets intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property consisting of patents trademarks and unpatented technology and customer relationships recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straightline basis evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinablelived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant

we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment a “component” if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management at fiscal year end 2019 we had five reporting units all of which contained goodwill there were two reporting units in both the transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments and one reporting unit in the communications solutions segment when changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values we review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test or more frequently based on changes in our structure

goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred in assessing the existence of a triggering event management relies on several reporting unitspecific factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis

when testing for goodwill impairment we perform a step i goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill may be impaired and a step ii goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment if any in the step ii goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill

fair value estimates used in the step i goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit the income approach has been supported by guideline analyses a market approach these approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates discount rates income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and determined that no impairment existed

income taxes 

in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of pretax operating income in various tax jurisdictions the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings

changes in tax laws and rates including swiss tax reform also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding swiss tax reform management is not aware of any other such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 income taxes  we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets

pension 

our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions the funded status of our plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date the projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels the fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds held for the sole benefit of participants which are invested by the trustee of the funds the benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors such as years of service and compensation

net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants or for inactive plans over the remaining life expectancy of participants

two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and employee turnover these assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations at fiscal year end 2019 a 25basispoint decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by 150 million a 25basispoint increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by 131 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a 50basispoint decrease or increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets would have increased or decreased respectively our fiscal 2019 pension expense by 11 million

at fiscal year end 2019 the longterm target asset allocation in our us plans’ master trust is 5 returnseeking assets and 95 liabilityhedging assets asset reallocation to meet that target is occurring over a multiyear period based on the funded status we expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 115 based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2019 our target asset allocation is 67 returnseeking and 33 liabilityhedging

nongaap financial measure 

organic net sales growth 

we present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with gaap organic net sales growth represents net sales growth the most comparable gaap financial measure excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months if any organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management’s control such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company such as acquisition and divestiture activity

organic net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance also management uses organic net sales growth together with gaap financial measures in its decisionmaking processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company it is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations the tables presented in “results of operations” and “segment results” provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with gaap

organic net sales growth is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with gaap this nongaap financial measure may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures reported by other companies the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results this limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth to better understand the amounts character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts

forwardlooking information 

certain statements in this annual report are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the us private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management forwardlooking statements include among others the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations business strategies financing plans competitive position potential growth opportunities potential operating performance improvements acquisitions divestitures the effects of competition and the effects of future legislation or regulations forwardlooking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as the words “believe” “expect” “plan” “intend” “anticipate” “estimate” “predict” “potential” “continue” “may” “should” or the negative of these terms or similar expressions

forwardlooking statements involve risks uncertainties and assumptions actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements investors should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements we do not have any intention or obligation to update forwardlooking statements after we file this report except as required by law

the following and other risks which are described in greater detail in “part i item 1a risk factors” as well as other risks described in this annual report could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward   looking statements 



 

there may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency movements on outstanding debt and nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks

we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an aa2 credit rating there is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty

foreign currency exposures 

as part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we utilize crosscurrency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions in addition we utilize crosscurrency swap contracts to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2019 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 282 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2018 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 101 million such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the losses or gains on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions

interest rate and investment exposures 

we issue debt as needed to fund our operations and capital requirements such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure to manage the interest rate exposure we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt we may use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt we also utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities

based on our floating rate debt balances at fiscal year end 2019 and 2018 a 50basispoint increase in the levels of the us dollar interest rates with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an immaterial increase in interest expense in both fiscal 2019 and 2018

​ 

commodity exposures 

our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges we continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period at fiscal year end 2019 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net gain position of 1 million and had a notional value of 316 million at fiscal year end 2018 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net loss position of 34 million and had a notional value of 401 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the fiscal year end 2019 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 32 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the fiscal year end 2018 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 37 million

customers 

as an industry leader we have established close working relationships with many of our customers these relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions by working with our customers in developing new products and technologies we believe we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about nextgeneration technology across our products 

our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support we believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers 

we manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries and our relationships with them typically date back many years we believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance additionally we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors 

no single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 

sales and distribution 

we maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate our net sales by geographic region 1 as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows 



1 net sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale 

we sell our products into approximately 140 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers in fiscal 2018 our direct sales represented approximately 80 of total net sales we also sell our products indirectly via thirdparty distributors 

we maintain distribution centers around the world products are generally delivered to the distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer in some instances however products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer our global coverage positions us near our customers locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs we contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products globally via road rail sea and air we believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile 

seasonality and backlog 

we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business overall the third and fourth fiscal quarters are typically the strongest quarters of our fiscal year whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets 

certain of our end markets experience some seasonality our sales into the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production and seasonal declines in european production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter also our sales into the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases 

customer orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business and market conditions backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods backlog by reportable segment was as follows 



we expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2018 will be filled during fiscal 2019 

competition 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers competition is generally based on breadth of product offering product innovation price quality delivery and service our markets have generally been growing but with downward pressure on prices 

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products the principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding precious metals such as gold and silver for plating and other metals such as copper aluminum brass and steel for manufacturing cable contacts and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers the prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand 

intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including patents and patent applications as available in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical optical and electronic products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks 

while we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents 

management team and employees 

we believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership our chief executive officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience they are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry 

our strong employee base along with their commitment to uncompromising values provides the foundation of our companys success we continue to emphasize employee development and training and we embrace diversity and inclusion 

we have employees located throughout the world as of fiscal year end 2018 we employed approximately 80000 people worldwide of whom 30000 were in the emea region 25000 were in the asia–pacific region and 25000 were in the americas region of our total employees approximately 51000 were employed in manufacturing 

government regulation and supervision 

the import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events we have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction 

environmental 

our operations are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment greenhouse gas emissions hazardous materials in products and chemical usage we are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment we maintain a global environmental health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards staff dedicated to environmental health and safety issues periodic compliance auditing training and other measures we also have a program for compliance with the european union eu restriction of hazardous substances and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the china restriction of hazardous substances law the eu registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach regulation and similar laws 

compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future for example laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection management and reporting and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products we also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations based upon our experience available information and applicable laws as of fiscal year end 2018 we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of 15 million to 42 million and we accrued 17 million as the probable loss which was the best estimate within this range we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2019 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions

 item 1a risk factors 

  investors should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities these risks are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations financial condition and liquidity 

risks relating to the macroeconomic environment and our global presence 

  conditions in global or regional economies capital and money markets and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit end demand from consumer and industrial markets and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults any of these economic factors could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow and ability to obtain financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full further our vendors may experience similar problems which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels if regional or global economic conditions deteriorate our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected also deterioration in economic conditions could trigger the recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other longlived assets impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position 

  foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in united states us dollars however a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue approximately 60 of our net sales for fiscal 2018 were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect nonus dollar revenue to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net sales we have elected not to hedge this foreign currency exposure therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro or asian currencies our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease 

we manage certain cash intercompany and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts in addition to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to these contracts our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful 

  we could suffer significant business interruptions 

our operations and those of our suppliers and customers and the supply chains that support their operations may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis typhoons or floods or other disasters such as fires explosions acts of terrorism or war disease or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

  we could be adversely affected by a decline in the market value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets 

concerns about deterioration in the global economy together with concerns about credit inflation or deflation have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities including fixed income and equity securities which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans investment portfolios in addition the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved a decrease in the value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding 

the global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital as a result we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures the extent of any impact will depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions 

  we are subject to global risks of political economic and military instability 

our workforce manufacturing research administrative and sales facilities markets customers and suppliers are located throughout the world as a result we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including 

• changes in global trade policies including sanctions tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes • regulations related to customs and importexport matters • variations in lengths of payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable • tax law and regulatory changes in the us and eu among other jurisdictions including tax law and regulatory changes that may be effected as a result of tax policy recommendations from quasigovernmental organizations such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd examinations by taxing authorities variations in tax laws from country to country changes to the terms of income tax treaties and difficulties in the taxefficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions • employment regulations and local labor conditions including increases in employment costs particularly in lowcost regions in which we currently operate • difficulties protecting intellectual property • instability in economic or political conditions including sovereign debt levels eurozone uncertainty inflation recession actual or anticipated military or political conflicts and any impact as a result of the expected exit of the united kingdom from the eu and • the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements we have sizeable operations in china including 16 manufacturing sites in addition approximately 20 of our net sales in fiscal 2018 were made to customers in china economic conditions in china have been and may continue to be volatile and uncertain in addition the legal and regulatory system in china is still developing and subject to change accordingly our operations and transactions with 

customers in china could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions changes to the regulatory environment or interpretation of chinese law 

in addition any downgrade by rating agencies of longterm us sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions which could negatively affect our business financial condition and liquidity 

  changes in us federal tax laws could result in adverse consequences to us persons treated as owning 10 or more of our shares 

although we are a swiss corporation recent us tax law changes have expanded application of certain ownership attribution rules and cause certain of our nonus subsidiaries to be treated as controlled foreign corporations cfcs for us federal income tax purposes a us person that is treated for us federal income tax purposes as owning directly indirectly or constructively 10 or more of our shares may be required to annually report and include in its us taxable income its pro rata share of certain types of income earned by our subsidiaries that are treated as cfcs whether or not we make any distributions to such us shareholder a us person that owns 10 or more of our shares should consult a tax adviser regarding the potential implications to it of these changes in us federal income tax law the risk of us federal income tax reporting and compliance obligations with respect to our subsidiaries that now are treated as cfcs may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us and others from investing in us which could impact the demand for and value of our shares 

risks relating to the industry in which we operate 

  we are dependent on the automotive and other industries 

we are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products and our operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets periodic downturns in our customers industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

approximately 44 of our net sales for fiscal 2018 were to customers in the automotive industry the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers additionally the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions as a supplier of automotive electronics products our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic and credit conditions and changes in the operations products business models partsourcing requirements financial condition and market share of automotive manufacturers as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers 

during fiscal 2018 approximately 14 of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market 9 of our net sales were to customers in the commercial transportation market and 8 of our net sales were to customers in the aerospace defense oil and gas end market demand for industrial equipment is dependent upon economic conditions including customer investment in factory automation intelligent buildings and process control systems as well as market conditions in the medical rail transportation solar and lighting and other major industrial markets we serve the commercial transportation industry can experience variability in demand depending on the economic environment and market conditions in the heavy truck construction agriculture and recreational vehicle markets the aerospace and defense industry has undergone significant fluctuations in demand depending on worldwide economic and political conditions demand in the oil and gas market is impacted by oil price volatility 

  we encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry 

we operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology our ability to participate in emerging markets and customers expectations relating to socially responsible operations the competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large diversified manufacturers to small highly specialized manufacturers the electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities a number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products we cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue 

substantially all markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences which are rapid in certain end markets our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design develop introduce and sell new and innovative products to modify existing products and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change there are numerous risks inherent in these processes including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands 

  like other suppliers to the electronics industry we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices 

we have historically experienced and we expect to continue to experience continuing pressure to lower our prices in recent years we have experienced price erosion averaging from 1 to 2 each year to maintain our margins we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts we cannot provide assurance that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate 

many of the industries to which we sell our products as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials have become more concentrated in recent years including the automotive data and devices and aerospace and defense industries consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us in addition as our customers buy in larger volumes their volume buying power has increased enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing these trends may adversely affect the margins on our products particularly for commodity components 

  the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short 

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle as a result the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment if we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not 

able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

risks relating to our operations 

  our results are sensitive to raw material availability quality and cost 

we are a large buyer of resins chemicals additives and metals including copper gold silver aluminum brass steel and zinc many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers in addition the price of many of these raw materials including gold and copper continues to fluctuate if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are significant price increases for these raw materials it could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers our margins may decline materially affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices the success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials we could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate 

in accordance with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use tin tantalum tungsten or gold conflict minerals or 3tg mined from the democratic republic of the congo drc and adjoining countries together with the drc the covered countries in their products these requirements could affect the sourcing pricing and availability of 3tg used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who can demonstrate that they do not source any 3tg from the covered countries and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain nonconflict 3tg in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures 

  we may use components and products manufactured by third parties 

we may rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we may rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if these third parties fail to deliver quality products parts and components on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

  our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain management and executive management employees 

our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our management and executive management employees and hire new management and executive management employees to replace succeed or add to members of our management team our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for management talent is intense and any difficulties we may have to retain or hire members of mangagement to achieve our objectives may have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise confidential information and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise information belonging to us our employees customers and suppliers and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation in the normal course of business we rely on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally we collect and store certain data including proprietary business information and customer and employee data and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our cybersecurity measures including employee and thirdparty training monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems which are continuously reviewed and upgraded to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in operations and damage to our reputation which could materially adversely affect our business while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure to date none of these threats have had a material impact on our business or operations 

  covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our fiveyear unsecured senior revolving credit facility credit facility contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens our outstanding notes indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate merge and sell assets 

although none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations our continued ability to meet the credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant a breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our credit facility if the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder 

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

  the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors including 

• our quarterly or annual earnings • quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide or changes thereto • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results • volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global and regional economic conditions and investors concerns about potential risks to future economic growth • changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates • changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles • tax legislative and regulatory actions and proposals in switzerland the us and other jurisdictions • announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions and • the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business risks relating to strategic transactions 

  future acquisitions may not be successful 

we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings we cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future we also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity 

if we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements this acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to make an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares 

  divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered 

risks relating to intellectual property litigation and regulations 

  our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology 

the electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights within this industry companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights depending on the importance of the technology product patent trademark or trade secret in question an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the normal course of business we are from time to time a defendant in litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights anticompetitive behavior product liability breach of contract and employmentrelated claims in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  if any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations our business may suffer 

our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the us and the eu these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we may also be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable if we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements whether at all or in material part our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected further any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdoms bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdoms bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance program we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations 

of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation government enforcement actions and reputational risk 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate and where our products are sold these laws and regulations govern among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials • emissions or discharges of substances into the environment • investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites • greenhouse gas emissions • product hazardous material content and • the health and safety of our employees we may not have been or we may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators in addition environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance requirements 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigation removal and remediation costs under certain federal and state laws is retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notifications from the us environmental protection agency other environmental agencies and third parties that conditions at a number of currently and formerlyowned or operated sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites we also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation andor remediation is necessary 

while we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury property damage andor cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

  our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage hazardous material content and recycling 

the eu china and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal use of hazardous materials in products use of chemicals in manufacturing recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters these laws include but are not limited to the eu 

restriction of hazardous substances end of life vehicle and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the eu reach regulation and the china law on management methods for controlling pollution by electronic information products these laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes registration chemical testing labeling and other matters these laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale these laws could make the manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions and could result in liability for product recalls penalties or other claims 

risks relating to our swiss jurisdiction of incorporation 

  as a swiss corporation we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares 

as a swiss corporation our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements in addition our articles of association allow us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors but this authorization is limited to i authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years which authorization period ends on march 14 2020 approved by our shareholders at our march 14 2018 annual general meeting of shareholders and ii conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation dividends andor voting moreover under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convene a meeting of shareholders which would delay the timing to execute such actions such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management while we do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors 

  we might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

in order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of swiss withholding tax we anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital or that swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free 

from swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

under swiss law the registered share capital in our unconsolidated swiss statutory financial statements is required to be denominated in swiss francs although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in us dollars shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital if the us dollar were to increase in value relative to the swiss franc the us dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without swiss withholding tax will decrease 

  we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares 

the swiss code of obligations regulates a corporations ability to hold or repurchase its own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation additionally various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to repurchase our shares our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings 

our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by swiss law for swiss companies like us that issue registered shares as opposed to bearer shares this provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights holders of our shares must be registered in our share register aktienbuch as shareholders with voting rights only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders meetings but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends distributions preemptive rights advance subscription rights and liquidation proceeds the board of directors may in its discretion refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements in our articles of association additionally various proposals in switzerland for corporate law changes if passed in the future may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and banks such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable 

our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered antitakeover provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors under these provisions among others 

• shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent and • restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15 or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors these provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital in either case representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in case of issuances from authorized capital until march 14 2020 unless reauthorized by shareholders for a subsequent twoyear period without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders preemptive rights or advance subscription rights for the purpose of the defense of an actual threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid in relation to which the board of directors upon consultation with an independent financial advisor has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders we note that swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital in addition the new york stock exchange nyse on which our shares are listed requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power with limited exceptions 

  legislative and regulatory actions and proposals in switzerland the us and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

various legislative and regulatory proposals have been directed at multinational companies with operations in lowertax jurisdictions there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives such as 

• the oecds initiative to develop agreedupon best practices to prevent base erosion and profit shifting which contemplate changes to numerous longstanding tax principles related to the distribution of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions • corporate tax reform in switzerland which is proposed in response to oecd and eu concerns • eu and other country efforts to adopt certain oecd proposals and modified oecd proposals including the antitax avoidance directive state aid cases and various transparency proposals and • tax policy in the us such as federal tax reform and revisions to the model income tax treaty if these proposals are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business they could among other things cause double taxation increase audit risk and materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us 

  legislation in the us could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to us companies that have moved to lowertax jurisdictions 

we expect the us congress to continue to consider implementation andor expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad we cannot predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals therefore we cannot provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us in addition we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to us federal or state governments or the willingness of our nongovernmental customers to do business with us as a result of these uncertainties we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us 

  swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

as we are organized under the laws of switzerland it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us and switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws would not be allowed in swiss courts as they are contrary to switzerlands public policy 

swiss law differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers thus holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 







 item 2 properties 

our principal executive office is located in schaffhausen switzerland as of fiscal year end 2018 we owned approximately 20 million square feet and leased approximately 9 million square feet of manufacturing warehousing and office space we believe our facilities are suitable for the conduct of our business and adequate for our current needs 

we manufacture our products in approximately 25 countries worldwide our manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of our manufacturing processes including our primary processes of stamping plating molding extrusion beaming and assembly we consider the productive capacity of our manufacturing facilities sufficient as of fiscal year end 2018 our principal centers of manufacturing output by segment and geographic region were as follows 






 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax in addition we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims at any given time in the normal course of business we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions if infringement of a third partys patent were to be determined against us we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products if a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our consolidated balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge which could be significant in amount 

management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 one of our manufacturing sites in china was found to have failed to complete the environmental impact assessment inspection for certain of its production lines and assets within the mandatory timeframe as defined within applicable environmental regulation at the request of the shanghai xuhui environmental protection bureau we are taking remedial action to cure the deficiencies and we expect to pay an administrative penalty in the amount of 700000 chinese renminbi approximately 01 million using an exchange rate of 015 per renminbi we do not anticipate that any monetary sanctions or remedial actions we take will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

overview 

we are a global technology and manufacturing leader creating a safer sustainable productive and connected future for more than 75 years our connectivity and sensor solutions proven in the harshest environments have enabled advancements in transportation industrial applications medical technology energy data communications and the home 

fiscal 2018 highlights included the following 

• our fiscal 2018 net sales increased 148 over fiscal 2017 levels due to growth in all segments on an organic basis our net sales increased 92 in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 • our net sales by segment were as follows • transportation solutions —our net sales increased 178 as a result of increased sales in all end markets also our net sales in the automotive end market benefited from sales contributions from a recent acquisition • industrial solutions —our net sales increased 100 due to increased sales in the industrial equipment end market and to a lesser degree the aerospace defense oil and gas and the energy end markets • communications solutions —our net sales increased 124 due to sales increases in the appliances and the data and devices end markets • during fiscal 2018 our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of 176 per share payable in four equal quarterly installments of 044 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 • net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 2301 million in fiscal 2018 outlook 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we expect our net sales to be between 333 billion and 343 billion as compared to 334 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 with sales increases in the industrial solutions and communications solutions segments additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2018 is as follows 

• transportation solutions —we expect our net sales increase in the sensors end market to be offset by sales declines in the automotive end market our net sales in the automotive end market are 24 

expected to benefit from content gains however this growth will be more than offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates we expect global automotive production to decline approximately 2 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 

• industrial solutions —we expect our net sales growth to be driven primarily by increased sales in the aerospace defense oil and gas and the industrial equipment end markets • communications solutions —we expect net sales growth primarily as a result of increased sales in the data and devices end market in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of 109 to 113 per share this outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately 75 million and 004 per share respectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2018 

we expect our net sales to be between 139 billion and 143 billion in fiscal 2019 as compared to 140 billion in fiscal 2018 with moderate growth in all segments additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 is as follows 

• transportation solutions —we expect our net sales increases in the sensors end market to be largely offset by sales declines in the commercial transportation end market fiscal 2019 global automotive production is expected to be consistent with fiscal 2018 levels • industrial solutions —we expect our net sales to increase in the industrial equipment end market due primarily to continued growth in medical applications and a recent acquisition • communications solutions —we expect net sales growth due primarily to sales increases in the data and devices end market we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of 520 to 540 per share in fiscal 2019 this outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately 400 million and 016 per share respectively in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 

the above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels 

we are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve we continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions additionally we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources

liquidity and capital resources 

our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets money markets or other sources of funding as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements we believe that cash generated from operations and to the extent necessary these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future including the payment of 325 million of 2375 senior notes and 250 million of 235 senior notes due in fiscal 2019 we may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program to acquire strategic businesses or product lines to pay dividends on our common shares or to reduce our outstanding debt the cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions we will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions 

as of fiscal year end 2018 our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world under current applicable laws substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to tyco electronics group sa tegsa our luxembourg subsidiary which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt and to te connectivity ltd our swiss parent company however the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense we provide for tax liabilities on the consolidated financial statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations as of fiscal year end 2018 we had approximately 116 billion of cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits principally in our subsidiaries that we have the ability to distribute to tegsa and te connectivity ltd but we consider to be permanently reinvested we estimate that up to 09 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the consolidated financial statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations including investing and financing activities 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased 28 million to 2301 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to 2273 million in fiscal 2017 the increase resulted primarily from higher pretax income levels substantially offset by the impact of higher working capital to support increased business levels and increased incentive compensation payments 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased 340 million to 2273 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to 1933 million in fiscal 2016 the increase resulted primarily from higher pretax income levels an increase in accrued and other current liabilities related primarily to incentive compensation and a decrease in net payments related to preseparation tax matters partially offset by the impact of increased sales on accounts receivable levels 

the amount of income taxes paid net of refunds during fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 was 393 million 323 million and 806 million respectively in fiscal 2017 and 2016 these amounts included refunds of 23 million and payments of 471 million respectively related to preseparation tax matters during fiscal 2016 we received net reimbursements of 321 million from tyco international and covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for preseparation tax matters we do not expect a significant change in our income tax payments as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act

commitments and contingencies 

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable leases and other obligations at fiscal year end 2018 



1 debt represents principal payments see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt 2 interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swap contracts 3 purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services 

4 the above table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of 566 million and related accrued interest and penalties of 60 million the timing of which is uncertain see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits interest and penalties 5 the above table does not reflect pension obligations to certain employees and former employees we are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans however we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type including timing interest rate charges investment performance and amounts of benefit payments we expect to contribute 47 million to pension plans in fiscal 2019 before consideration of any voluntary contributions see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments 6 other longterm liabilities of 487 million are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items 

legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including patent infringement claims product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in certain instances we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2019 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

at fiscal year end 2018 we had outstanding letters of credit letters of guarantee and surety bonds of 275 million 

as discussed above in september 2018 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our subcom business following the divestiture we will continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the subcom business existing projects these existing guarantees have a combined value of approximately 17 billion and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025 however the majority are expected to expire within two years also under the terms of the definitive agreement we are required to issue up to 300 million of new performance guarantees subject to certain limitations for projects entered into by the subcom business following the sale for a period of up to three years we have contractual recourse against the subcom business if we are required to perform on these guarantees however based on historical experience we do not anticipate having to 

perform see notes 4 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the subcom business 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

revenue recognition 

our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 605 revenue recognition  our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer this generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies a reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and also is recorded as a reduction of sales 

contract revenues for construction related projects which are generated in the subcom business which is reported in discontinued operations are recorded primarily using the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete percentageofcompletion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable in addition provisions for credit losses related to unbilled receivables on construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable 

see notes 4 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the subcom business see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  in fiscal 2019 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

intangible assets include both indeterminablelived residual goodwill and determinablelived identifiable intangible assets intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property consisting of patents trademarks and unpatented technology and customer relationships recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straightline basis evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinablelived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant 

we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment a component if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management at fiscal year end 2018 we had five reporting units all of which contained goodwill there were two reporting units in both the transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments and one reporting unit in the communications solutions segment when changes occur in the 

composition of one or more reporting units goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values we review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test or more frequently based on changes in our structure 

goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred in assessing the existence of a triggering event management relies on a number of reporting unitspecific factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis 

when testing for goodwill impairment we perform a step i goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill may be impaired and a step ii goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment if any in the step ii goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 

fair value estimates used in the step i goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit the income approach has been supported by guideline analyses a market approach these approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates discount rates income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and determined that no impairment existed 

income taxes 

in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of pretax operating income in various tax jurisdictions the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate 

jurisdictions any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 income taxes  we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

pension liabilities 

our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions the funded status of our plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date the projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels the fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds held for the sole benefit of participants which are invested by the trustee of the funds the benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors such as years of service and compensation 

net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants 

two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and employee turnover these assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations at fiscal year end 2018 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by 124 million a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by 111 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets would have increased or decreased respectively our fiscal 2018 pension expense by 12 million 

at fiscal year end 2018 the longterm target asset allocation in our us plans master trust is 10 returnseeking assets and 90 liabilityhedging assets asset reallocation to meet that target is occurring over a multiyear period based on the funded status we expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 105 based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2018 our target asset allocation is 45 returnseeking and 55 liabilityhedging 

accounting pronouncements

nongaap financial measure 

organic net sales growth 

we present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with gaap organic net sales growth represents net sales growth the most comparable gaap financial measure excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months if any organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under managements control such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company such as acquisition and divestiture activity 

organic net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance also management uses organic net sales growth together with gaap financial measures in its decisionmaking processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company it is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations the tables presented in results of operations and segment results provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with gaap 

organic net sales growth is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with gaap this nongaap financial measure may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures reported by other companies the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results this limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth in order to better understand the amounts character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts 

forwardlooking information 

certain statements in this annual report are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the us private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management forwardlooking statements include among others the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations business strategies financing plans competitive position potential growth opportunities potential operating performance improvements acquisitions divestitures the effects of competition and the effects of future legislation or regulations forwardlooking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as the words believe expect plan intend anticipate estimate predict potential continue may should or the negative of these terms or similar expressions 

forwardlooking statements involve risks uncertainties and assumptions actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements investors should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements we do not have any intention or obligation to update forwardlooking statements after we file this report except as required by law 

the following and other risks which are described in greater detail in part i item 1a risk factors as well as other risks described in this annual report could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements 

• conditions in the global or regional economies and global capital markets and cyclical industry conditions • conditions affecting demand for products in the industries we serve particularly the automotive industry • competition and pricing pressure • market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations and product life cycles • raw material availability quality and cost • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates • financial condition and consolidation of customers and vendors • reliance on thirdparty suppliers • risks associated with current and future acquisitions and divestitures • global risks of business interruptions such as natural disasters and political economic and military instability • risks associated with security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure • risks related to compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations • our ability to protect our intellectual property rights • risks of litigation • our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by our debt instruments • the possible effects on us of various nonus and us legislative proposals and other initiatives that if adopted could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate and negatively impact our us government contracts business • various risks associated with being a swiss corporation • the impact of fluctuations in the market price of our shares and • the impact of certain provisions of our articles of association on unsolicited takeover proposals there may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency movements on outstanding debt and nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks 

we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an aa2 credit rating there is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty 

foreign currency exposures 

as part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we utilize crosscurrency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2018 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 101 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2017 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 122 million such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the losses or gains on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions 

interest rate and investment exposures 

we issue debt as needed to fund our operations and capital requirements such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure to manage the interest rate exposure we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixedrate debt into variablerate debt we may use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixedrate debt we also utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities 

based on our floating rate debt balances at fiscal year end 2018 and 2017 a 50 basis point increase in the levels of the us dollar interest rates with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an immaterial increase in interest expense in both fiscal 2018 and 2017 

commodity exposures 

our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges we continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period at fiscal year end 2018 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net loss position of 34 million and had a notional value of 401 million at fiscal year end 2017 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net gain position of 20 million and had a notional value of 314 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the fiscal year end 2018 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 37 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a 

troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the fiscal year end 2017 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 33 million

as an industry leader we have established close working relationships with many of our customers these relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions by working with our customers in developing new products and technologies we believe we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about nextgeneration technology across our products 

our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support we believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers 

we manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries and our relationships with them typically date back many years we believe that this diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance additionally we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors 

no single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2017 2016 or 2015 

sales and distribution 

we maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate our net sales by geographic region 1 as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows 



1 net sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale 2 the americas region includes our subsea communications business 

see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional geographic information relating to our business 

we sell our products into approximately 150 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers we also sell our products indirectly via thirdparty distributors in fiscal 2017 our direct sales represented approximately 80 of total net sales 

we maintain distribution centers around the world our global coverage positions us near our customers locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs we believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile 

products are generally delivered to distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer in some instances however products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer we contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products via road rail sea and air 

seasonality and backlog 

we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business overall the third and fourth fiscal quarters are typically the strongest quarters of our fiscal year whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets 

certain of our end markets experience some seasonality our sales into the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production and seasonal declines in european production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter also our sales into the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases 

customer orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business conditions and cancellation of unfilled orders prior to shipment of goods backlog by reportable segment was as follows 



1 includes our subsea communications business backlog of 739 million and 1047 million at fiscal year end 2017 and 2016 respectively subsea communications is a projectbased business its backlog may fluctuate as a result of program timing 

we expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2017 will be filled during fiscal 2018 

competition 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers competition is generally based on breadth of product offering product innovation price quality delivery and service our markets have generally been growing but with downward pressure on prices 

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products the principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding precious metals such as gold and silver for plating and other metals such as copper aluminum brass and steel for manufacturing cable contacts and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers the prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas where we may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition 

our research and development expense was as follows 



our capital spending and investment in product and process engineering and development enable us to consistently provide innovative highquality products with efficient manufacturing methods in fiscal 2017 we derived approximately 20 of our net sales from new products including product extensions introduced within the previous three fiscal years 

intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including patents and patent applications as available in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical optical and electronic products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks 

while we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents

management team and employees 

we believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership our chief executive officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience they are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry 

our strong employee base along with their commitment to uncompromising values provides the foundation of our companys success we continue to emphasize employee development and training and we embrace diversity and inclusion 

we have employees located throughout the world as of fiscal year end 2017 we employed approximately 78000 people worldwide of whom 24000 were in the americas region 29000 were in the emea region and 25000 were in the asia–pacific region of our total employees approximately 49000 were employed in manufacturing 

government regulation and supervision 

the import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events we have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction 

environmental 

our operations are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment greenhouse gas emissions hazardous materials in products and chemical usage we are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment we maintain a global environmental health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards staff dedicated to environmental health and safety issues periodic compliance auditing training and other measures we also have a program for compliance with the european union eu restriction of hazardous substances and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the china restriction of hazardous substances law the eu registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach regulation and similar laws 

compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future for example laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection management and reporting and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products we also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations based upon our experience available information and applicable laws as of fiscal year end 2017 we concluded that it was probable that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the range of 15 million to 43 million and that the best estimate within this range was 19 million we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions

 item 1a risk factors 

  investors should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities these risks are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations financial condition and liquidity 

risks relating to the macroeconomic environment and our global presence 

  conditions in global or regional economies capital and money markets and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit end demand from consumer and industrial markets and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults any of these economic factors could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow and ability to obtain financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or 

cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full further our vendors may experience similar problems which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels if regional or global economic conditions deteriorate our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected also deterioration in economic conditions could trigger the recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other longlived assets impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position 

  foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states us and changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue approximately 55 of our net sales for fiscal 2017 were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect nonus dollar revenue to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net revenue we have elected not to hedge this foreign currency exposure therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro or asian currencies our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease 

we manage certain cash intercompany and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts in addition to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to these contracts our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful 

  we could suffer significant business interruptions 

our operations and those of our suppliers and customers and the supply chains that support their operations may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis typhoons or floods or other disasters such as fires explosions acts of terrorism or war disease or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

  we could be adversely affected by a decline in the market value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets 

concerns about deterioration in the global economy together with concerns about credit inflation or deflation have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities including fixed income and equity securities which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans investment portfolios in addition the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved a decrease in the value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding 

the global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital as a result we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital 

expenditures the extent of any impact will depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions 

  we are subject to global risks of political economic and military instability 

our workforce manufacturing research administrative and sales facilities markets customers and suppliers are located throughout the world as a result we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including 

• tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes • regulations related to customs and importexport matters • variations in lengths of payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable • tax law and regulatory changes in the us and eu among other jurisdictions including tax law and regulatory changes that may be effected as a result of tax policy recommendations from quasigovernmental organizations such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd examinations by taxing authorities variations in tax laws from country to country changes to the terms of income tax treaties and difficulties in the taxefficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions • employment regulations and local labor conditions including increases in employment costs particularly in lowcost regions in which we currently operate • difficulties protecting intellectual property • instability in economic or political conditions including sovereign debt levels eurozone uncertainty inflation recession actual or anticipated military or political conflicts and any impact as a result of the expected exit of the united kingdom from the eu and • the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements we have sizeable operations in china including 14 manufacturing sites in addition approximately 18 of our net sales in fiscal 2017 were made to customers in china economic conditions in china have been and may continue to be volatile and uncertain in addition the legal and regulatory system in china is still developing and subject to change accordingly our operations and transactions with customers in china could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions changes to the regulatory environment or interpretation of chinese law 

in addition any downgrade by rating agencies of longterm us sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions which could negatively affect our business financial condition and liquidity 

risks relating to the industry in which we operate 

  we are dependent on the automotive and other industries 

we are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products and our operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets periodic downturns in our customers industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

approximately 40 of our net sales for fiscal 2017 were to customers in the automotive industry the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers additionally the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions as a 

supplier of automotive electronics products our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic and credit conditions and changes in the operations products business models partsourcing requirements financial condition and market share of automotive manufacturers as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers 

during fiscal 2017 approximately 13 of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market 8 of our net sales were to customers in the aerospace defense oil and gas end market and 8 of our net sales were to customers in the commercial transportation market demand for industrial equipment is dependent upon economic conditions including customer investment in intelligent buildings factory automation and process control systems as well as market conditions in the medical rail transportation solar and lighting and other major industrial markets we serve the aerospace and defense industry has undergone significant fluctuations in demand depending on worldwide economic and political conditions demand in the oil and gas market is impacted by oil price volatility the commercial transportation industry can experience variability in demand depending on the economic environment and market conditions in the heavy truck construction agriculture and recreational vehicle markets 

  we encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry 

we operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology our ability to participate in emerging markets and customers expectations relating to socially responsible operations the competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large diversified manufacturers to small highly specialized manufacturers the electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities a number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products we cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue 

substantially all markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences which are rapid in certain end markets our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design develop introduce and sell new and innovative products to modify existing products and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change there are numerous risks inherent in these processes including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands 

  like other suppliers to the electronics industry we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices 

we have historically experienced and we expect to continue to experience continuing pressure to lower our prices in recent years we have experienced price erosion averaging from 1 to 2 each year to maintain our margins we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts we cannot provide assurance that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate 

many of the industries to which we sell our products as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials have become more concentrated in recent years including the automotive data and devices and aerospace and defense industries consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us in addition as our customers buy in larger volumes their volume buying power has increased enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing these trends may adversely affect the margins on our products particularly for commodity components 

  the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short 

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle as a result the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment if we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

risks relating to our operations 

  our results are sensitive to raw material availability quality and cost 

we are a large buyer of resins chemicals and additives and metals including copper gold silver aluminum brass steel and zinc many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers in addition the price of many of these raw materials including gold and copper continues to fluctuate if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are significant price increases for these raw materials it could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers our margins may decline materially affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices the success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials we could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate 

in accordance with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use tin tantalum tungsten or gold conflict minerals or 3tg mined from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries together with the drc the covered countries in their products these requirements could affect the sourcing pricing and availability of 3tg used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who can demonstrate that they do not source any 3tg from the covered countries and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain nonconflict 3tg in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures 

  we may use components and products manufactured by third parties 

we may rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we may rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if these third parties fail to deliver quality products parts and components on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

  our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain executive management employees and limitations affecting retention and hiring including swiss regulations could have a negative impact on our business and increase our expenses 

our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our executive management employees and hire new executive management employees to replace succeed or add to members of our executive management team our executive management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for executive talent is intense and we compete for these personnel with other companies that are regulated by the laws of jurisdictions that provide significantly greater flexibility than switzerland our jurisdiction of incorporation in compensation practices for executive management employees 

  security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise confidential information and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise information belonging to us our employees customers and suppliers and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation in the normal course of business we rely on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally we collect and store certain data including proprietary business information and customer and employee data and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our cybersecurity measures including employee and thirdparty training monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems which are continuously reviewed and upgraded to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cyber security threats our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in operations and damage to our reputation which could materially adversely affect our business while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure to date none of these threats have had a material impact on our business or operations 

  covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our fiveyear unsecured senior revolving credit facility credit facility contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens our outstanding notes indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate merge and sell assets 

although none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations our continued ability to meet the credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant a breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our credit facility if the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding 

under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder 

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

  the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors including 

• our quarterly or annual earnings • quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide or changes thereto • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results • volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global and regional economic conditions and investors concerns about potential risks to future economic growth • changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates • changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles • tax legislative and regulatory actions and proposals in switzerland the us and other jurisdictions • announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions and • the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business risks relating to strategic transactions 

  future acquisitions may not be successful 

we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings we cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future we also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity 

if we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements this acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to make an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares 

  divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered 

risks relating to intellectual property litigation and regulations 

  our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology 

the electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights within this industry companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights depending on the importance of the technology product patent trademark or trade secret in question an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the normal course of business we are from time to time a defendant in litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights anticompetitive behavior product liability breach of contract and employmentrelated claims in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  if any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations our business may suffer 

our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the us and the eu these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we may also be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable if we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements whether at all or in material part our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected further any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdoms bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdoms bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance program we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation government enforcement actions and reputational risk 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate and where our products are sold these laws and regulations govern among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials • emissions or discharges of substances into the environment • investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites • greenhouse gas emissions • product hazardous material content and • the health and safety of our employees we may not have been or we may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators in addition environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigation removal and remediation costs under certain federal and state laws is retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notifications from the us environmental protection agency other environmental agencies and third parties that conditions at a number of currently and formerlyowned or operated sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites we also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation andor remediation is necessary 

while we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our 

results of operations financial position and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury property damage andor cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

  our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage hazardous material content and recycling 

the eu china and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal use of hazardous materials in products use of chemicals in manufacturing recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters these laws include but are not limited to the eu restriction of hazardous substances end of life vehicle and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the eu reach regulation and the china law on management methods for controlling pollution by electronic information products these laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes registration chemical testing labeling and other matters these laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale these laws could make the manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions and could result in liability for product recalls penalties or other claims 

risks relating to our swiss jurisdiction of incorporation 

  as a swiss corporation we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares 

as a swiss corporation our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements in addition our articles of association allow us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors but this authorization is limited to i authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years which authorization period ends on march 2 2018 approved by our shareholders at our march 2 2016 annual meeting of shareholders and ii conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation dividends andor voting moreover under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convene a meeting of shareholders which would delay the timing to execute such actions such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management while we do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors 

  we might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

in order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of swiss withholding tax we anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital or that swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

under swiss law the registered share capital in our unconsolidated swiss statutory financial statements is required to be denominated in swiss francs since distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in us dollars shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital if the us dollar were to increase in value relative to the swiss franc the us dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without swiss withholding tax will decrease 

  we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares 

the swiss code of obligations regulates a corporations ability to hold or repurchase its own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation additionally various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to repurchase our shares our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings 

our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by swiss law for swiss companies like us that issue registered shares as opposed to bearer shares this provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights holders of our shares must be registered in our share register aktienbuch as shareholders with voting rights only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders meetings but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends distributions preemptive rights advance subscription rights and liquidation proceeds the board of directors may in its discretion refuse to 

register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements in our articles of association additionally various proposals in switzerland for corporate law changes if passed in the future may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and banks such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable 

our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered antitakeover provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors under these provisions among others 

• shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent and • restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15 or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors these provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital in either case representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in case of issuances from authorized capital until march 2 2018 unless reauthorized by shareholders for a subsequent twoyear period without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders preemptive rights or advance subscription rights for the purpose of the defense of an actual threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid in relation to which the board of directors upon consultation with an independent financial advisor has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders we note that swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital in addition the new york stock exchange nyse on which our shares are listed requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power with limited exceptions 

  legislative and regulatory actions and proposals in switzerland the us and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

various us and nonus legislative and regulatory proposals have been directed at multinational companies with operations in lowertax jurisdictions there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives such as 

• the oecds initiative to develop agreedupon best practices to prevent base erosion and profit shifting which contemplate changes to numerous longstanding tax principles related to the distribution of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions • corporate tax reform in switzerland which is proposed in response to oecd and eu concerns • eu and other country efforts to adopt certain oecd proposals and modified oecd proposals including the antitax avoidance directive state aid cases and various transparency proposals and • tax policy in the us such as federal tax reform and revisions to the model income tax treaty 18 

if these proposals are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business they could among other things cause double taxation increase audit risk and materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us 

  legislation in the us could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to us companies that have moved to lowertax jurisdictions 

we expect the us congress to continue to consider implementation andor expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad we cannot predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals therefore we cannot provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us in addition we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to us federal or state governments or the willingness of our nongovernmental customers to do business with us as a result of these uncertainties we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us 

  swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

as we are organized under the laws of switzerland it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us and switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws would not be allowed in swiss courts as they are contrary to that nations public policy 

swiss law differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers thus holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 







 item 2 properties 

our principal executive office is located in schaffhausen switzerland as of fiscal year end 2017 we owned approximately 20 million square feet and leased approximately 10 million square feet of manufacturing warehousing and office space we believe our facilities are suitable for the conduct of our business and adequate for our current needs 

we manufacture our products in approximately 25 countries worldwide our manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of our manufacturing processes including our primary processes of stamping plating molding extrusion beaming and assembly we consider the productive capacity of our manufacturing facilities sufficient as of fiscal year end 2017 our principal centers of manufacturing output by segment and geographic region were as follows 






 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax in addition we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims at any given time in the normal course of business we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions if infringement of a third partys patent were to be determined against us we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products if a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our consolidated balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge which could be significant in amount 

management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

fiscal 2017 highlights included the following 

• our fiscal 2017 net sales increased 71 over fiscal 2016 levels due to growth in the transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments and to a lesser degree the communications solutions segment on an organic basis our net sales increased 60 in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 • our net sales by segment were as follows • transportation solutions —our net sales increased 82 as a result of increased sales in the automotive and commercial transportation end markets and to a lesser degree the sensors end market • industrial solutions —our net sales increased 91 due to increased sales in the industrial equipment end market where we benefitted from sales contributions from recent acquisitions partially offset by decreased sales in the aerospace defense oil and gas and the energy end markets • communications solutions —our net sales increased 19 due primarily to sales increases in the appliances and subsea communications end markets partially offset by sales declines in the data and devices end market resulting from the divestiture of our circuit protection devices cpd business in fiscal 2016 • during fiscal 2017 our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of 160 per share payable in four equal quarterly installments of 040 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 • net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 2322 million in fiscal 2017 outlook 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we expect our net sales to be between 335 billion and 345 billion as compared to 3063 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we expect our net sales 

to be between 137 billion and 141 billion in fiscal 2018 as compared to 13113 million in fiscal 2017 these increases reflect sales growth in the transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments and to a lesser degree the communications solutions segment relative to the same periods of fiscal 2017 

additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2017 and for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 is as follows 

• transportation solutions —we expect our net sales to increase in the automotive end market due primarily to increased content per vehicle and sales contributions from a recent acquisition we expect global automotive production to be flat in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and to increase approximately 1 in fiscal 2018 we also expect continued growth in the commercial transportation and sensors end markets • industrial solutions —we expect our net sales to increase in the industrial equipment end market due primarily to continued growth in the factory automation and controls market and the medical market • communications solutions —we expect our net sales growth in the appliances and the data and devices end markets to be partially offset by sales declines in the subsea communications end market in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of 112 to 116 per share we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of 478 to 498 per share in fiscal 2018

the following table provides an analysis of the change in the communications solutions segments net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by primary industry end market 



net sales in the communications solutions segment increased 47 million or 19 in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 as a result of organic net sales growth of 54 partially offset by sales declines resulting from a divestiture of 28 and the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 

07 fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed 43 million in net sales our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows 

• data and devices —our organic net sales increased 23 in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of increased sales to cloud infrastructure customers partially offset by sales declines resulting from weakness in the wireless market • subsea communications —our organic net sales increased 49 in fiscal 2017 as a result of increased project activity • appliances —our organic net sales increased 108 in fiscal 2017 due primarily to growth in the asia–pacific region as a result of increased market demand and share gains in fiscal 2016 net sales in the communications solutions segment decreased 183 million or 68 as compared to fiscal 2015 due to sales declines resulting from a divestiture of 46 organic net sales declines of 16 and the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 06 as discussed above the additional week contributed 43 million in net sales in fiscal 2016 our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows

excluding these items operating income increased in fiscal 2017 due primarily to higher volume and improved manufacturing productivity partially offset by price erosion in fiscal 2016 excluding these items operating income increased as a result of lower material costs and savings attributable to restructuring actions partially offset by the impact of unfavorable product mix lower volume and price erosion 

liquidity and capital resources 

our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets money markets or other sources of funding as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements we believe that cash generated from operations and to the extent necessary these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future we may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program to acquire strategic businesses or product lines to pay dividends on our common shares or to reduce our outstanding debt including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law payment of our 708 million of 655 senior notes due in october 2017 was made after fiscal year end 2017 the cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions we will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions 

as of fiscal year end 2017 our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world under current applicable laws substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to tyco electronics group sa tegsa our luxembourg subsidiary which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt and to te connectivity ltd our swiss parent company however the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense we provide for tax liabilities on the consolidated financial statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations as of fiscal year end 2017 we had approximately 63 billion of cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits principally in our subsidiaries that we have the ability to distribute to tegsa and te connectivity ltd but we consider to be permanently reinvested we estimate that approximately 12 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the consolidated financial statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations including investing and financing activities 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased 278 million to 2322 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to 2044 million in fiscal 2016 the increase resulted primarily from higher pretax income levels an increase in accrued and other current liabilities related to employee compensation and a decrease in net payments related to preseparation tax matters partially offset by the impact of increased sales on accounts receivable levels 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 2044 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to 1636 million in fiscal 2015 the increase resulted primarily from the favorable effects of changes in accounts receivable and inventory levels partially offset by an increase in net payments related to preseparation tax matters 

the amount of income taxes paid net of refunds during fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 was 323 million 806 million and 350 million respectively in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 these amounts included refunds of 23 million payments of 471 million and payments of 47 million respectively related to preseparation tax matters during fiscal 2016 and 2015 we received net reimbursements of 321 million and 7 million respectively from tyco international and covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for preseparation tax matters

pension contributions in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 were 48 million 67 million and 66 million respectively we expect pension contributions to be 62 million in fiscal 2018 before consideration of any voluntary contributions there were no voluntary pension contributions in fiscal 2017 2016 or 2015 

cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures were 702 million 628 million and 600 million in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively we expect fiscal 2018 capital spending levels to be approximately 5 of net sales we believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities 

we acquired two businesses during fiscal 2017 for a combined cash purchase price of 250 million net of cash acquired during fiscal 2016 we acquired four businesses including creganna for a combined cash purchase price of 13 billion net of cash acquired during fiscal 2015 we acquired measurement specialties the total value paid for the transaction was approximately 17 billion net of cash acquired and included 225 million for the repayment of measurement specialties debt and accrued interest also during fiscal 2015 we acquired three additional businesses for 241 million in cash net of cash acquired see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding acquisitions 

during fiscal 2016 we received net cash proceeds of 333 million related to the sale of our cpd business see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information we received net cash proceeds of 30 billion related to the sale of our bns business during fiscal 2015 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

cash flows from financing activities and capitalization 

total debt at fiscal year end 2017 and 2016 was 4344 million and 4070 million respectively see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt 

during august 2017 tegsa our 100owned subsidiary issued 400 million aggregate principal amount of 3125 senior notes due august 2027 and 100 million aggregate principal amount of 345 senior notes due august 2024 the 345 senior notes were issued under an existing indenture under which tegsa had previously issued 250 million aggregate principal amount the notes are tegsas unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of tegsa and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that tegsa may incur 

tegsa has a fiveyear unsecured senior revolving credit facility credit facility with a maturity date of december 2020 and total commitments of 1500 million tegsa had no borrowings under the credit facility at fiscal year end 2017 or 2016 

the credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if as of the last day of each fiscal quarter our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 375 to 10 an event of default as defined in the credit facility is triggered the credit facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants none of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations as of fiscal year end 2017 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future 

periodically tegsa issues commercial paper to us institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility 

and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the credit facility 

tegsas payment obligations under its senior notes commercial paper and credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent te connectivity ltd 

payments of common share dividends to shareholders were 546 million 509 million and 502 million in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding dividends on our common shares 

future dividends on our common shares if any must be approved by our shareholders in exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends be approved our board of directors will consider our results of operations cash requirements and surplus financial condition statutory requirements of applicable law contractual restrictions and other factors that they may deem relevant 

during fiscal 2016 and 2015 our board of directors authorized increases of 10 billion and 30 billion respectively in the share repurchase program we repurchased approximately 8 million of our common shares for 621 million 43 million of our common shares for 2610 million and 18 million of our common shares for 1163 million under the share repurchase program during fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively at fiscal year end 2017 we had 480 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization 

commitments and contingencies 

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable leases and other obligations at fiscal year end 2017 



1 debt represents principal payments see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt 2 interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps 3 purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services 4 the above table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of 501 million and related accrued interest and penalties of 60 million the timing of which is uncertain see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits interest and penalties 5 the above table does not reflect pension obligations to certain employees and former employees we are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans however we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type including timing interest rate charges investment performance and amounts of benefit payments we expect to contribute 62 million to pension plans in fiscal 2018 before consideration of any voluntary contributions see note 14 to the 

consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments 

6 other longterm liabilities of 482 million are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items 

legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including patent infringement claims product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in certain instances we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2018 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

at fiscal year end 2017 we had outstanding letters of credit letters of guarantee and surety bonds of 298 million 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

revenue recognition 

our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 605 revenue recognition  our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer this generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies a reserve for 

other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and also is recorded as a reduction of sales 

contract revenues for construction related projects which are generated in the communications solutions segment are recorded primarily using the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete percentageofcompletion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable in addition provisions for credit losses related to unbilled receivables on construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

intangible assets include both indeterminablelived residual goodwill and determinablelived identifiable intangible assets intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property consisting of patents trademarks and unpatented technology and customer relationships recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straightline basis evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinablelived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant 

we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management at fiscal year end 2017 we had six reporting units five of which contained goodwill there were two reporting units in each of our three segments when changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values we review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test or more frequently based on changes in our structure 

goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred in assessing the existence of a triggering event management relies on a number of reporting unitspecific factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis 

when testing for goodwill impairment we perform a step i goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill may be impaired and a step ii goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment if any in the step ii goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 

fair value estimates used in the step i goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit the income approach 

generally has been supported by guideline analyses a market approach these approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates discount rates income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and determined that no impairment existed 

income taxes 

in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of pretax operating income in various tax jurisdictions the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 income taxes  we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

pension liabilities 

our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions the funded status of our plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at 

the measurement date the projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels the fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds held for the sole benefit of participants which are invested by the trustee of the funds the benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors such as years of service and compensation 

net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants 

two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and employee turnover these assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations at fiscal year end 2017 a 25basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by 134 million a 25basis point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by 120 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a 50basis point decrease or increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets would have increased or decreased respectively our fiscal 2017 pension expense by 11 million 

the longterm target asset allocation in our us plans master trust is 10 equity and 90 fixed income asset reallocation to meet that target is occurring over a multiyear period based on the funded status we expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 105 based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2017 our target asset allocation is 45 equity and 55 fixed income 

accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued and recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

nongaap financial measure 

organic net sales growth 

we present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with gaap organic net sales growth represents net sales growth the most comparable gaap financial measure excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months if any organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under managements control such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company such as acquisition and divestiture activity 

organic net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance also management uses organic net sales growth together with gaap financial measures in its 

decisionmaking processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company it is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations the tables presented in results of operations and segment results provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with gaap 

organic net sales growth is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with gaap this nongaap financial measure may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures reported by other companies the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results this limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth in order to better understand the amounts character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts 

forwardlooking information 

certain statements in this annual report are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the us private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management forwardlooking statements include among others the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations business strategies financing plans competitive position potential growth opportunities potential operating performance improvements acquisitions divestitures the effects of competition and the effects of future legislation or regulations forwardlooking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as the words believe expect plan intend anticipate estimate predict potential continue may should or the negative of these terms or similar expressions 

forwardlooking statements involve risks uncertainties and assumptions actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements investors should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements we do not have any intention or obligation to update forwardlooking statements after we file this report except as required by law 

the following and other risks which are described in greater detail in part i item 1a risk factors as well as other risks described in this annual report could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements 

• conditions in the global or regional economies and global capital markets and cyclical industry conditions • conditions affecting demand for products in the industries we serve particularly the automotive industry • competition and pricing pressure • market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations and product life cycles • raw material availability quality and cost • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates • financial condition and consolidation of customers and vendors • reliance on thirdparty suppliers • risks associated with current and future acquisitions and divestitures 45 

• global risks of business interruptions such as natural disasters and political economic and military instability • risks associated with security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure • risks related to compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations • our ability to protect our intellectual property rights • risks of litigation • our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by our debt instruments • the possible effects on us of various us and nonus legislative proposals and other initiatives that if adopted could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate and negatively impact our us government contracts business • various risks associated with being a swiss corporation • the impact of fluctuations in the market price of our shares and • the impact of certain provisions of our articles of association on unsolicited takeover proposals there may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency movements on outstanding debt and nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks 

we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an aa2 credit rating there is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty 

foreign currency exposures 

as part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we utilize crosscurrency swap contracts foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency swap contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts foreign currency forward contracts or foreign currency swap contracts from the fiscal year end 2017 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 122 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts foreign currency forward contracts or foreign currency swap contracts from the fiscal year end 2016 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 112 million such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the losses or gains on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions 

interest rate and investment exposures 

we issue debt as needed to fund our operations and capital requirements such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure to manage the interest rate exposure we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixedrate debt into variablerate debt we use forward starting interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixedrate debt we also utilize investment swaps to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities 

based on our floating rate debt balances at fiscal year end 2017 and 2016 an increase in the levels of the us dollar interest rates by 05 with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an immaterial increase in interest expense in both fiscal 2017 and 2016 

commodity exposures 

our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges we continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period at fiscal year end 2017 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net gain position of 20 million and had a notional value of 314 million at fiscal year end 2016 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net gain position of 11 million and had a notional value of 232 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the fiscal year end 2017 prices would have changed the unrealized 

value of our forward contracts by 33 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the fiscal year end 2016 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 24 million

customers 

as an industry leader we have established close working relationships with many of our customers these relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions by working with our customers in developing new products and technologies we believe we are able to identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about nextgeneration technology across our products 

our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support we believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers 

we manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries and our relationships with them typically date back many years we believe that this diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance additionally we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors 

there is no single customer that accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2016 2015 or 2014 

sales and distribution 

we maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate our net sales by geographic region 1 as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows 



1 net sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale 2 the americas region includes our subsea communications business 

see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional geographic information relating to our business 

we sell our products into approximately 150 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers we also sell some of our products indirectly via thirdparty distributors in fiscal 2016 our direct sales represented 80 of total net sales 

we maintain distribution centers around the world our global coverage positions us near our customers locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs we believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile 

products are generally delivered to distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer in some instances however product is delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer we contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products via road rail sea and air 

seasonality and backlog 

we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business overall the third and fourth fiscal quarters are typically the strongest quarters of our fiscal year whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by winter holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets 

certain of our end markets experience some seasonality our sales into the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production and seasonal declines in european production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter also our sales into the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases 

customer orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business conditions and cancellation of unfilled orders prior to shipment of goods backlog by reportable segment was as follows 



1 includes our subsea communications business backlog of 1047 million and 995 million at fiscal year end 2016 and 2015 respectively 

we expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2016 will be filled during fiscal 2017 

competition 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers competition is generally on the basis of breadth of product offering product innovation price quality delivery and service our markets have generally been growing but with downward pressure on prices 

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products the principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding precious metals such as gold and silver for plating and other metals such as copper aluminum brass and steel for manufacturing cable contacts and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers the prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas where we may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition 

our research and development expense was as follows 



our capital spending and investment in product and process engineering and development enable us to consistently provide innovative highquality products with efficient manufacturing methods in fiscal 2016 we derived approximately 20 of our net sales from new products including product extensions introduced within the previous three fiscal years 

intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including patents and patent applications as available in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical optical and electronic products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks 

while we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents 

te connectivity and te connectivity logo are trademarks © 2016 te connectivity ltd all rights reserved 

management team and employees 

we believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership our chief executive officer president and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience they are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry 

our strong employee base along with their commitment to uncompromising values provides the foundation of our companys success we continue to emphasize employee development and training and we embrace diversity and inclusion 

we have employees located throughout the world as of fiscal year end 2016 we employed approximately 75000 people worldwide of whom 23000 were in the americas region 28000 were in the emea region and 24000 were in the asia–pacific region of our total employees approximately 46000 were employed in manufacturing 

government regulation and supervision 

the import and export of products are subject to regulation by the united states us and other countries a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events we have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction 

environmental 

our operations are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment greenhouse gas emissions hazardous materials in products and chemical usage we are committed to complying with these laws 

and to the protection of our employees and the environment we maintain a global environmental health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards staff dedicated to environmental health and safety issues periodic compliance auditing training and other measures we also have a program for compliance with the european union eu restriction of hazardous substances and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the china restriction of hazardous substances law the eu registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach regulation and similar laws 

compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future for example laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection management and reporting and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products we also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations based upon our experience current information and applicable laws we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of 17 million to 42 million and that the best estimate within this range is 20 million we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2017 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business also is subject to general risks that affect many other companies additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations financial condition and liquidity 

risks relating to the macroeconomic environment and our global presence 

  conditions in global or regional economies capital and money markets and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit end demand from consumer and industrial markets and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults any of which could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow and ability to obtain financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full further our vendors may experience similar problems which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels if regional or global economic conditions deteriorate our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected also 

deterioration in economic conditions could trigger the recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other longlived assets impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position 

  foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue approximately 54 of our net sales for fiscal 2016 were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect nonus dollar revenue to represent a significant and likely increased portion of our future net revenue we have elected not to hedge this foreign currency exposure therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro or asian currencies our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease 

we manage certain cash intercompany and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts in addition to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to these contracts our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful 

  we could suffer significant business interruptions 

our operations and those of our suppliers and customers and the supply chains that support their operations may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis typhoons or floods or other disasters such as fires explosions acts of terrorism or war disease or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

  we could be adversely affected by a decline in the market value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets 

concerns about deterioration in the global economy together with concerns about credit inflation or deflation have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities including fixed income and equity securities which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans investment portfolios in addition the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved a decrease in the value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding 

the global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit recent downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital as a result we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures the extent of any impact will depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions 

  we are subject to global risks of political economic and military instability 

our workforce manufacturing research administrative and sales facilities markets customers and suppliers are located throughout the world as a result we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including 

• tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes • regulations related to customs and importexport matters • variations in lengths of payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable • tax law and regulatory changes in the us and eu among other jurisdictions including tax law and regulatory changes that may be effected as a result of tax policy recommendations from quasigovernmental organizations such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd examinations by taxing authorities variations in tax laws from country to country changes to the terms of income tax treaties and difficulties in the taxefficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions • employment regulations and local labor conditions including increases in employment costs particularly in lowcost regions in which we currently operate • difficulties protecting intellectual property • instability in economic or political conditions including sovereign debt levels eurozone uncertainty inflation recession actual or anticipated military or political conflicts and any impact as a result of the proposed exit of the united kingdom from the eu and • the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements we have sizeable operations in china including 15 manufacturing sites in addition approximately 17 of our net sales in fiscal 2016 were made to customers in china economic conditions in china have been and may continue to be volatile and uncertain in addition the legal system in china is still developing and subject to change accordingly our operations and orders for products in china could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions or interpretation of chinese law 

in addition any downgrade by rating agencies of longterm us sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions which could negatively affect our business financial condition and liquidity 

risks relating to the industry in which we operate 

  we are dependent on the automotive and other industries 

we are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets periodic downturns in our customers industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

approximately 40 of our net sales for fiscal 2016 were to customers in the automotive industry the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers additionally the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions as a supplier of automotive electronics products our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic and credit conditions and changes in the operations products business models partsourcing requirements financial condition and market share of automotive manufacturers as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers 

during fiscal 2016 approximately 12 of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market 9 of our net sales were to customers in the aerospace defense oil and gas end market and 8 of our net sales were to customers in the data and devices end market demand for industrial equipment is dependent upon economic conditions including customer investment in intelligent buildings factory automation and process control systems as well as market conditions in the medical rail transportation solar and lighting and other major industrial markets we serve the aerospace and defense industry has undergone significant fluctuations in demand depending on worldwide economic and political conditions demand in the oil and gas market is impacted by oil price volatility the data and devices industry can experience variability in demand depending on the underlying business and consumer demand for computer and consumer electronics products 

  we encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry 

we operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology our ability to participate in emerging markets and customers expectations relating to socially responsible operations the competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large diversified manufacturers to small highly specialized manufacturers the electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities a number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products we cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue 

substantially all of the markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences which are rapid in certain end markets our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design develop introduce and sell new and innovative products to modify existing products and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change there are numerous risks inherent in these processes including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands 

  like other suppliers to the electronics industry we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices 

we have historically experienced and we expect to continue to experience continuing pressure to lower our prices in recent years we have experienced price erosion averaging from 1 to 2 each year in order to maintain our margins we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts we cannot provide assurance that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate 

many of the industries to which we sell our products as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials have become more concentrated in recent years including the automotive data and devices and aerospace and defense industries consolidation of customers may lead to decreased 

product purchases from us in addition as our customers buy in larger volumes their volume buying power has increased enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing these trends may adversely affect the margins on our products particularly for commodity components 

  the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short 

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle as a result the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment if we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

risks relating to our operations 

  our results are sensitive to raw material availability quality and cost 

we are a large buyer of resin copper gold silver brass steel chemicals and additives zinc and other precious metals many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers in addition the price of many of these raw materials including gold and copper continues to fluctuate if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are significant price increases for these raw materials it could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers our margins may decline materially affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices the success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials we could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate 

in accordance with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use tin tantalum tungsten or gold conflict minerals or 3tg mined from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries together with the drc the covered countries in their products these requirements could affect the sourcing pricing and availability of 3tg used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who can demonstrate that they do not source any 3tg from the covered countries and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain nonconflict 3tg in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices further since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures 

  we may use components and products manufactured by third parties 

we may rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we may rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if these third parties fail to deliver quality products parts and components on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

  our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain executive management employees and limitations affecting retention and hiring including swiss regulations could have a negative impact on our business and increase our expenses 

our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our executive management employees and hire new executive management employees to replace succeed or add to members of our executive management team our executive management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for executive talent is intense and we compete for these personnel with other companies that are regulated by the laws of jurisdictions that provide significantly greater flexibility than switzerland our jurisdiction of incorporation in compensation practices for executive management employees 

  security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise confidential information and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise information belonging to us our employees customers and suppliers and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation in the normal course of business we rely on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally we collect and store certain data including proprietary business information and customer and employee data and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our cybersecurity measures including employee and thirdparty training monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems which are continuously reviewed and upgraded our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in operations and damage to our reputation which could materially adversely affect our business while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure to date none of these threats has had a material impact on our business or operations 

  covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our fiveyear unsecured senior revolving credit facility credit facility contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens our outstanding notes indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate merge and sell assets 

although none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations our continued ability to meet the credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant a breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our credit facility if the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding 

under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder 

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

  the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors including 

• our quarterly or annual earnings • changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results • volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global and regional economic conditions and investors concerns about potential risks to future economic growth • changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates • changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles • announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions and • the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business risks relating to strategic transactions 

  future acquisitions may not be successful 

we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings we cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future we also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity 

if we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements this acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to make an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares 

  divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered 

risks relating to intellectual property litigation and regulations 

  our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology 

the electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights within this industry companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights depending on the importance of the technology product patent trademark or trade secret in question an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the normal course of business we are from time to time a defendant in litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights anticompetitive behavior product liability breach of contract and employmentrelated claims in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  if any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations our business may suffer 

our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the us and the eu these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we may also be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable if we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements whether at all or in material part our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected further any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdoms bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdoms bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance program we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation government enforcement actions and reputational risk 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate and where our products are sold these laws and regulations govern among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials • emissions or discharges of substances into the environment • investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites • greenhouse gas emissions • product hazardous material content and • the health and safety of our employees we may not have been or we may not at all times be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators in addition environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigation removal and remediation costs under certain federal and state laws is retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and other environmental agencies that conditions at a number of currently and formerlyowned or operated sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites we also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation andor remediation is necessary 

while we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our 

results of operations financial position and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury property damage andor cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

  our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage hazardous material content and recycling 

the eu china and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal use of hazardous materials in products use of chemicals in manufacturing recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters these laws include the eu restriction of hazardous substances end of life vehicle and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the eu reach regulation the china law on management methods for controlling pollution by electronic information products and various other laws these laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes registration chemical testing labeling and other matters these laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale these laws could make manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions 

risks relating to our swiss jurisdiction of incorporation 

  as a swiss corporation we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares 

as a swiss corporation our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements in addition our articles of association allow us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors but this authorization is limited to i authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years which authorization period ends on march 2 2018 approved by our shareholders at our march 2 2016 annual meeting of shareholders and ii conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation dividends andor voting moreover under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convene a meeting of shareholders which would delay the timing to execute such actions such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management while we do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors 

  we might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

in order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of swiss withholding tax we anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes or registered share capital various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital or that swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

under swiss corporate law which applies to us the registered share capital in our unconsolidated swiss statutory financial statements is required to be denominated in swiss francs since distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in us dollars shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital if the us dollar were to increase in value relative to the swiss franc the us dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without swiss withholding tax will decrease 

  we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares 

the swiss code of obligations regulates a corporations ability to hold or repurchase its own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation additionally various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to repurchase our shares our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings 

our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by swiss law for swiss companies like us that issue registered shares as opposed to bearer shares this provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights holders of our shares must be registered in our share register aktienbuch as shareholders with voting rights only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders meetings but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends distributions preemptive rights advance subscription rights and liquidation proceeds the board of directors may in its discretion refuse to 

register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association additionally various proposals in switzerland for corporate law changes if passed in the future may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and banks such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable 

our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered antitakeover provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors under these provisions among others 

• shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent and • restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15 or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors these provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital in either case representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in case of issuances from authorized capital until march 2 2018 unless reauthorized by shareholders for a subsequent twoyear period without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders preemptive rights or advance subscription rights for the purpose of the defense of an actual threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid in relation to which the board of directors upon consultation with an independent financial advisor has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders we note that swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital in addition the nyse on which our shares are listed requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power with limited exceptions 

  legislative and regulatory actions and proposals in switzerland the us and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

various us and nonus legislative and regulatory proposals have been directed at multinational companies with operations in lower tax jurisdictions there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives such as 

• the organisation for economic cooperation and developments initiative to develop agreedupon best practices to prevent base erosion and profit shifting which contemplate changes to numerous longstanding tax principles related to the distribution of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions • corporate tax reform in switzerland which is proposed in response to oecd and eu concerns • eu and other country efforts to adopt certain oecd proposals and modified oecd proposals including the antitax avoidance directive state aid cases and various transparency proposals and 18 

• tax policy in the us such as the recently issued final and temporary debtequity regulations under internal revenue code section 385 revisions to the model income tax treaty and other international tax reform proposals if these proposals are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business they could among other things cause double taxation increase audit risk and materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us 

  legislation in the us could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to us companies that have moved to lowertax jurisdictions 

we expect the us congress to continue to consider implementation andor expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad we cannot predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals therefore we cannot provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us in addition we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to us federal or state governments or the willingness of our nongovernmental customers to do business with us as a result of these uncertainties we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us 

  swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

as we are organized under the laws of switzerland it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us and switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws would not be allowed in swiss courts as they are contrary to that nations public policy 

swiss corporate law differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers thus holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 







 item 2 properties 

our principal executive office is located in schaffhausen switzerland as of fiscal year end 2016 we owned approximately 19 million square feet and leased approximately 10 million square feet of manufacturing warehousing and office space we believe our facilities are suitable for the conduct of our business and adequate for our current needs 

we manufacture our products in approximately 25 countries worldwide our manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of the manufacturing processes including our primary processes of stamping plating molding extrusion beaming and assembly we consider the productive capacity of our manufacturing facilities sufficient as of fiscal year end 2016 our principal centers of manufacturing output by segment and geographic region were as follows 






 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax in addition we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims at any given time in the normal course of business we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions if infringement of a third partys patent were to be determined against us we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products if a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our consolidated balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge which could be significant in amount 

management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

overview 

we are a global technology leader we design and manufacture connectivity and sensor solutions that are essential in todays increasingly connected world we help our customers solve the need for intelligent efficient and highperforming products and solutions 

fiscal 2016 highlights included the following 

• overall our net sales were flat in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 as increased net sales in the transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments were offset by declines in the communications solutions segment foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 254 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 on an organic basis our net sales increased 15 during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 • our net sales by segment were as follows • transportation solutions —our net sales increased 24 due to increased sales in the automotive end market and to a lesser degree the sensors and commercial transportation end markets • industrial solutions —our net sales increased 11 due to increased sales in the industrial equipment end market which benefitted from sales contributions from acquisitions partially offset by decreased sales in the aerospace defense oil and gas and the energy end markets • communications solutions —our net sales decreased 68 due primarily to sales declines in the data and devices end market partially offset by sales increases in the subsea communications end market • fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed 238 million in net sales and 013 per share to diluted earnings per share • during fiscal 2016 our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of 148 per issued share payable in four quarterly installments of 037 beginning with the third fiscal quarter of 2016 and ending in the second fiscal quarter of 2017 26 

• net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 2019 million and free cash flow was 1585 million in fiscal 2016 • during fiscal 2016 we acquired the creganna medical group creganna a global leader in the design and manufacture of minimally invasive delivery and access medical devices also during fiscal 2016 we completed the divestiture our cpd business outlook 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we expect net sales to be between 295 billion and 305 billion this reflects sales growth in the industrial solutions and transportation solutions segments partially offset by sales declines in the communications solutions segment relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2016 additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2016 is as follows 

• transportation solutions —we expect our net sales growth in the automotive end market to exceed anticipated growth in global automotive production of approximately 2 due primarily to growth in china and the emea region we also expect our net sales to increase in the commercial transportation and sensors end markets • industrial solutions —we expect our net sales to increase in the industrial equipment end market due primarily to recent acquisitions we expect our net sales growth in the aerospace and defense market to be partially offset by market weakness and sales declines in the oil and gas market • communications solutions —we expect our net sales to decline in the data and devices end market primarily as a result of the divestiture of our cpd business this decline is expected to be partially offset by sales growth in the appliances and subsea communications end markets we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of 084 to 088 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 

for fiscal 2017 we expect net sales to be between 123 billion and 129 billion an increase from 122 billion in fiscal 2016 which included an additional week this increase is attributable to sales growth in the industrial solutions and transportation solutions segments partially offset by sales declines in the communications solutions segment additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 is as follows 

• transportation solutions —we expect our net sales increase in the automotive end market to outpace expected growth in global automotive production of approximately 1 as a result of increased content per vehicle and market share gains we also expect our net sales to increase in the commercial transportation and sensors end markets • industrial solutions —we expect our net sales to increase in the industrial equipment end market due primarily to recent acquisitions also we expect net sales growth in the aerospace and defense market • communications solutions —we expect our net sales growth in the subsea communications and appliances end markets to be more than offset by sales declines in the data and devices end market due primarily to the divestiture of our cpd business we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of 384 to 414 per share in fiscal 2017 

the above outlook is based on foreign exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels 

we are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment including the proposed exit of the united kingdom from the eu and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve we continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions additionally we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources

results of operations 

net sales 

the following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by segment 



the following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by segment 



net sales were flat in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 organic net sales growth of 15 and net sales contributions from acquisitions and a divestiture of 06 were offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 21 due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies organic net sales were adversely affected by price erosion of 188 million in fiscal 2016 fiscal 2016 included an additional week which contributed 238 million in net sales the impact of the additional week was estimated using an average weekly sales figure for the last month of the fiscal year 

net sales increased 260 million or 22 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 the increase in net sales resulted from sales contributions from acquisitions of 59 and organic net sales growth of 38 partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 75 due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies during fiscal 2015 measurement specialties contributed net sales of 548 million organic net sales were adversely affected by price erosion of 208 million in fiscal 2015 

see further discussion of net sales below under segment results 

net sales by geographic region our business operates in three geographic regions—the americas emea and asia–pacific—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into us dollars at the end of each fiscal period we sell our products into approximately 150 countries and approximately 54 of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar in fiscal 2016 the percentage of net sales in fiscal 2016 by major currencies invoiced was as follows

the following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by geographic region 



cost of sales and gross margin 

the following table presents cost of sales and gross margin information 



in fiscal 2016 gross margin decreased 54 million as compared to fiscal 2015 in fiscal 2016 gross margin included charges of 10 million from the amortization of acquisitionrelated fair value adjustments to acquired inventories and customer order backlog associated primarily with creganna in fiscal 2015 gross margin included charges of 36 million from the amortization of acquisitionrelated fair value adjustments to acquired inventories and customer order backlog associated primarily with measurement specialties excluding these charges the gross margin decreased in fiscal 2016 due primarily to unfavorable product mix and price erosion partially offset by lower material costs 

gross margin increased 115 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in fiscal 2015 gross margin included charges of 36 million associated with the acquisition of measurement specialties excluding these charges gross margin increased in fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of higher volume and improved manufacturing productivity partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and price erosion 

cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices and the price of many of our raw materials continues to fluctuate in fiscal 2016 we purchased approximately 

170 million pounds of copper 115000 troy ounces of gold and 24 million troy ounces of silver the following table sets forth the average prices incurred related to copper gold and silver 



in fiscal 2017 we expect to purchase approximately 177 million pounds of copper 129000 troy ounces of gold and 25 million troy ounces of silver 

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expense information 



selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016 selling general and administrative expenses decreased 41 million as compared to fiscal 2015 due primarily to cost control measures and savings attributable to restructuring actions 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 30 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 the decrease resulted primarily from cost control measures and savings attributable to restructuring actions partially offset by additional expenses associated with measurement specialties 

research development and engineering expenses research development and engineering expenses increased 17 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 and 44 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 the increases resulted from additional expenses related to acquisitions and growth initiatives primarily in the transportation solutions segment 

acquisition and integration costs in fiscal 2016 we incurred acquisition and integration costs of 22 million related primarily to the acquisitions of creganna and measurement specialties in fiscal 2015 we incurred acquisition and integration costs of 55 million related primarily to the acquisitions of measurement specialties and seacon in fiscal 2014 we incurred acquisition and integration costs of 31 million primarily in connection with the acquisition of seacon 

restructuring and other charges net we are committed to continuous productivity improvements and consistently evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint migrate facilities to lowercost regions reduce fixed costs and eliminate excess capacity these initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry improve our operating leverage and position us for future growth 

during fiscal 2016 we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the communications solutions segment during fiscal 2015 we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions and product line 

closures primarily impacting the communications solutions and industrial solutions segments during fiscal 2014 we initiated a restructuring program associated primarily with headcount reductions and manufacturing site and product line closures in the communications solutions segment 

in connection with these initiatives we recorded net restructuring charges of 125 million 93 million and 23 million in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2016 are expected to be approximately 150 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2017 cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2017 we expect net restructuring charges to be similar to fiscal 2016 levels we expect total spending which will be funded with cash from operations to be approximately 110 million in fiscal 2017 

during fiscal 2016 we recognized a pretax gain of 144 million on the sale of our cpd business 

during fiscal 2016 and 2015 we incurred net other charges of 21 million and 59 million respectively primarily in connection with the divestiture of certain businesses

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows 



our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets money markets or other sources of funding as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements we believe that cash generated from operations and to the extent necessary these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future we may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program to acquire strategic businesses or product lines to pay distributions or dividends 

on our common shares or to reduce our outstanding debt including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law the cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions we will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions 

as of fiscal year end 2016 our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world under current applicable laws substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to tyco electronics group sa tegsa our luxembourg subsidiary which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt and to te connectivity ltd our swiss parent company however the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense we provide for tax liabilities on the consolidated financial statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations as of fiscal year end 2016 we had approximately 69 billion of cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits principally in our subsidiaries that we have the ability to distribute to tegsa and te connectivity ltd but we consider to be permanently reinvested we estimate that up to approximately 15 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the consolidated financial statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations including investing and financing activities 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 2019 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to 1619 million in fiscal 2015 the increase resulted primarily from favorable effects of changes in accounts receivable and inventory levels partially offset by an increase in net payments related to preseparation tax matters 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities decreased 185 million to 1619 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to 1804 million in fiscal 2014 the decrease resulted primarily from the unfavorable effects of changes in working capital levels partially offset by a decrease in net payments related to preseparation tax matters 

pension contributions in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 were 67 million 66 million and 87 million respectively we expect pension contributions to be 54 million in fiscal 2017 before consideration of any voluntary contributions there were no voluntary pension contributions in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 

the amount of income taxes paid net of refunds during fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 was 806 million 350 million and 259 million respectively in fiscal 2016 and 2015 these payments included 471 million and 47 million respectively for tax deficiencies related to preseparation tax matters also during fiscal 2016 and 2015 we received net reimbursements of 321 million and 7 million respectively from tyco international and covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for preseparation tax matters during fiscal 2014 we made net payments of 179 million to tyco international and covidien pursuant to our indemnifications for preseparation tax matters see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to preseparation tax matters 

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities we use free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as a useful measure of our ability to generate cash free cash flow was 1585 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to 1076 million in fiscal 2015 and 1477 million in fiscal 2014 the increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was driven primarily by favorable effects of changes in accounts receivable and inventory levels the decrease in free cash flow in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was driven primarily by the changes in net cash provided by continuing operating activities discussed above and higher proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment in fiscal 2014 

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities the most comparable gaap financial measure to free cash flow 



cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures were 628 million 600 million and 635 million in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we expect fiscal 2017 capital spending levels to be approximately 5 of net sales we believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities 

proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment for fiscal 2014 included approximately 100 million related to the sale of real estate 

during fiscal 2016 we acquired four businesses including creganna for a combined cash purchase price of 13 billion net of cash acquired during fiscal 2015 we acquired measurement specialties the total value paid for the transaction was approximately 17 billion net of cash acquired and included 225 million for the repayment of measurement specialties debt and accrued interest also during fiscal 2015 we acquired three additional businesses for 241 million in cash net of cash acquired during fiscal 2014 we acquired five businesses for 522 million in cash net of cash acquired see additional information in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

during fiscal 2016 we received net cash proceeds of 333 million related to the sale of our cpd business see additional information in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

during fiscal 2015 we received net cash proceeds of 30 billion related to the sale of our bns business see additional information in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

cash flows from financing activities and capitalization 

total debt at fiscal year end 2016 and 2015 was 4070 million and 3884 million respectively see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt 

during january 2016 tegsa our 100owned subsidiary issued 350 million aggregate principal amount of 3700 senior notes due february 15 2026 the notes are tegsas unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of tegsa and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that tegsa may incur 

tegsa has a fiveyear unsecured senior revolving credit facility credit facility with total commitments of 1500 million the credit facility was amended in december 2015 primarily to extend the maturity date from august 2018 to december 2020 tegsa had no borrowings under the credit facility at fiscal year end 2016 and 2015 

the credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if as of the last day of each fiscal quarter our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 375 to 10 an event of default as defined in the credit facility is triggered the credit facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants none of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations as of fiscal year end 2016 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future 

periodically tegsa issues commercial paper to us institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the credit facility 

tegsas payment obligations under its senior notes commercial paper and credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent te connectivity ltd 

payments of common share dividends to shareholders were 509 million 502 million and 443 million in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding dividends and cash distributions on our common shares 

future dividends on our common shares or reductions of registered share capital for distribution to shareholders if any must be approved by our shareholders in exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends or distributions be approved our board of directors will consider our results of operations cash requirements and surplus financial condition statutory requirements of applicable law contractual restrictions and other factors that they may deem relevant 

during fiscal 2016 our board of directors authorized an increase of 10 billion in the share repurchase program we repurchased approximately 43 million of our common shares for 2610 million 18 million of our common shares for 1163 million and 11 million of our common shares for 604 million under the share repurchase program during fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively at fiscal year end 2016 we had 11 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization 

commitments and contingencies 

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable leases and other obligations at fiscal year end 2016 



1 debt represents principal payments see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt 

2 interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps 3 purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services 4 the table above does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of 490 million and related accrued interest and penalties of 54 million the timing of which is uncertain see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits interest and penalties 5 the table above does not reflect pension obligations to certain employees and former employees we are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans however we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type including timing interest rate charges investment performance and amounts of benefit payments we expect to contribute 54 million to pension plans in fiscal 2017 before consideration of voluntary contributions these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 6 other longterm liabilities of 362 million are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items 

legal proceedings 

in the normal course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including patent infringement claims product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in certain instances we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2017 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

at fiscal year end 2016 we had outstanding letters of credit letters of guarantee and surety bonds of 324 million 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance in the opinion of management such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are considered to be the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

revenue recognition 

our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 605 revenue recognition  our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer this generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies a reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and also is recorded as a reduction of sales 

contract revenues for construction related projects which are generated in the communications solutions segment are recorded primarily using the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete percentageofcompletion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable in addition provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

intangible assets include both indeterminablelived residual goodwill and determinablelived identifiable intangible assets intangible assets with a determinable life primarily include intellectual property consisting of patents trademarks and unpatented technology as well as customer relationships recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straightline basis an evaluation of the remaining useful life of determinablelived intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation 

we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management at fiscal year end 2016 we had six reporting units five of which contained goodwill there were two reporting units in each of our three segments when changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values we review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test or more frequently based on changes in our structure 

goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred in assessing the existence of a triggering event management relies on a number of reporting unitspecific factors including operating results 

business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis 

when testing for goodwill impairment we perform a step i goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill may be impaired and a step ii goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment if any in the step ii goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 

fair value estimates used in the step i goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit the income approach generally has been supported by guideline analyses a market approach these approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates discount rates income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and determined that no impairment existed 

income taxes 

in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and nonus pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 income taxes  we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

pension 

our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions the funded status of our plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date the projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels the fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds held for the sole benefit of participants which are invested by the trustee of the funds the benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors such as years of service and compensation 

net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants 

two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and employee turnover these assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations at fiscal year end 2016 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by 127 million a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by 113 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets would have increased or decreased respectively our fiscal 2016 pension expense by 10 million 

the longterm target asset allocation in our us plans master trust is 10 equity and 90 fixed income asset reallocation to meet that target is occurring over a multiyear period based on the funded status as defined by the pension protection act of 2006 the pension act funded status of the us plans master trust and market conditions we expect to reach our target allocation when the pension act funded status exceeds 105 based on the pension act funded status as of fiscal year end 2016 our target asset allocation is 45 equity and 55 fixed income

nongaap financial measures 

organic net sales growth and free cash flow are nongaap measures and should not be considered replacements for results in accordance with gaap these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures reported by other companies the primary limitation of these measures is that they exclude the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results this limitation is best addressed by using these nongaap measures in combination with the most directly comparable gaap measures in order to better understand the amounts character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts the following provides additional information regarding these nongaap measures 

organic net sales growth 

organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our underlying results and trends in the business it is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans the difference between reported net sales growth the most comparable gaap measure and organic net sales growth consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures if any organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under managements control such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company such as acquisition and divestiture activity management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance also management uses organic net sales growth together with gaap measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations the tables presented in results of operations and segment results above provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under gaap 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash the difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities the most comparable gaap measure and free cash flow consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify we believe free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations 

free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items if any minus net capital expenditures voluntary pension contributions are excluded because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity certain special items including net payments related to preseparation tax matters are also excluded by management in evaluating free cash flow net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment these items are subtracted because they represent longterm commitments 

in the calculation of free cash flow we subtract certain cash items that are ultimately within managements and the board of directors discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable gaap measure indicates it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures as our 

definition of free cash flow does not consider certain nondiscretionary expenditures such as debt payments in addition we may have other discretionary expenditures such as discretionary dividends share repurchases and business acquisitions that are not considered in the calculation of free cash flow 

the tables presented in liquidity and capital resources above provide reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from continuing operating activities calculated under gaap

the following and other risks which are described in greater detail in part i item 1a risk factors as well as other risks described in this annual report could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements 

• conditions in the global or regional economies and global capital markets and cyclical industry conditions including as a result of the impact of the proposed exit of the united kingdom from the eu • conditions affecting demand for products in the industries we serve particularly the automotive industry • competition and pricing pressure • market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations and product life cycles • raw material availability quality and cost • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates • financial condition and consolidation of customers and vendors • reliance on thirdparty suppliers • risks associated with current and future acquisitions and divestitures • global risks of business interruptions such as natural disasters and political economic and military instability • risks associated with security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure 48 

• risks related to compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations • our ability to protect our intellectual property rights • risks of litigation • our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by our debt instruments • the possible effects on us of various us and nonus legislative proposals and other initiatives that if adopted could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate and negatively impact our us government contracts business • various risks associated with being a swiss corporation • the impact of fluctuations in the market price of our shares and • the impact of certain provisions of our articles of association on unsolicited takeover proposals there may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks 

we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an aa2 credit rating there is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty 

foreign currency exposures 

as part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we utilize crosscurrency swap contracts foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency swap contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts foreign currency forward contracts or foreign currency swap contracts from the fiscal year end 2016 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 112 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts foreign currency forward contracts or foreign currency swap contracts from the fiscal year end 2015 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 109 million such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the losses or gains on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions 

interest rate and investment exposures 

we issue debt as needed to fund our operations and capital requirements such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure to manage the interest rate exposure we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixedrate debt into variablerate debt we use forward starting interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the 

anticipated issuance of fixedrate debt we also utilize investment swaps to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities 

based on our floating rate debt balances of approximately 300 million at fiscal year end 2016 and 800 million at fiscal year end 2015 an increase in the levels of the us dollar interest rates by 05 with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately 2 million and 4 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively 

commodity exposures 

our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges we continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts in order to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period at fiscal year end 2016 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net gain position of 11 million and had a notional value of 232 million at fiscal year end 2015 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net loss position of 33 million and had a notional value of 260 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the fiscal year end 2016 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 24 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the fiscal year end 2015 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 23 million

1 net sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale 2 the americas includes our subsea communications business 

there is no single customer that accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2015 2014 or 2013 

sales marketing and distribution 

we sell our products into approximately 150 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers we also sell some of our products indirectly via thirdparty distributors in fiscal 2015 our direct sales represented 80 of net sales 

we maintain distribution centers around the world products are generally delivered to these distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer in some instances product is delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer we contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products via road rail sea and air 

seasonality and backlog 

we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business overall the third fiscal quarter is typically the strongest quarter of our fiscal year whereas the first and fourth fiscal quarters are negatively affected by winter holidays and european holidays respectively the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets 

certain of our end markets experience some seasonality our sales into the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production and seasonal declines in european production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter also our sales into the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases 

customer orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business conditions and cancellation of unfilled orders prior to shipment of goods backlog by reportable segment was as follows 



1 includes our subsea communications business backlog of 995 million and 774 million at fiscal year end 2015 and 2014 respectively 

we expect that the majority of our backlog at september 25 2015 will be filled during fiscal 2016 

competition 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers competition is generally on the basis of breadth of product offering product innovation price quality delivery and service our markets have generally been growing but with downward pressure on prices the following is a listing of our major competitors by segment 

• transportation solutions this segments major competitors include yazaki delphi sumitomo sensata honeywell molex and amphenol • industrial solutions this segment competes primarily against amphenol esterline molex belden phoenix contact hubbell and carlisle companies • communications solutions this segments major competitors include amphenol molex fci electronics jst korea electric terminal ket and bourns also the subsea communications business competes against alcatellucent and nec raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products the principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding precious metals such as gold and silver for plating and other metals such as copper aluminum brass and steel for manufacturing cable contacts and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers the prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas where we may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition 

our research and development expense was as follows 



intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including patents and patent applications as available in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical optical and electronic products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks 

while we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents 

employees 

as of september 25 2015 we employed approximately 72000 people worldwide of whom 22000 were in the americas region 25000 were in the asia–pacific region and 25000 were in the emea region of our total employees approximately 45000 were employed in manufacturing 

government regulation and supervision 

the import and export of products are subject to regulation by the united states us and other countries a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events we have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction 

environmental 

our operations are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment greenhouse gas emissions hazardous materials in products and chemical usage we are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment we maintain a global environmental health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards staff dedicated to 

environmental health and safety issues periodic compliance auditing training and other measures we also have a program for compliance with the european union eu restriction of hazardous substances and waste electrical and electronics equipment directives the china restriction of hazardous substances law the eu registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach regulation and similar laws 

compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future for example laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection management and reporting and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products we also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations based upon our experience current information and applicable laws we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of 16 million to 38 million and that the best estimate within this range is 19 million we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions 

corporate history

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business also is subject to general risks that affect many other companies additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations financial condition and liquidity 

risks relating to our business 

  conditions in global or regional economies capital and money markets and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit end demand from consumer and industrial markets and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults any of which could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow and ability to obtain financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full further our vendors may experience similar problems which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels if regional or global economic conditions deteriorate our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected also deterioration in economic conditions could trigger the recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other longlived assets impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position 

  we are dependent on the automotive and other industries 

we are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets periodic downturns in our customers industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

approximately 39 of our net sales for fiscal 2015 were to customers in the automotive industry the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers additionally the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions as a supplier of automotive electronics products our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic and credit conditions and changes in the operations products business models partsourcing requirements financial condition and market share of automotive manufacturers as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers 

during fiscal 2015 approximately 11 of our net sales were to customers in the data and devices end market 11 of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market and 9 of our net sales were to customers in the aerospace defense oil and gas end market the data and devices industry can experience variability in demand depending on the underlying business and consumer demand for computer and consumer electronics products as well as the market share of our customers demand for industrial equipment is dependent upon economic conditions the aerospace and defense industry has undergone significant fluctuations in demand depending on worldwide economic and political conditions demand in the oil and gas market is impacted by oil price volatility 

  we encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry 

we operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology our ability to participate in emerging markets and customers expectations relating to socially responsible operations the competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large diversified manufacturers to small highly specialized manufacturers the electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities a number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products we cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue 

substantially all of the markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences which are rapid in certain end markets our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design develop introduce and sell new and innovative products to modify existing products and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change there are numerous risks inherent in these processes including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands 

  like other suppliers to the electronics industry we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices 

we have historically experienced and we expect to continue to experience continuing pressure to lower our prices in recent years we have experienced price erosion averaging from 1 to 2 each year in order to maintain our margins we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts we cannot provide assurance that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our results are sensitive to raw material availability quality and cost 

we are a large buyer of resin copper gold silver brass steel chemicals and additives zinc and other precious metals many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers in addition the price of many of these raw materials including gold and copper continues to fluctuate our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if we have 

difficulty obtaining these raw materials the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are significant price increases for these raw materials any of these events could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials and to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers our margins may decline materially affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices the success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials we could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate 

in accordance with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use tin tantalum tungsten or gold conflict minerals or 3tg mined from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries together with the drc the covered countries in their products these requirements which were effective for the calendar year beginning january 1 2013 could affect the sourcing pricing and availability of 3tg used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who can demonstrate that they do not source any 3tg from the covered countries and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain nonconflict 3tg in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures 

  foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the us and changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue approximately 52 of our net sales for fiscal 2015 were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect nonus dollar revenue to represent a significant and likely increased portion of our future net revenue we have elected not to hedge this foreign currency exposure therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro or asian currencies our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease 

we manage certain cash intercompany and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts in addition to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to these contracts our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful 

  we may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate 

many of the industries to which we sell our products as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials have become more concentrated in recent years including the automotive computer and aerospace and defense industries consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us in addition as our customers buy in larger volumes their volume buying power has increased enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing these trends may adversely affect the profit margins on our products particularly for commodity components 

  the life cycles of our products can be very short 

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle as a result the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment if we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  future acquisitions may not be successful 

we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings we cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future we also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity 

if we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements this acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to make an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares 

  our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain executive management employees and limitations affecting retention and hiring including swiss regulations could have a negative impact on our business and increase our expenses 

our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our executive management employees and hire new executive management employees to replace succeed or add to members of our executive management team our executive management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for executive talent is intense and we compete for these personnel with other companies that are regulated by the laws of jurisdictions that provide significantly greater flexibility than switzerland our jurisdiction of incorporation in compensation practices for executive management employees 

  we could suffer significant business interruptions 

our operations and those of our suppliers and customers and the supply chains that support their operations may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis typhoons or floods or other disasters such as fires explosions acts of terrorism or war disease or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

  we may use components and products manufactured by third parties 

we may rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we may rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if these third parties fail to deliver quality products parts and components on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

  our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology 

the electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights within this industry companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights depending on the importance of the technology product patent trademark or trade secret in question an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise confidential information and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise information belonging to us our employees customers and suppliers and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation in the ordinary course of business we rely on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally we collect and store certain data including proprietary business information and customer and employee data and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our cybersecurity measures including employee and thirdparty training monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems which are continuously reviewed and upgraded our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in operations and damage to our reputation which could materially adversely affect our business while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure to date none of these threats has had a material impact on our business or operations 

  a decline in the market value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

concerns about deterioration in the global economy together with concerns about credit inflation or deflation have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities including fixed income and equity securities which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans investment portfolios in addition the expected returns on plan assets may not be 

achieved a decrease in the value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding 

the global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit recent downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital as a result we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures the extent of any impact will depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions 

  divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered 

  if any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations our business may suffer 

our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the us and the eu these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we may also be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable if we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements whether at all or in material part our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected further any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are subject to global risks of political economic and military instability 

our workforce manufacturing research administrative and sales facilities markets customers and suppliers are located throughout the world as a result we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including 

• tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes • regulations related to customs and importexport matters 15 

• variations in lengths of payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable • tax law and regulatory changes in the us and eu among other jurisdictions including tax law and regulatory changes that may be effected as a result of tax policy recommendations from quasigovernmental organizations such as the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd examinations by taxing authorities variations in tax laws from country to country changes to the terms of income tax treaties and difficulties in the taxefficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions • employment regulations and local labor conditions including increases in employment costs particularly in lowcost regions in which we currently operate • difficulties protecting intellectual property • instability in economic or political conditions including sovereign debt levels eurozone uncertainty inflation recession and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts and • the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements we have sizeable operations in china including 14 manufacturing sites in addition approximately 18 of our net sales in fiscal 2015 were made to customers in china economic conditions in china have been and may continue to be volatile and uncertain in addition the legal system in china is still developing and is subject to change accordingly our operations and orders for products in china could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions or interpretation of chinese law 

in addition any downgrade by rating agencies of longterm us sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions which could negatively affect our business financial condition and liquidity 

  we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdoms bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdoms bribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance program we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation government enforcement actions and reputational risk 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate these laws and regulations govern among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials • emissions or discharges of substances into the environment • investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites • greenhouse gas emissions 16 

• product hazardous material content and • the health and safety of our employees we may not have been or we may not at all times be in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators in addition environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigation removal and remediation costs under certain federal and state laws is retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and similar environmental agencies that conditions at a number of formerlyowned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites we also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation andor remediation is necessary 

while we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

  our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage hazardous material content and recycling 

the eu china and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal use of hazardous materials in products use of chemicals in manufacturing recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters these laws include the eu restriction of hazardous substances end of life vehicle and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the eu reach regulation the china law on management methods for controlling pollution by electronic information products and various other laws these laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes registration chemical testing labeling and other matters these laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale these laws could make manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions 

  we are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business we are a defendant in litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights anticompetitive behavior product liability breach of contract and employmentrelated claims in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert 

our managements attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our fiveyear unsecured senior revolving credit facility credit facility contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as defined in the credit facility and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens our outstanding notes indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate merge and sell assets 

although none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations our continued ability to meet the credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant a breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our credit facility if the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder 

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

risks relating to our separation from tyco international 

  we share responsibility for certain of our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date 

in connection with the separation from tyco international in 2007 we tyco international and covidien which on january 26 2015 was acquired and now operates as a subsidiary of medtronic plc entered into a tax sharing agreement under which we share responsibility for certain of our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of us income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our tyco internationals and covidiens us income tax returns certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation all costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties 

all of the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from tyco international became our tax liabilities although we have agreed to share 

certain of these tax liabilities with tyco international and covidien we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities if tyco international and covidien default on their obligations to us we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities 

if any party to the tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our tyco internationals and covidiens tax liabilities 

our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities in connection with such examinations tax authorities including the us internal revenue service irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments we are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments see additional information in income tax matters in part i item 3 legal proceedings amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that we have assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of accounting standards codification asc 740 income taxes  have been reflected as liabilities on the consolidated financial statements the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest 

under the tax sharing agreement tyco international has the right to administer control and settle all us income tax audits for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 the timing nature and amount of any settlement agreed to by tyco international may not be in our best interests moreover the other parties to the tax sharing agreement will be able to remove tyco international as the controlling party only under limited circumstances including a change of control or bankruptcy of tyco international or by a majority vote of the parties all other tax audits will be administered controlled and settled by the party that would be responsible for paying the tax 

risks relating to our swiss jurisdiction of incorporation 

  legislative and other proposals in switzerland the us and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

various us and nonus legislative proposals and other initiatives have been directed at multinational companies incorporated in lowertax jurisdictions there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives such as the organisation for economic cooperation and developments initiative to prevent base erosion and profit shifting which contemplates changes to numerous longstanding tax principles related to the distribution of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions although any recommendations made by the oecd are not themselves changes in tax law this guidance has resulted in unilateral action by several member countries and is also prompting possible amendment of other countries tax laws and regulations on a prospective and potentially a retroactive basis if these proposals are adopted in the main jurisdictions in which we do business they could among other things cause double taxation increase audit risk and materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate we cannot 

predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us 

  legislation in the us could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to us companies that have moved to lowertax jurisdictions 

we expect the us congress to continue to consider implementation andor expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad we cannot predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals therefore we cannot provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us in addition we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to us federal or state governments or the willingness of our nongovernmental customers to do business with us as a result of these uncertainties we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us 

  as a swiss corporation we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares 

as a swiss corporation our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements in addition our articles of association allow us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors but this authorization is limited to i authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years which authorization period ended on march 6 2015 and was not reapproved by our shareholders at our march 3 2015 annual meeting of shareholders and ii conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation dividends andor voting moreover under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convene a meeting of shareholders which would delay the timing to execute such actions such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management while we do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors 

  swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

we are organized under the laws of switzerland it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us and switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws would not be allowed in swiss courts as they are contrary to that nations public policy 

swiss corporate law which applies to us differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers thus holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

risks relating to our shares 

  the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors including 

• our quarterly or annual earnings • changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results • volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global and regional economic conditions and investors concerns about potential risks to future economic growth • changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates • changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles • announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions and • the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business   we might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

in order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of swiss withholding tax we anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes or registered share capital various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital or that swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our 

shareholders free from swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

under swiss corporate law the registered share capital in our unconsolidated swiss statutory financial statements is required to be denominated in swiss francs since distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in us dollars shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital and consequently are required to be stated in swiss francs if the us dollar were to increase in value relative to the swiss franc the us dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without swiss withholding tax will decrease 

  we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares 

the swiss code of obligations regulates a corporations ability to hold or repurchase its own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation additionally various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to repurchase our shares our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings 

our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by swiss law for swiss companies like us that issue registered shares as opposed to bearer shares this provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights holders of our shares must be registered in our share register aktienbuch as shareholders with voting rights only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders meetings but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends distributions preemptive rights advance subscription rights and liquidation proceeds the board of directors may in its discretion refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association additionally various proposals in switzerland for corporate law changes if passed in the future may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and banks such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable 

our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered antitakeover provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors under these provisions among others 

• shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent and • restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15 or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors these provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from conditional capital representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and if approved by shareholders may also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized capital representing a maximum of 50 of the shares or such lesser amount as may be approved by shareholders registered in the commercial register in each case without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders preemptive rights or advance subscription rights for the purpose of the defense of an actual threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid in relation to which the board of directors upon consultation with an independent financial advisor has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders we note that swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital in addition the nyse on which our shares are listed requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power with limited exceptions 







 item 2 properties 

properties 

our principal executive office is located in schaffhausen switzerland we operate nearly 400 manufacturing warehousing and office locations in over 50 countries and territories we own approximately 25 million square feet of space and lease approximately 10 million square feet of space our facilities are reasonably maintained and suitable for the operations conducted in them 

manufacturing 

we manufacture our products in over 20 countries worldwide our manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of the manufacturing processes including our primary processes of stamping plating molding extrusion beaming and assembly our principal centers of manufacturing output at september 25 2015 included sites in the following countries 



we estimate that our manufacturing production by region in fiscal 2015 was approximately americas—30 asia–pacific—30 and emea—40 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax in addition we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims at any given time in the ordinary course of business we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions if infringement of a third partys patent were to be determined against us we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products if a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge which could be significant in amount 

as previously reported we had a contingent purchase price commitment of 80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of comnet this represented the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of comnet only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the state of florida in accordance with guidelines set forth in the contract under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we did not believe we had any obligation to the sellers however the sellers contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in june 2006 in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania trial began in march 2015 and culminated in the entry of final judgment on october 8 2015 in favor of the sellers and against us for 127 million plus costs the judgment represents the 80 million contingent purchase price plus prejudgment interest which will continue to accrue until the judgment is paid in full we are proceeding with an appeal in connection with this case we recorded a reserve and pretax charges of 127 million in fiscal 2015 these charges are reflected in income from discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of operations as the comnet case was associated with our former wireless systems business which was sold in fiscal 2009 

management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows however the proceedings discussed below in income tax matters could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

income tax matters 

in october 2012 the irs issued special agreement forms 870ad effectively settling its audit of all tax matters for the years 1997 through 2000 excluding one issue that remains in dispute as described below the disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions the irs field examination asserted that certain intercompany loans originated during the years 1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for us federal income tax purposes and disallowed approximately 27 billion of related interest deductions recognized during the period on tyco internationals us income tax returns in addition if the irs is ultimately successful in asserting its claim it is likely to disallow an additional 66 billion of interest deductions reflected on us income tax returns in years subsequent to fiscal 2000 tyco international contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt for us income tax purposes and that the interest deductions reflected on the income tax returns were appropriate the irs and tyco international were unable to resolve this matter through the irs appeals process on june 20 2013 tyco international advised us that it had received notices of deficiency from the irs for certain former us subsidiaries of tyco international increasing taxable income by approximately 29 billion in connection with the audit of tyco internationals fiscal years 1997 through 2000 the notices of deficiency assert that tyco international 

owes additional taxes totaling 778 million associated penalties of 154 million and withholding taxes of 105 million in addition tyco international received final partnership administrative adjustments for certain us partnerships owned by former us subsidiaries with respect to which tyco international estimates an additional tax deficiency of approximately 30 million will be asserted the amounts asserted by the irs exclude any applicable deficiency interest and do not reflect any impact to subsequent period tax liabilities in the event that the irs were to prevail on some or all of its assertions we understand that tyco international strongly disagrees with the irs position and has filed petitions in the us tax court contesting the irss proposed adjustments tyco international has advised us that it believes there are meritorious defenses for the tax filings in question and that the irs position with regard to this matter is inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing us treasury regulations 

the previously set us tax court trial date of february 29 2016 has been delayed at the request of the irs and trial is expected to commence during october 2016 the parties remain engaged in discovery we do not expect any payments to the irs with respect to this matter until it is fully and finally resolved in accordance with the tax sharing agreement we tyco international and covidien would share 31 27 and 42 respectively of any payments made in connection with this matter 

if the irs were to prevail on its assertions our share of the assessed tax deficiency interest and applicable withholding taxes and penalties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows we have reviewed the notices of deficiency the relevant facts surrounding the intercompany debt transactions relevant tax regulations and applicable case law and we continue to believe that we are appropriately reserved for this matter

overview 

we are a global technology leader we design and manufacture connectivity and sensors solutions that are essential in todays increasingly connected world we help our customers solve the need for intelligent efficient and highperforming products and solutions 

during fiscal 2015 we reorganized our management structure and segments to better align the organization around our strategy we now operate through three reportable segments transportation solutions industrial solutions and communications solutions see notes 1 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our segments prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the current segment reporting structure 

fiscal 2015 highlights included the following 

• overall our net sales increased 22 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due to increased net sales in the transportation solutions and communications solutions segments partially offset by sales declines in the industrial solutions segment • on an organic basis net sales increased 38 during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 our organic net sales by segment were as follows • transportation solutions —our net sales increased 41 on an organic basis during fiscal 2015 due primarily to increases in the automotive end market • industrial solutions —our organic net sales were flat in fiscal 2015 • communications solutions —our organic net sales increased 84 in fiscal 2015 due primarily to sales increases in the subsea communications end market partially offset by declines in the data and devices end market • during fiscal 2015 our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of 132 per issued share payable in four quarterly installments of 033 beginning with the third fiscal quarter of 2015 and ending in the second fiscal quarter of 2016 • during fiscal 2015 we acquired measurement specialties and divested our bns business 31 

outlook 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we expect net sales to be between 27 billion and 29 billion this reflects sales decreases in all segments relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 is as follows 

• transportation solutions —we expect our sales declines in the automotive and commercial transportation end markets to be partially offset by sales growth in the sensors end market in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we expect global automotive production to decline 2 in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2015 • industrial solutions —we expect our sales to decrease during the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the slowdown in china inventory reductions in the supply chain and continued weakness in the oil and gas market • communications solutions —in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we expect our sales growth in the subsea communications end market to be more than offset by our sales declines in the data and devices and appliances end markets resulting from continued weakness in china inventory reductions in the supply chain and the exit of certain product lines we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 062 to 070 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 this outlook reflects continued market weakness in china also it reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately 167 million and 005 per share respectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 

for fiscal 2016 which will be 53 weeks in length we expect net sales to be between 120 billion and 128 billion primarily reflecting sales increases in the transportation solutions segment offset by sales declines in the communications solutions segment from fiscal 2015 levels additional information regarding expectations for our reportable segments for fiscal 2016 is as follows 

• transportation solutions —during fiscal 2016 we expect our sales to increase in the automotive end market while we expect global automotive production to be flat as compared to fiscal 2015 also we expect our sales growth in the sensors end market to be partially offset by sales declines in the commercial transportation end market in fiscal 2016 • industrial solutions —within the aerospace defense oil and gas end market we expect our sales growth primarily in the commercial aerospace market to be offset by sales declines in the oil and gas market due to continued market weakness in fiscal 2016 we anticipate that the negative impact of inventory adjustments in the supply chain will continue during the first half of fiscal 2016 • communications solutions —in fiscal 2016 we expect our sales growth in the subsea communications end market to be more than offset by our sales declines in the data and devices end market resulting from the exit of certain product lines and continued weakness in china we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 361 to 401 per share in fiscal 2016 this outlook includes approximately 200 million in net sales and 005 earnings per share resulting from the additional week in fiscal 2016 also this outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately 262 million and 010 per share respectively in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 

the above outlook is based on foreign exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels 

we are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment including the uncertain market conditions in china and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve additionally we continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions we are also 

managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources

the following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by segment 



net sales increased 260 million or 22 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 the increase in net sales resulted from sales contributions from acquisitions of 59 and organic sales growth of 38 partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 75 due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies measurement specialties contributed net sales of 548 million during fiscal 2015 

on an organic basis net sales increased 460 million or 38 in fiscal 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of sales increases in the transportation solutions and communications solutions segments price erosion adversely affected organic sales by 208 million in fiscal 2015 

net sales increased 583 million or 51 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the increase in net sales was primarily the result of organic growth of 49 and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 03 due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies 

on an organic basis net sales increased 557 million or 49 during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 as increased net sales in the transportation solutions segment and to a lesser degree the industrial solutions segment were partially offset by sales decreases in the communications solutions segment price erosion adversely affected organic sales by 194 million in fiscal 2014 

see further discussion of organic net sales below under segment results 

net sales by geographic region our business operates in three geographic regions—the americas asia–pacific and emea—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into us dollars at the end of each fiscal period we sell our products into approximately 150 countries and approximately 52 of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar in fiscal 2015 the percentage of net sales in fiscal 2015 by major currencies invoiced was as follows

in fiscal 2014 gross margin increased 321 million as compared to fiscal 2013 the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from improved manufacturing productivity and to a lesser degree higher volume partially offset by price erosion 

cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices and the price of many of our raw materials continues to fluctuate in fiscal 2015 we purchased approximately 160 million pounds of copper 123000 troy ounces of gold and 25 million troy ounces of silver the following table sets forth the average prices incurred related to copper gold and silver 



in fiscal 2016 we expect to purchase copper gold and silver in quantities similar 2015 levels 

operating expenses 

the following table presents operating expenses in dollars and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales as well as the changes from the prior fiscal year 



selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses decreased 30 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 the decrease resulted primarily from cost control measures and saving attributable to restructuring actions partially offset by additional expenses associated with measurement specialties 

in fiscal 2014 selling general and administrative expenses increased 94 million as compared to fiscal 2013 the increase resulted primarily from increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels partially offset by savings attributable to restructuring actions and a gain on the sale of real estate 

research development and engineering expenses research development and engineering expenses increased 44 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of additional expenses related to acquisitions and growth initiatives primarily in the transportation solutions segment 

acquisition and integration costs in fiscal 2015 we incurred acquisition and integration costs of 55 million related primarily to the acquisitions of measurement specialties and the seacon group seacon in fiscal 2014 we incurred acquisition and integration costs of 31 million primarily in connection with the acquisition of seacon in connection with the acquisition of deutsch we incurred acquisition and integration costs of 14 million during fiscal 2013 

restructuring and other charges net we are committed to continuous productivity improvements and consistently evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint migrate facilities to lowercost regions reduce fixed costs and eliminate excess capacity these initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry improve our operating leverage and position us for future growth during fiscal 2015 we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions and product line closures primarily impacting the communications solutions and industrial solutions segments during fiscal 2014 we initiated a restructuring program associated primarily with headcount reductions and manufacturing site and product line closures in the communications solutions segment during fiscal 2013 we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions and manufacturing site closures impacting all segments 

in connection with these initiatives we recorded net restructuring charges of 93 million 23 million and 225 million in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we expect to incur net restructuring charges of approximately 75 million during fiscal 2016 and we expect total spending which will be funded with cash from operations to be approximately 90 million in fiscal 2016 annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2015 are estimated to be approximately 

80 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2017 cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses 

during fiscal 2015 we incurred net other charges of 59 million primarily in connection with the divestiture of bns

nonoperating items 

the following table presents select nonoperating items as well as the changes from the prior fiscal year 



1 not meaningful 

interest expense the increase in interest expense of 9 million in fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014 was due to higher average debt levels the decrease of 12 million in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 was due to a lower average cost of debt 

other income expense net in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 we recorded net other income expense primarily pursuant to the tax sharing agreement with tyco international and covidien see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the tax sharing agreement 

net other expense in fiscal 2015 included 84 million related to the effective settlement of undisputed tax matters for the years 2001 through 2007 net other income in fiscal 2014 included 18 million of income related to our share of a settlement agreement entered into by tyco international with a former subsidiary cit group inc which arose from a preseparation claim for which we were entitled to 31 once resolved net other expense in fiscal 2013 included 231 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the years 1997 through 2000 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the effective settlement of undisputed tax matters 

income taxes the tax provision for fiscal 2015 reflects an income tax benefit of 264 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the years 2001 through 2010 partially offset by 216 million of income tax charges associated with the tax impacts of certain intercompany legal entity restructurings made in connection with our integration of measurement specialties also the tax provision for fiscal 2015 reflects an income tax charge of 29 million associated with the tax impacts of certain intercompany dividends related to the restructuring and sale of bns 

the tax provision for fiscal 2014 reflects income tax benefits of 282 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with certain adc tax loss carryforwards partially offset by an income tax charge related to adjustments to prior year income tax returns 

in fiscal 2014 we acquired seacon and its us operations were combined with our adc us federal consolidated tax group in addition the adc us tax group was combined with other us legal entities and assets we reassessed the realization of the revised adc us tax groups tax loss and credit carryforwards based upon managements review of forecasted future taxable income of the reorganized combined tax group we believed it was more likely than not that a tax benefit would be 

realized on additional us federal and state net operating losses accordingly we reduced the valuation allowance and recorded a tax benefit of 282 million 

the tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects an income tax benefit of 331 million related to the effective settlement of all undisputed tax matters for the years 1997 through 2000 in addition the tax benefit for fiscal 2013 reflects 23 million of net tax benefits consisting primarily of income tax benefits recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with certain adc tax loss carryforwards and income tax benefits recognized in connection with the lapse of statutes of limitations for examinations of prior year income tax returns partially offset by income tax expense related to adjustments to prior year income tax returns 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 3237 million and 1706 million at fiscal year end 2015 and 2014 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss capital loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions during fiscal 2015 the valuation allowance increased due primarily to tax losses of 1381 million tax effected generated in connection with the writedown of investments in subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions where future utilization is uncertain we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheet 

we have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries earnings that are expected to be distributed in the future no additional provision has been made for swiss or nonswiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested the investments are essentially permanent in duration or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings as of september 25 2015 certain subsidiaries had approximately 19 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations including working capital property plant and equipment intangible assets and research and development activities a liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed it is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries

• industrial equipment —our organic net sales were flat in fiscal 2015 as growth in the asia–pacific and emea regions was offset by lower demand in the americas region • aerospace defense oil and gas —our organic net sales decreased 15 in fiscal 2015 due primarily to weakness in the oil and gas market resulting from oil price declines and market uncertainty partially offset by continued strength in our commercial aviation business • energy —our organic net sales were flat in fiscal 2015 as growth in the americas region was offset by declines in the asia–pacific region net sales in the industrial solutions segment increased 202 million or 65 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of organic sales growth of 52 and the net sales impact from acquisitions and a divestiture of 10 our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows 

• industrial equipment —our organic net sales increased 60 in fiscal 2014 as a result of market recovery particularly in the asia–pacific region and to a lesser degree the emea region • aerospace defense oil and gas —our organic net sales increased 65 in fiscal 2014 the increase was attributable to continued strength in the commercial aviation business and growth in the oil and gas market partially offset by continued weakness in the defense market • energy —our organic net sales increased 21 in fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of growth in the asia–pacific and americas regions partially offset by a decline in the emea region operating income the following table presents the industrial solutions segments operating income and operating margin as well as the changes from the prior fiscal year 



the industrial solutions segments operating income included the following special items 



in fiscal 2015 operating income in the industrial solutions segment decreased 79 million as compared to fiscal 2014 excluding the charges presented in the table above operating income decreased in fiscal 2015 as a result of the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and price erosion partially offset by higher volume 

operating income in the industrial solutions segment increased 87 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 excluding the charges presented in the table above operating income increased in fiscal 2014 due to higher volume and improved manufacturing productivity partially offset by price erosion

the following table provides an analysis of the change in the communications solutions segments net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by primary industry end market 



net sales in the communications solutions segment increased 122 million or 47 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of organic sales growth of 84 partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 37 our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows 

• data and devices —our organic net sales decreased 136 in fiscal 2015 due to continued declines in our sales in the feature phone and tablet computer markets weak demand in the smartphone business and the exit of certain low margin product lines • subsea communications —our organic net sales increased 1505 in fiscal 2015 as a result of increased levels of project activity • appliances —our organic net sales increased 23 in fiscal 2015 with increased demand in the emea region and a rebound in the us market partially offset by lower demand in the asia–pacific region in fiscal 2014 net sales in the communications solutions segment decreased 224 million or 80 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to declines in organic sales of 62 sales declines resulting from a divestiture of 14 and the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 04 our organic net sales by primary industry end market were as follows 

• data and devices —our organic net sales decreased 55 in fiscal 2014 due to the exit of certain product lines and weak demand in the datacenter mobile phone and personal computer markets partially offset by increased demand and new product launches in the tablet computer market • subsea communications —our organic net sales decreased 287 in fiscal 2014 due to lower project volume • appliances —our organic net sales increased 63 in fiscal 2014 due primarily to increased demand and share gains in the asia–pacific region and to a lesser degree the americas region operating income the following table presents the communications solutions segments operating income and operating margin as well as the changes from the prior fiscal year

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows 



our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets money markets or other sources of funding as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements we believe that cash generated from operations and to the extent necessary these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future including the payment of 500 million of senior floating rate notes due in january 2016 we may use excess cash to reduce our outstanding debt including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program to pay distributions or dividends on our common shares or to acquire strategic businesses or product lines the cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions we will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions 

as of september 25 2015 our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world under current applicable laws substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to tyco electronics group sa tegsa our luxembourg subsidiary which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt and to te connectivity ltd our swiss parent company however the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax costs we provide for tax liabilities on the consolidated financial statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations as of september 25 2015 we had approximately 52 billion of cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits principally in our subsidiaries that we have the ability to distribute to tegsa our luxembourg subsidiary and te connectivity ltd our swiss parent company but we consider to be permanently reinvested we estimate that up to approximately 17 billion of tax expense would be recognized on the consolidated financial statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations including investing and financing activities 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities decreased 185 million to 1619 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to 1804 million in fiscal 2014 the decrease resulted primarily from the unfavorable effects of changes in working capital levels partially offset by a decrease in net payments made in relation to preseparation tax matters 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 1804 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to 1775 million in fiscal 2013 the increase resulted primarily from higher income levels partially 

offset by higher accounts receivable levels and net payments made in relation to preseparation tax matters 

pension and postretirement benefit contributions in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 were 68 million 89 million and 95 million respectively we expect pension and postretirement benefit contributions to be 75 million in fiscal 2016 before consideration of any voluntary contributions there were no voluntary pension contributions in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 

the amount of income taxes paid net of refunds during fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 was 350 million 259 million and 299 million respectively in fiscal 2015 and 2013 these payments included 47 million and 67 million respectively for tax deficiencies related to preseparation tax matters also during fiscal 2015 and 2013 we received net reimbursements of 7 million and 39 million respectively from tyco international and covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for preseparation us tax matters during fiscal 2014 we made net payments of 179 million to tyco international and covidien pursuant to our indemnifications for preseparations us tax matters see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to preseparation tax matters 

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities we use free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as a useful measure of our ability to generate cash free cash flow was 1076 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to 1477 million in fiscal 2014 and 1244 million in fiscal 2013 the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities the most comparable gaap financial measure to free cash flow 



cash flows from investing activities 

capital expenditures were 600 million 635 million and 581 million in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we expect fiscal 2016 capital spending levels to be approximately 5 of net sales we believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities 

proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment for fiscal 2014 included approximately 100 million related to the sale of real estate 

during fiscal 2015 we acquired measurement specialties the total value paid for the transaction was approximately 17 billion net of cash acquired and included 225 million for the repayment of measurement specialties debt and accrued interest also during fiscal 2015 we acquired three additional companies for 241 million in cash net of cash acquired during fiscal 2014 we acquired five companies for 522 million in cash net of cash acquired see additional information in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

during fiscal 2015 we received net cash proceeds of 30 billion related to the sale of our bns business see additional information in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

cash flows from financing activities and capitalization 

total debt at fiscal year end 2015 and 2014 was 3903 million and 3858 million respectively see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt 

during february 2015 tegsa our 100owned subsidiary repaid at maturity 250 million of 160 senior notes due 2015 

in february 2015 tegsa issued €550 million aggregate principal amount of 1100 senior notes due march 1 2023 the notes are tegsas unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of tegsa and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that tegsa may incur 

tegsa has a fiveyear unsecured senior revolving credit facility credit facility with total commitments of 1500 million the credit facility was amended in august 2013 primarily to extend the maturity date from june 2016 to august 2018 and reduce borrowing costs tegsa had no borrowings under the credit facility at september 25 2015 and september 26 2014 

the credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if as of the last day of each fiscal quarter our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 375 to 10 an event of default as defined in the credit facility is triggered the credit facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants none of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations as of september 25 2015 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future 

periodically tegsa issues commercial paper to us institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the credit facility 

tegsas payment obligations under its senior notes commercial paper and credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent te connectivity ltd 

payments of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders were 502 million 443 million and 384 million in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding dividends and cash distributions on our common shares 

future dividends on our common shares or reductions of registered share capital for distribution to shareholders if any must be approved by our shareholders in exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends or distributions be approved our board of directors will consider our results of operations cash requirements and surplus financial condition statutory requirements of applicable law contractual restrictions and other factors that they may deem relevant 

during fiscal 2015 our board of directors authorized an increase of 30 billion in the share repurchase program we repurchased approximately 18 million of our common shares for 1163 million approximately 11 million of our common shares for 604 million and approximately 20 million of our common shares for 829 million during fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively at september 25 2015 we had 27 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization 

commitments and contingencies 

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable leases and other obligations at fiscal year end 2015 



1 interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps 2 purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services 3 the table above does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of 1368 million and related accrued interest and penalties of 1076 million the timing of which is uncertain see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits interest and penalties 4 the table above does not reflect pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees we are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans however we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type including timing interest rate charges investment performance and amounts of benefit payments we expect to contribute 75 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2016 before consideration of voluntary contributions these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 5 other longterm liabilities of 433 million are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items 

legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including patent infringement claims product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows however the proceedings discussed below in income tax matters could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows see part i item 3 legal proceedings for further information regarding legal proceedings 

as previously reported we had a contingent purchase price commitment of 80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of comnet this represented the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of comnet only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the state of florida in accordance with guidelines set forth in the contract under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we did not believe we had any obligation to the sellers however the sellers contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in june 2006 in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania trial began in march 2015 and culminated in the entry of final judgment on october 8 2015 in favor of the sellers and against us for 127 million plus costs the judgment represents the 80 million contingent purchase price plus 

prejudgment interest which will continue to accrue until the judgment is paid in full we are proceeding with an appeal in connection with this case we recorded a reserve and pretax charges of 127 million in fiscal 2015 these charges are reflected in income from discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of operations as the comnet case was associated with our former wireless systems business which was sold in fiscal 2009 

income tax matters 

in connection with the separation from tyco international in 2007 we entered into a tax sharing agreement that generally governs our tyco internationals and covidiens respective rights responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the tax sharing agreement pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and covidien see income tax matters in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income tax matters including the disputed issue related to the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in certain instances we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2016 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

at september 25 2015 we had outstanding letters of credit letters of guarantee and surety bonds in the amount of 360 million 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance in the opinion of management such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are considered to be the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

revenue recognition 

our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with asc 605 revenue recognition  our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer this generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies a reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and also is recorded as a reduction of sales 

contract revenues for construction related projects which are generated in the communications solutions segment are recorded primarily using the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete percentageofcompletion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable in addition provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

intangible assets include both indeterminablelived residual goodwill and determinablelived identifiable intangible assets intangible assets with a determinable life primarily include intellectual property consisting of patents trademarks and unpatented technology as well as customer relationships recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straightline basis an evaluation of the remaining useful life of determinablelived intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation 

we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management at fiscal year end 2015 we had seven reporting units six of which contained goodwill there are two reporting units in each of the transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments and three reporting units in the communications solutions segment when changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values we review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test or more frequently based on changes in our structure 

goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred in assessing the existence of a triggering event management relies on a number of reportingunitspecific factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis 

when testing for goodwill impairment we perform a step i goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill may be impaired and a step ii goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment if any in the step ii goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied 

fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 

fair value estimates used in the step i goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit the income approach generally has been supported by guideline analyses a market approach these approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates discount rates income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and determined that no impairment existed 

income taxes 

in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and nonus pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings any changes in a valuation allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition will be reflected in the income tax provision 

changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 income taxes  we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due in addition management reviews with tax counsel various issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of recorded amounts these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the 

impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

pension and postretirement benefits 

our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions the funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date for defined benefit pension plans the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels for the postretirement benefit plans the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered the fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds held for the sole benefit of participants which are invested by the trustee of the funds the benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors such as years of service and compensation 

net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants 

two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and employee turnover these assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations at fiscal year end 2015 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by 136 million a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by 122 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets would have increased or decreased respectively our fiscal 2015 pension expense by 11 million 

the longterm target asset allocation in our us plans master trust is 10 equity and 90 fixed income asset reallocation to meet that target is occurring over a multiyear period based on the funded status as defined by the pension protection act of 2006 the pension act funded status of the us plans master trust and market conditions we expect to reach our target allocation when the pension act funded status exceeds 105 based on the pension act funded status as of september 25 2015 our target asset allocation is 45 equity and 55 fixed income

nongaap financial measures 

organic net sales growth and free cash flow are nongaap measures and should not be considered replacements for results in accordance with gaap these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures reported by other companies the primary limitation of these measures is that they exclude the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results this limitation is best addressed by using these nongaap measures in combination with the most directly comparable gaap measures in order to better understand the amounts character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts the following provides additional information regarding these nongaap measures 

organic net sales growth 

organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our underlying results and trends in the business it is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans the difference between reported net sales growth the most comparable gaap measure and organic net sales growth consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures if any organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under managements control such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company such as acquisition and divestiture activity management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance also management uses organic net sales growth together with gaap measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations the tables presented in results of operations and segment results above provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under gaap 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash the difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities the most comparable gaap measure and free cash flow consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify we believe free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations 

free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items if any minus net capital expenditures net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment these items are subtracted because they represent longterm commitments voluntary pension contributions are excluded because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity certain special items including net payments related to preseparation tax matters are also considered by management in evaluating free cash flow we believe investors also should consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow 

free cash flow subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within managements and the board of directors discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable gaap measure indicates it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures as our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain nondiscretionary expenditures such as debt payments in addition we may have other discretionary expenditures such as discretionary dividends share repurchases and business acquisitions that are not considered in the calculation of free cash flow 

the tables presented in liquidity and capital resources above provide reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from continuing operating activities calculated under gaap

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks 

we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an aa2 credit rating there is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty 

foreign currency exposures 

as part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we utilize crosscurrency swap contracts foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency swap contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our crosscurrency swap contracts foreign currency forward contracts or foreign currency swap contracts from the september 25 2015 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 109 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our foreign currency forward or swap contracts from the september 26 2014 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 16 million such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions 

interest rate and investment exposures 

we issue debt as needed to fund our operations and capital requirements such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure to manage the interest rate exposure we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixedrate debt into variablerate debt we use forward starting interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixedrate debt we also utilize investment swaps to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities 

based on our floating rate debt balances of approximately 800 million at september 25 2015 and 950 million at september 26 2014 an increase in the levels of the us dollar interest rates by 05 with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately 4 million and 5 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively 

commodity exposures 

our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges we continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts in order to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period at september 25 2015 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net loss position of 33 million and had a notional value of 260 million at september 26 2014 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net loss position of 21 million and had a notional value of 307 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the september 25 2015 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 23 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the september 26 2014 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 29 million

competition 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers competition is generally on the basis of breadth of product offering product innovation price quality delivery and service our markets have generally been growing but with downward pressure on prices the following is a listing of our major competitors by segment 

• transportation solutions this segment competes primarily against yazaki delphi sumitomo sensata continental ag molex and amphenol 7 

• industrial solutions this segment competes primarily against amphenol esterline molex phoenix contact hubbell and 3m • network solutions this segments major competitors include commscope corning huawei technologies amphenol and molex also the subsea communications business competes against alcatellucent • consumer solutions this segments major competitors include molex jst connectors japan aviation electronics amphenol and foxconn technology group raw materials

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas where we may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition 

our research and development expense was as follows 



intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including patents and patent applications as available in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical optical and electronic products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks 

while we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents 

employees 

as of september 26 2014 we employed approximately 83000 people worldwide of whom 28000 were in the emea region 28000 were in the asia–pacific region and 27000 were in the americas region of our total employees approximately 53000 were employed in manufacturing 

government regulation and supervision 

the import and export of products are subject to regulation by the united states us and other countries a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events we have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction 

environmental 

our operations are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment greenhouse gas emissions hazardous materials in products chemical usage and others we are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment we maintain a global environmental health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards staff dedicated to environmental health and safety issues periodic compliance auditing training and other measures we have a program for compliance with the european union eu restriction of hazardous substances and waste electrical and electronics equipment directives the china restriction of hazardous substances law the eu reach chemical registration and evaluation regulation and similar laws 

compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future for example laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection management and reporting and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products we also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations based upon our experience current information and applicable laws we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 18 million to 40 million as of september 26 2014 we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately 21 million we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions 

corporate history 

we are organized under the laws of switzerland the rights of holders of our shares are governed by swiss law our swiss articles of association and our swiss organizational regulations 

our business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions from fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2002 of established electronics companies and divisions including amp incorporated raychem corporation the electromechanical components division of siemens and the oem division of thomas  betts these companies each had more than 50 years of history in engineering and innovation excellence we operated as a segment of tyco international ltd tyco international prior to our separation

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business also is subject to risks that affect many other companies such as general economic conditions geopolitical events competition technological obsolescence labor relations natural disasters and international operations additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations financial condition and liquidity 

risks relating to our business 

  conditions in global or regional economies capital and money markets and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit end demand from consumer and industrial markets and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults any of which could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow and ability to obtain financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full further 

our vendors may experience similar problems which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels if regional or global economic conditions deteriorate our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected also deterioration in economic conditions could trigger the recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other longlived assets impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position 

  we are dependent on the automotive and other industries 

we are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets periodic downturns in our customers industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

approximately 44 of our net sales for fiscal 2014 were to customers in the automotive industry the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers additionally the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions as a supplier of automotive electronics products our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic and credit conditions and changes in the operations products business models partsourcing requirements financial condition and market share of automotive manufacturers as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers 

during fiscal 2014 approximately 10 9 8 and 7 of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment telecom networks aerospace defense oil and gas and consumer devices end markets respectively demand for industrial equipment is dependent upon economic conditions the telecom networks industry has historically experienced fluctuations in demand resulting from changes in carrier activity and capital investments by customers the aerospace and defense industry has undergone significant fluctuations in demand depending on worldwide economic and political conditions the consumer devices industry can experience variability in demand depending on the underlying business and consumer demand for computer and consumer electronics products as well as the market share of our customers 

  we encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry 

we operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology our ability to participate in emerging markets and customers expectations relating to socially responsible operations the competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large diversified manufacturers to small highly specialized manufacturers the electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities a number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products we cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue 

substantially all of the markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences which are rapid in certain end markets our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design develop introduce and sell new and innovative products to modify existing products and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change there are numerous risks inherent in these processes including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands 

  like other suppliers to the electronics industry we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices 

we have historically experienced and we expect to continue to experience continuing pressure to lower our prices in recent years we have experienced price erosion averaging from 1 to 2 each year in order to maintain our margins we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts we cannot assure you that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our results are sensitive to raw material availability quality and cost 

we are a large buyer of resin copper gold silver brass steel chemicals and additives zinc and other precious metals many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers in addition the price of many of these raw materials including gold and copper has increased in recent years and continues to fluctuate in recent years we have only been able to partially offset these increases through higher selling prices our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are continued significant price increases for these raw materials any of these events could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials and to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers our margins may decline materially affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices the success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials we could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries together with the drc the covered countries as a result the sec established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use tin tantalum tungsten or gold conflict minerals or 3tg mined from the covered countries in their products these requirements were effective for the calendar year beginning january 1 2013 these requirements could affect the sourcing pricing and availability of 3tg used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who can demonstrate that they do not source any 3tg from the covered countries and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain nonconflict 3tg in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we are implementing 

  foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue approximately 55 of our net sales for fiscal 2014 were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect nonus dollar revenue to represent a significant and likely increased portion of our future net revenue we do not hedge this nonus dollar foreign currency risk therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro or asian currencies our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage certain intercompany and other foreign exchange risks in part by entering into financial derivative contracts in addition to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to these contracts our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful 

  we may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate 

many of the industries to which we sell our products as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials have become more concentrated in recent years including the automotive telecommunications computer and aerospace and defense industries consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us in addition as our customers buy in larger volumes their volume buying power has increased enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing these trends may adversely affect the profit margins on our products particularly for commodity components 

  the life cycles of our products can be very short 

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle as a result the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment if we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  future acquisitions may not be successful 

we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings we cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future we also cannot assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity 

if we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements this acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot assure you that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to make an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares 

  our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain executive management employees and limitations affecting retention and hiring including swiss regulations could have a negative impact on our business and increase our expenses 

our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our executive management employees and hire new executive management employees to replace succeed or add to members of our executive management team our executive management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for executive talent is intense and we compete for these personnel with other companies that are regulated by the laws of jurisdictions that provide significantly greater flexibility than switzerland our jurisdiction of incorporation in compensation practices for executive management employees 

  we could suffer significant business interruptions 

our operations and those of our suppliers and customers and the supply chains that support their operations may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis typhoons or floods or other disasters such as fires explosions acts of terrorism or war disease or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  we may use components and products manufactured by third parties 

we may rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we may rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if these third parties fail to deliver quality products parts and components on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

  our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology 

the electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights within this industry companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights depending on the importance of the technology product patent trademark or trade secret in question an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise confidential information and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise information belonging to us our employees customers and suppliers and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation in the ordinary course of business we rely on information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities additionally we collect and store certain data 

including proprietary business information and customer and employee data and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our cybersecurity measures including employee and thirdparty training monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems which are continuously reviewed and upgraded our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or penalties under privacy laws disruption in operations and damage to our reputation which could materially adversely affect our business 

  a decline in the market value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

concerns about deterioration in the global economy together with concerns about credit inflation or deflation have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities including fixed income and equity securities which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans investment portfolios in addition the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved a decrease in the value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding 

the global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit recent downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital as a result we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures the extent of any impact will depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions 

  divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered 

  if any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations our business may suffer 

our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the us and the eu these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial agreements and practices 

with respect to the electrical components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we also may be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable if we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements whether at all or in material part our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected further any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are subject to global risks of political economic and military instability 

our workforce manufacturing research administrative and sales facilities markets customers and suppliers are located throughout the world as a result we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including 

• tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes • regulations related to customs and importexport matters • variations in lengths of payment cycles • tax issues such as tax law and regulatory changes including tax law and regulatory changes that may be effected as a result of tax policy recommendations from quasigovernmental organizations such as the organization for economic development examinations by taxing authorities variations in tax laws from country to country and difficulties in the taxefficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions • challenges in collecting accounts receivable • employment regulations and local labor conditions including increases in employment costs particularly in lowcost regions in which we currently operate • difficulties protecting intellectual property • instability in economic or political conditions including sovereign debt levels eurozone uncertainty inflation recession and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts and • the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements we have sizeable operations in china including 15 manufacturing sites in addition approximately 16 of our net sales in fiscal 2014 were made to customers in china the legal system in china is still developing and is subject to change accordingly our operations and orders for products in china could be adversely affected by changes to or interpretation of chinese law 

in addition any downgrade by rating agencies of longterm us sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions which could negatively affect our business financial condition and liquidity 

  we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk antibribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk antibribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance 

with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance program we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation government enforcement actions and reputational risk 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate these laws and regulations govern among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials • emissions or discharges of substances into the environment • investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites • greenhouse gas emissions • product hazardous material content and • the health and safety of our employees we may not have been or we may not at all times be in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators in addition environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain federal and state laws is retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and similar environmental agencies that conditions at a number of formerlyowned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites we also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation andor remediation is necessary 

while we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

  our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage hazardous material content and recycling 

the eu china and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal use of hazardous materials in products use of chemicals in manufacturing recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters these laws include the eu restriction of hazardous substances end of life vehicle and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the eu reach chemical registration and evaluation regulation the china law on management methods for controlling pollution by electronic information products and various other laws these laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes registration chemical testing labeling and other matters these laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale these laws could make manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions 

  we are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business we are a defendant in litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights anticompetitive behavior product liability breach of contract and employmentrelated claims in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our bank credit facility contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt as defined in the credit facility to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as defined in the credit facility and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens our outstanding notes indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate merge and sell assets 

although none of these covenants is presently restrictive to our operations our continued ability to meet the bank credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant a breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our bank credit facility if the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder 

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the 

indentures we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

risks relating to our separation from tyco international 

  we share responsibility for certain of our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date 

in connection with the separation from tyco international in 2007 we tyco international and covidien entered into a tax sharing agreement under which we share responsibility for certain of our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of us income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our tyco internationals and covidiens us income tax returns certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation all costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties we are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in addition tyco international and covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula 

all of the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from tyco international became our tax liabilities although we have agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with tyco international and covidien pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities if tyco international and covidien default on their obligations to us under the tax sharing agreement we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities 

if any party to the tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our tyco internationals and covidiens tax liabilities 

our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities in connection with such examinations tax authorities including the us internal revenue service irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments we are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments see additional information in income tax matters in part i item 3 legal proceedings amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that we have assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of accounting standards codification asc 740 income taxes  have been reflected as liabilities on the consolidated financial statements the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances 

due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest 

under the tax sharing agreement tyco international has the right to administer control and settle all us income tax audits for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 the timing nature and amount of any settlement agreed to by tyco international may not be in our best interests moreover the other parties to the tax sharing agreement will be able to remove tyco international as the controlling party only under limited circumstances including a change of control or bankruptcy of tyco international or by a majority vote of the parties all other tax audits will be administered controlled and settled by the party that would be responsible for paying the tax 

  if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

tyco international received private letter rulings from the irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution of our common shares and covidien common shares to the tyco international shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of our common shares and the covidien common shares will qualify as taxfree under sections 368a1d and 355 of the internal revenue code the code the private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the private letter rulings tyco international obtained opinions from outside legal counsel confirming the taxfree status of the distribution and certain internal transactions the private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us tyco international and covidien regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable tyco international would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common shares and covidien common shares distributed to tyco international shareholders on the distribution date over tyco internationals tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however we would incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation should be treated as taxable transactions 

in addition under the terms of the tax sharing agreement in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the distribution by us tyco international or covidien the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us tyco international or covidien as a result thereof if such determination is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us tyco international or covidien then we tyco international or covidien would be responsible for 31 27 and 42 respectively of any taxes imposed on us tyco international or covidien as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant in the event that any party to the tax sharing agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting partys obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other partys taxes 

risks relating to our swiss jurisdiction of incorporation 

  legislative and other proposals in switzerland the us and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

various us and nonus legislative proposals and other initiatives have been directed at companies incorporated in lowertax jurisdictions we believe that recently there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and other initiatives as various jurisdictions look for solutions to fiscal deficits if adopted these proposed changes could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives and we cannot assure you that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us 

  legislation in the us could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to us companies that have moved to lowertax jurisdictions 

we expect the us congress to continue to consider implementation andor expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad we believe that we are less likely to be subject to such proposals since becoming a swiss corporation in june 2009 however we cannot predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals therefore we cannot assure you that any such legislative action will not apply to us in addition we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to us federal or state governments or the willingness of our nongovernmental customers to do business with us as a result of these uncertainties we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot assure you that the impact will not be materially adverse to us 

  as a swiss corporation we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares 

as a swiss corporation our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements our articles of association allow us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors but this authorization is limited to i authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years which authorization period ends on march 6 2015 and ii conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation dividends andor voting moreover under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convene a meeting of shareholders which would delay 

the timing to execute such actions such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management while we do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us we cannot assure you that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors 

  swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

we are organized under the laws of switzerland it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us and switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws would not be allowed in swiss courts as they are contrary to that nations public policy 

swiss corporate law which applies to us differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers thus holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

risks relating to our shares 

  the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors including 

• our quarterly or annual earnings • changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results • volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global economic conditions and investors concerns about potential risks to future economic growth • changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates • changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles • announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions and • the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business   we might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

in order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of swiss withholding tax we anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes or registered share capital various tax law and 

corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes or through a reduction of registered share capital or that swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

under swiss corporate law the registered share capital in our unconsolidated swiss statutory financial statements is required to be denominated in swiss francs since distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in us dollars shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital and consequently are required to be stated in swiss francs if the us dollar were to increase in value relative to the swiss franc the us dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without swiss withholding tax will decrease 

  we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares 

the swiss code of obligations regulates a corporations ability to hold or repurchase its own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation additionally various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to repurchase our shares our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings 

our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by swiss law for swiss companies like us that issue registered shares as opposed to bearer shares this provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights holders of our shares must be registered in our share register aktienbuch as shareholders with voting rights only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders meetings but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends distributions preemptive rights advance subscription rights and liquidation proceeds the board of directors may in its discretion refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association additionally various proposals in switzerland for corporate law changes if passed in the future may require shareholder registration in order to 

exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and banks such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable 

our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered antitakeover provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors under these provisions among others 

• shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent and • restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15 or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors these provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital in either case representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in the case of issuances from authorized capital until march 6 2015 unless reauthorized by shareholders for a subsequent twoyear period without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders preemptive rights or advance subscription rights for the purpose of the defense of an actual threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid in relation to which the board of directors upon consultation with an independent financial advisor has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders we note that swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital in addition the new york stock exchange on which our shares are listed requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power with limited exceptions

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax in addition we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims at any given time in the ordinary course of business we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions if infringement of a third partys patent were to be determined against us we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products if a patent owned by or licensed to us were 

determined to be invalid or unenforceable we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge which could be significant in amount 

at september 26 2014 we had a contingent purchase price commitment of 80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of comnet this represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of comnet only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the state of florida in accordance with guidelines set forth in the contract under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers however the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in june 2006 in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania a liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the consolidated financial statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or reasonably estimable at this time 

management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows however the proceedings discussed below in income tax matters could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

income tax matters 

during fiscal 2007 the irs concluded its field examination of certain of tyco internationals us federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued revenue agent reports that reflected the irs determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period additionally the irs proposed civil fraud penalties against tyco international arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999 the penalties were asserted against a prior subsidiary of tyco international that was distributed to us in connection with the separation tyco international appealed certain of the proposed adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000 and tyco international resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments including reaching an agreement with the irs on the penalty adjustment in the amount of 21 million in october 2012 the irs issued special agreement forms 870ad effectively settling its audit of all tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000 excluding one issue that remains in dispute as described below as a result of these developments in fiscal 2013 we recognized an income tax benefit of 331 million representing a reduction in tax reserves for the matters that were effectively settled and other expense of 231 million representing a reduction of associated indemnification receivables pursuant to the tax sharing agreement with tyco international and covidien 

the disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions the irs field examination asserted that certain intercompany loans originating during the period 1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for us federal income tax purposes and disallowed approximately 27 billion of related interest deductions recognized during the period on tyco internationals us income tax returns in addition if the irs is ultimately successful in asserting its claim it is likely to disallow an additional 66 billion of interest deductions reflected on us income tax returns in years subsequent to fiscal 2000 tyco international contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt for us tax purposes and that the interest deductions reflected on the income tax returns are appropriate the irs and tyco international were unable to resolve this matter through the irs appeals process on june 20 2013 tyco international advised us that it had received notices of deficiency from the irs for certain former us subsidiaries of tyco international increasing taxable income by approximately 29 billion in connection with the audit of tyco internationals fiscal years 1997 through 2000 the notices of deficiency assert that tyco international owes additional taxes totaling 778 million associated penalties of 154 million and withholding taxes of 105 million in 

addition tyco international received final partnership administrative adjustments for certain us partnerships owned by former us subsidiaries with respect to which tyco international estimates an additional tax deficiency of approximately 30 million will be asserted the amounts asserted by the irs exclude any applicable deficiency interest and do not reflect any impact to subsequent period tax liabilities in the event that the irs were to prevail on some or all of its assertions we understand that tyco international strongly disagrees with the irs position and has filed petitions in the us tax court contesting the irs proposed adjustments tyco international has advised us that it believes there are meritorious defenses for the tax filings in question and that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing us treasury regulations 

a us tax court trial date of february 29 2016 has been set and the parties are engaged in discovery te does not expect any payments to the irs with respect to these matters until they are fully and finally resolved in accordance with the tax sharing agreement we tyco international and covidien would share 31 27 and 42 respectively of any payments made in connection with these matters 

if the irs were to prevail on its assertions our share of the assessed tax deficiency interest and applicable withholding taxes and penalties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows we have reviewed the notices of deficiency the relevant facts surrounding the intercompany debt transactions relevant tax regulations and applicable case law and we continue to believe that we are appropriately reserved for this matter

overview 

we are a global technology leader we design and manufacture connectivity and sensors solutions essential in todays increasingly connected world we help our customers solve the need for intelligent efficient and highperforming products and solutions 

during fiscal 2014 we realigned certain businesses within our segment reporting structure to better align our product portfolio we continue to operate through four reporting segments transportation solutions industrial solutions network solutions and consumer solutions see notes 1 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our segments prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the current segment reporting structure 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions our sales are dependent on certain industry end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending and our operating results can be affected by changes in demand in those markets 

overall our fiscal 2014 net sales increased 48 as compared to fiscal 2013 increased net sales in the transportation solutions segment and to a lesser degree the industrial solutions segment were partially offset by declines in the network solutions segment and to a lesser degree the consumer solutions segment on an organic basis net sales increased 46 during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 in the transportation solutions segment our net sales in the automotive end market increased 104 on an organic basis during fiscal 2014 with sales increases in all regions in the industrial solutions segment our organic net sales increased 52 in fiscal 2014 due primarily to growth in the industrial equipment and aerospace defense oil and gas end markets driven by the asia–pacific region in the network solutions segment on an organic basis our net sales decreased 32 in fiscal 2014 due primarily to declines in the subsea communications and data communications end markets in the consumer solutions segment our organic net sales decreased 10 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 as declines in the consumer devices end market were partially offset by increases in the appliances end market 

overall our fiscal 2013 net sales were consistent with fiscal 2012 levels increased net sales in the transportation solutions segment were offset by declines in the network solutions and consumer 

solutions segments on an organic basis our net sales decreased 13 during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 in the transportation solutions segment our organic net sales in the automotive end market increased 49 during fiscal 2013 with sales increases in the americas and to a lesser degree the asia–pacific and emea regions in the network solutions segment our organic net sales decreased 58 in fiscal 2013 due primarily to weakness in the subsea communications and data communications end markets in the industrial solutions segment on an organic basis our net sales decreased 46 in fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of declines in the industrial equipment end market in the consumer solutions segment our organic net sales decreased 51 in fiscal 2013 due primarily to declines in the consumer devices end market 

the acquisition of deutsch in april 2012 benefited our sales in the automotive and aerospace defense oil and gas end markets in the transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments respectively and contributed net sales of 327 million in fiscal 2012 also deutsch contributed incremental net sales of 320 million in the first six months of fiscal 2013 over the same period of fiscal 2012 

outlook 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we expect net sales to be between 346 billion and 356 billion primarily reflecting sales increases of approximately 10 in the transportation solutions segment and to a lesser degree in the industrial solutions segment partially offset by a decrease in the consumer solutions segment relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2014 in the transportation solutions segment we expect our sales growth to outpace an anticipated 1 to 2 growth in global automotive production in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2014 in addition the transportation solutions segment will benefit from the recently completed acquisition of measurement specialties in the industrial solutions segment we expect our sales to increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2014 due primarily to increased sales in the aerospace defense oil and gas end market our sales in the aerospace defense oil and gas end market will benefit from the acquisition of the seacon group seacon in the network solutions segment we expect a modest sales increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 due primarily to increased sales in the subsea communications end market we expect our net sales in the subsea communications end market to be approximately 115 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 in the consumer solutions segment we expect our sales decrease in the consumer devices end market to be partially offset by a sales increase in the appliances end market in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 095 to 099 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 this outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately 100 million and 003 per share respectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2014 

for fiscal 2015 we expect net sales to be between 147 billion and 153 billion this primarily reflects sales increases in the transportation solutions and network solutions segments and to a lesser degree the industrial solutions segment from fiscal 2014 levels in the transportation solutions segment we expect our sales growth to outpace an anticipated 25 to 3 growth in global automotive production from fiscal 2014 levels we expect measurement specialties to contribute approximately 600 million in sales to the transportation solutions segment in fiscal 2015 in the network solutions segment we expect our sales to increase approximately 10 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 with growth driven by a sales increase of approximately 300 million in the subsea communications end market in the industrial solutions segment we expect our sales to increase in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 due primarily to increased sales in the aerospace defense oil and gas end market in the consumer solutions segment we expect our sales decrease in the consumer devices end market to be offset by a sales increase in the appliances end market in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 we 

expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 399 to 429 per share in fiscal 2015 this outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately 400 million and 015 per share respectively in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 

the above outlook is based on foreign exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels 

we are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve additionally we continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions we also are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest furthermore management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement income tax benefits may be recognized 

we have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries earnings that are expected to be distributed in the future no additional provision has been made for swiss or nonswiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested the investments are essentially permanent in duration or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings as of september 26 2014 certain subsidiaries had approximately 18 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations including working capital property plant and equipment intangible assets and research and development activities a liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by 

such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed it is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries as of september 26 2014 we had approximately 55 billion of cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits principally in our subsidiaries that we have the ability to distribute to tyco electronics group sa tegsa our luxembourg subsidiary which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt and to te connectivity ltd our swiss parent company but we consider to be permanently reinvested we estimate that up to approximately 17 billion of tax expense would be recognized on our consolidated financial statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations including investing and financing activities 

loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes during fiscal 2012 we sold our touch solutions business for net cash proceeds of 380 million and recognized an insignificant pretax gain on the transaction the agreement includes contingent earnout provisions through 2015 based on business performance in connection with the divestiture we incurred an income tax charge of 65 million which is included in loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2012 this charge was driven primarily by the inability to fully realize a tax benefit associated with the writeoff of goodwill at the time of the sale

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows 



our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets money markets or other sources of funding as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements we believe that cash generated from operations and to the extent necessary these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future including the payment of 250 million of 160 senior notes due in february 2015 we may use excess cash to reduce our outstanding debt including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program to pay distributions or dividends on our common shares or to acquire strategic businesses or product lines on october 9 2014 we acquired measurement specialties the total value paid which included the repayment of debt was approximately 17 billion net of cash acquired in anticipation of the acquisition we had previously raised funds through the issuance of 1 billion of senior notes see additional information regarding debt and the acquisition of measurement specialties in notes 11 and 24 respectively to the consolidated financial statements the cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions we will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions

in march 2014 our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of chf 104 equivalent to 116 per share out of contributed surplus payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 through the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we paid the first and second installments of the dividend at a rate of 029 per share during the quarters ended june 27 2014 and september 26 2014 respectively 

future dividends on our common shares or reductions of registered share capital for distribution to shareholders if any must be approved by our shareholders in exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends or distributions be approved our board of directors will consider our results of operations cash requirements and surplus financial condition statutory requirements of applicable law contractual restrictions and other factors that they may deem relevant 

during fiscal 2014 our board of directors authorized an increase of 1 billion in the share repurchase program we repurchased approximately 11 million of our common shares for 604 million approximately 20 million of our common shares for 829 million and approximately 6 million of our common shares for 194 million during fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively at september 26 2014 we had 874 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization 

commitments and contingencies 

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable leases and other obligations at fiscal year end 2014 



1 interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps 2 purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services 3 the table above does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of 1597 million and related accrued interest and penalties of 1136 million the timing of which is uncertain see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits interest and penalties 4 the table above does not reflect pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees we are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans however we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type including timing interest rate charges investment performance and amounts of benefit payments we expect to contribute 84 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2015 before consideration of voluntary contributions these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 5 other longterm liabilities of 332 million are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items 

legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including patent infringement claims product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows however the proceedings discussed below in income tax matters could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows see part i item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding legal proceedings 

at september 26 2014 we had a contingent purchase price commitment of 80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of comnet this represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of comnet only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the state of florida in accordance with guidelines set forth in the contract under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers however the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in june 2006 in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania a liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the consolidated financial statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or reasonably estimable at this time 

income tax matters 

in connection with the separation from tyco international in 2007 we entered into a tax sharing agreement that generally governs our tyco internationals and covidiens respective rights responsibilities and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes if any incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of our shares or the shares of covidien to qualify as a taxfree distribution for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoffs to qualify for taxfavored treatment under the code 

pursuant to the tax sharing agreement upon separation we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and covidien under the tax sharing agreement we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters of tyco international the effect of the tax sharing agreement is to indemnify us for 69 of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved preseparation tax matters pursuant to that indemnification we have made similar indemnifications to tyco international and covidien with respect to 31 of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation we are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in addition tyco international and covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula 

prior to separation certain of our subsidiaries filed combined income tax returns with tyco international those and other of our subsidiaries income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments tyco international as the us income tax audit controlling party under the tax sharing agreement is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 which relate specifically to our entities have been recorded on the consolidated financial statements in addition we may be required to fund portions of tyco internationals and covidiens tax obligations estimates about these guarantees also have been recognized on the consolidated financial statements see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during fiscal 2007 the irs concluded its field examination of certain of tyco internationals us federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued revenue agent reports that reflected the irs determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period additionally the irs proposed civil fraud penalties against tyco international arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999 the penalties were asserted against a prior subsidiary of tyco international that was distributed to us in connection with the separation tyco international appealed certain of the proposed 

adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000 and tyco international resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments including reaching an agreement with the irs on the penalty adjustment in the amount of 21 million in october 2012 the irs issued special agreement forms 870ad effectively settling its audit of all tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000 excluding one issue that remains in dispute as described below as a result of these developments in fiscal 2013 we recognized an income tax benefit of 331 million representing a reduction in tax reserves for the matters that were effectively settled and other expense of 231 million representing a reduction of associated indemnification receivables pursuant to the tax sharing agreement with tyco international and covidien 

the disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions the irs field examination asserted that certain intercompany loans originating during the period 1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for us federal income tax purposes and disallowed approximately 27 billion of related interest deductions recognized during the period on tyco internationals us income tax returns in addition if the irs is ultimately successful in asserting its claim it is likely to disallow an additional 66 billion of interest deductions reflected on us income tax returns in years subsequent to fiscal 2000 tyco international contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt for us tax purposes and that the interest deductions reflected on the income tax returns are appropriate the irs and tyco international were unable to resolve this matter through the irs appeals process on june 20 2013 tyco international advised us that it had received notices of deficiency from the irs for certain former us subsidiaries of tyco international increasing taxable income by approximately 29 billion in connection with the audit of tyco internationals fiscal years 1997 through 2000 the notices of deficiency assert that tyco international owes additional taxes totaling 778 million associated penalties of 154 million and withholding taxes of 105 million in addition tyco international received final partnership administrative adjustments for certain us partnerships owned by former us subsidiaries with respect to which tyco international estimates an additional tax deficiency of approximately 30 million will be asserted the amounts asserted by the irs exclude any applicable deficiency interest and do not reflect any impact to subsequent period tax liabilities in the event that the irs were to prevail on some or all of its assertions we understand that tyco international strongly disagrees with the irs position and has filed petitions in the us tax court contesting the irs proposed adjustments tyco international has advised us that it believes there are meritorious defenses for the tax filings in question and that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing us treasury regulations 

a us tax court trial date of february 29 2016 has been set and the parties are engaged in discovery te does not expect any payments to the irs with respect to these matters until they are fully and finally resolved in accordance with the tax sharing agreement we tyco international and covidien would share 31 27 and 42 respectively of any payments made in connection with these matters 

if the irs were to prevail on its assertions our share of the assessed tax deficiency interest and applicable withholding taxes and penalties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows we have reviewed the notices of deficiency the relevant facts surrounding the intercompany debt transactions relevant tax regulations and applicable case law and we continue to believe that we are appropriately reserved for this matter 

during fiscal 2014 we made net payments of 179 million related to preseparation tax matters including 198 million of indemnification payments made to tyco international and covidien in connection with their advanced payments for expected deficiencies made to the irs for the 2005 through 2007 audit cycle we made net payments of 28 million and 19 million related to preseparation tax matters during fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively 

tyco internationals income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 remain subject to adjustment by the irs upon ultimate resolution of the disputed issue involving certain intercompany loans originated during the period 1997 through 2000 for the undisputed issues for years 2001 through 2004 it is our understanding that tyco international expects to receive and accept general agreement forms 870 from the irs during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 the irs commenced its audit of certain tyco international income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011 and it is our understanding that tyco international expects the irs to issue general agreement forms 870 during the first half of fiscal 2015 over the next twelve months we expect to make net cash payments of approximately 31 million in connection with preseparation us tax matters 

during fiscal 2012 the irs commenced its audit of our income tax returns for the years 2008 through 2010 we expect fieldwork for the 2008 through 2010 audit to conclude in fiscal 2015 

at september 26 2014 and september 27 2013 we have reflected 51 million and 15 million respectively of income tax liabilities related to the audits of tyco internationals and our income tax returns in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within the next twelve months 

we believe that the amounts recorded on our consolidated financial statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate however the ultimate resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in certain instances we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2015 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

at september 26 2014 we had outstanding letters of credit letters of guarantee and surety bonds in the amount of 408 million 

we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these liabilities 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance in the opinion of management such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

pursuant to the tax sharing agreement upon separation we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and covidien under the tax sharing agreement we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters of tyco international the effect of the tax sharing agreement is to indemnify us for 69 of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved preseparation tax matters pursuant to that indemnification we have made similar indemnifications to tyco international and covidien with respect to 31 of certain liabilities 

settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation these arrangements were valued upon our separation from tyco international in accordance with asc 460 guarantees  at september 26 2014 we had a liability representing the indemnifications made to tyco international and covidien pursuant to the tax sharing agreement of 21 million recorded on the consolidated balance sheet see notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are considered to be the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

revenue recognition 

our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with asc 605 revenue recognition  our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer this generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured for those items where title has not yet transferred we have deferred the recognition of revenue a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies a reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and also is recorded as a reduction of sales 

contract revenues for construction related projects which are generated in the network solutions segment are recorded primarily using the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete percentageofcompletion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable in addition provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

acquired intangible assets include both indeterminablelived residual goodwill and determinablelived identifiable intangible assets intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents trademarks and unpatented technology as well as customer relationships recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straightline basis an evaluation of the remaining useful life of determinablelived intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation we assess determinablelived intangible assets for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other longlived assets for impairment goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from determinablelived intangible assets by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred in assessing the existence of a triggering event management 

relies on a number of reportingunitspecific factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors to the goodwill impairment analysis 

a reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management at fiscal year end 2014 we had seven reporting units six of which contained goodwill there is one reporting unit in the transportation solutions segment and two reporting units in each of the industrial solutions network solutions and consumer solutions segments we review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test or more frequently based on changes in our structure 

when testing for goodwill impairment we follow the guidance prescribed in asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  first we perform a step i goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment in doing so we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill may be impaired and a step ii goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment if any in the step ii goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 

fair value estimates used in the step i goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit the income approach generally has been supported by guideline analyses a market approach these approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates discount rates income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and determined that no impairment existed 

income taxes 

in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and nonus pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings any changes in a valuation allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition will be reflected in the income tax provision 

changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest furthermore management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement income tax benefits may be recognized these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

pension and postretirement benefits 

our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions the funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date for defined benefit pension plans the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels for the postretirement benefit plans the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered the fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds held for the sole benefit of participants which are invested by the trustee of the funds the benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors such as years of service and compensation 

net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants 

two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and employee turnover these 

assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations at fiscal year end 2014 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by 140 million a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by 125 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets would have increased or decreased respectively our fiscal 2014 pension expense by 10 million 

during fiscal 2012 our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the us plans master trust from a previous target of 30 equity and 70 fixed income to 10 equity and 90 fixed income in an effort to better protect the funded status of the us plans master trust asset reallocation will continue over a multiyear period based on the funded status as defined by the pension protection act of 2006 the pension act funded status of the us plans master trust and market conditions we expect to reach our target allocation when the pension act funded status exceeds 100 based on the pension act funded status as of september 26 2014 our target asset allocation is 44 equity and 56 fixed income 

acquisitions 

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting this method requires among other things that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values or as required by asc 805 business combinations  the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill we may engage independent thirdparty appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer and distributor relationships acquired developed technologies and patents expected costs to develop inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from projects when completed brand awareness and market position as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio customer and distributor attrition rates royalty rates and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

contingent liabilities 

we record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable when a range of possible losses with equal likelihood exists we record the low end of the range the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available in addition it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must continuously be evaluated to determine whether a loss is probable and a reasonable estimate of that loss can be made when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made or when a loss is at least reasonably possible disclosure is provided

nongaap financial measures 

organic net sales growth 

organic net sales growth is a nongaap financial measure the difference between reported net sales growth the most comparable gaap measure and organic net sales growth the nongaap measure consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates acquisitions and divestitures organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business it excludes items that are not completely under managements control such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company such as acquisition and divestiture activity 

we believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business furthermore it provides investors with a view of our operations from managements perspective we use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations management uses organic net sales growth together with gaap measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations the discussion and analysis of organic net sales growth in results of operations above utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies organic net sales growth amounts presented above may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies organic net sales growth is a nongaap financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales this limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our gaap net sales the tables presented in results of operations above provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under gaap 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure the difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities the most comparable gaap measure and free cash flow the nongaap measure consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify free cash flow is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash it also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans we believe free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations 

free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items minus net capital expenditures net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment these items are subtracted because they represent longterm commitments voluntary pension contributions are excluded from the gaap measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity certain special items including net payments related 

to preseparation tax matters also are considered by management in evaluating free cash flow we believe investors also should consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow 

free cash flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures reported by other companies the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our gaap cash flow also it subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within managements and the board of directors discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable gaap measure indicates this limitation is best addressed by using free cash flow in combination with the gaap cash flow results it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures as our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain nondiscretionary expenditures such as debt payments in addition we may have other discretionary expenditures such as discretionary dividends share repurchases and business acquisitions that are not considered in the calculation of free cash flow 

the tables presented in liquidity and capital resources above provide reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from continuing operating activities calculated under gaap 

forwardlooking information 

certain statements in this report are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the us private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management forwardlooking statements include among others the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations business strategies financing plans competitive position potential growth opportunities potential operating performance improvements acquisitions the effects of competition and the effects of future legislation or regulations forwardlooking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as the words believe expect plan intend anticipate estimate predict potential continue may should or the negative of these terms or similar expressions 

forwardlooking statements involve risks uncertainties and assumptions actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements you should not put undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements we do not have any intention or obligation to update forwardlooking statements after we file this report except as required by law 

the following and other risks which are described in greater detail in part i item 1a risk factors as well as other risks described in this annual report also could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements 

• conditions in the global or regional economies and global capital markets and cyclical industry conditions • conditions affecting demand for products in the industries we serve particularly the automotive industry • competition and pricing pressure • market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations and product life cycles • raw material availability quality and cost • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates • financial condition and consolidation of customers and vendors • reliance on thirdparty suppliers • risks associated with current and future acquisitions and divestitures 60 

• global risks of business interruptions such as natural disasters and political economic and military instability • risks associated with security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure • risks related to compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations • our ability to protect our intellectual property rights • risks of litigation • our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by our debt instruments • risks relating to our separation on june 29 2007 from tyco international • the possible effects on us of various us and nonus legislative proposals and other initiatives that if adopted could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate and negatively impact our us government contracts business • various risks associated with being a swiss corporation • the impact of fluctuations in the market price of our shares and • the impact of certain provisions of our articles of association on unsolicited takeover proposals there may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks 

we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an aa2 credit rating there is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty 

foreign currency exposures 

as part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we utilize foreign currency forward and swap contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our foreign currency forward or swap contracts from the september 26 2014 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our forward and swap contracts by 16 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our foreign currency forward or swap contracts from the september 27 2013 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our forward and swap contracts by 27 million such gains or losses on these contracts would be generally offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions 

interest rate and investment exposures 

we issue debt as needed to fund our operations and capital requirements such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure to manage the interest rate exposure we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixedrate debt into variablerate debt we use forward starting interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixedrate debt we also utilize investment swaps to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities 

during fiscal 2014 we entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on 300 million principal amount of our 350 senior notes due 2022 the maturity dates of the interest rate swaps coincide with the maturity date of the notes under these contracts we receive fixed amounts of interest applicable to the underlying notes and pay floating amounts based upon the threemonth libor 

based on our floating rate debt balances of approximately 950 million at september 26 2014 and 150 million at september 27 2013 an increase in the levels of the us dollar interest rates by 05 with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately 5 million and 1 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013 respectively 

commodity exposures 

our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges we continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts in order to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period at september 26 2014 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net loss position of 21 million and had a notional value of 307 million at september 27 2013 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net loss position of 27 million and had a notional value of 278 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the september 26 2014 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 29 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the september 27 2013 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 25 million

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas where we may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition 

our research and development expense was as follows 



intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including patents and patent applications as available in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical optical and electronic products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks 

while we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents 

employees 

as of september 27 2013 we employed approximately 84000 people worldwide of whom 27000 were in the americas region 27000 were in the europemiddle eastafrica region and 30000 were in the asia–pacific region of our total employees approximately 49000 were employed in manufacturing 

government regulation and supervision 

the import and export of products are subject to regulation by the united states us and other countries a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events we have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction 

environmental 

our operations are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment greenhouse gas emissions hazardous materials in products chemical usage and others we are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment we maintain a global 

environmental health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards staff dedicated to environmental health and safety issues periodic compliance auditing training and other measures we have a program for compliance with the european union eu restriction of hazardous substances and waste electrical and electronics equipment directives the china restriction of hazardous substances law the eu reach chemical registration and evaluation regulation and similar laws 

compliance with these laws has in the past and may in the future increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways for example laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection management and reporting and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products we also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations based upon our experience current information and applicable laws we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 12 million to 24 million as of september 27 2013 we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately 13 million we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2014 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to risks that affect many other companies such as general economic conditions geopolitical events competition technological obsolescence labor relations natural disasters and international operations additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations financial condition and liquidity 

risks relating to our business 

  conditions in global or regional economies capital and money markets and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit end demand from consumer and industrial markets and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults any of which could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow and ability to obtain financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full further our vendors may experience similar problems which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels if regional or global economic conditions deteriorate our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected also deterioration in economic conditions could trigger the recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other longlived assets impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position 

  we are dependent on the automotive and other industries 

we are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets periodic downturns in our customers industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

approximately 41 of our net sales for fiscal 2013 were to customers in the automotive industry the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers additionally the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions as a supplier of automotive electronics products our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic and credit conditions and changes in the operations products business models partsourcing requirements financial condition and market share of automotive manufacturers as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers 

during fiscal 2013 our sales into the telecom networks industrial aerospace defense and marine and consumer devices end markets accounted for 9 9 8 and 8 respectively of our net sales the telecom networks industry has historically experienced fluctuations in demand resulting from changes in carrier activity and capital investments by customers demand for industrial equipment is dependent upon economic conditions the aerospace and defense industry has undergone significant fluctuations in demand depending on worldwide economic and political conditions the consumer devices industry can experience variability in demand depending on the underlying business and consumer demand for computer and consumer electronics products as well as the market share of our customers 

  we encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry 

we operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology our ability to participate in emerging markets and customers expectations relating to socially responsible operations the competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large diversified manufacturers to small highly specialized manufacturers the electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities a number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products we cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue 

substantially all of the markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences which are rapid in certain end markets our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design develop introduce and sell new and innovative products to modify existing products and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change there are numerous risks inherent in these processes including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands 

  like other suppliers to the electronics industry we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices 

we have historically experienced and we expect to continue to experience continuing pressure to lower our prices in recent years we have experienced price erosion of approximately 1 each year in 

order to maintain our margins we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts we cannot assure you that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our results are sensitive to raw material availability quality and cost 

we are a large buyer of resin copper gold silver brass steel chemicals and additives zinc and other precious metals many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers in addition the price of many of these raw materials including gold and copper has increased in recent years and continues to fluctuate in recent years we have only been able to partially offset these increases through higher selling prices our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are continued significant price increases for these raw materials any of these events could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials and to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers our margins may decline materially affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices the success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials we could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo drc as a result the sec established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the drc and adjoining countries in their products these requirements were effective for the calendar year beginning january 1 2013 these requirements could affect the sourcing pricing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we are implementing 

  foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue approximately 53 of our net sales for fiscal 2013 were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect nonus dollar revenue to represent a significant and likely increased portion of our future net revenue therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro or asian currencies our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage this risk in part by entering into financial derivative contracts in addition to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to these contracts our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful 

  we may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate 

many of the industries to which we sell our products as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials have become more concentrated in recent years including the automotive telecommunications computer and aerospace and defense industries consolidation of customers may 

lead to decreased product purchases from us in addition as our customers buy in larger volumes their volume buying power has increased enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing these trends may adversely affect the profit margins on our products particularly for commodity components 

  the life cycles of our products can be very short 

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle as a result the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment if we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  future acquisitions may not be successful 

we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings we cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future we also cannot assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity 

if we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements this acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot assure you that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to make an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares 

  our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain executive management employees and limitations affecting retention and hiring including new swiss regulations could have a negative impact on our business and increase our expenses 

our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our executive management employees and hire new executive management employees to replace succeed or add to members of our executive management team our executive management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for executive talent is intense and we compete for these personnel with other companies that are regulated by the laws of jurisdictions that provide significantly greater flexibility than switzerland our jurisdiction of incorporation in compensation practices for executive management employees as a swiss company we are and will be subject to limitations on compensation practices for our current and future executive management employees under a recently passed swiss constitutional amendment the minder initiative and its proposed regulations the new swiss regulations which come into effect on and after january 1 2014 the new swiss regulations among other things will require an annual binding sayonpay vote by shareholders for the compensation of our executive management employees and board of directors prohibit most forms of severance payments advance payments and payments provided in connection with a change of control of the company or an acquired or divested business unit require that many 

aspects of the compensation practices for our executive management employees and board of directors be included in our articles of association and subject to the approval of shareholders when initially implemented and when changed in the future and subject our management and board of directors to criminal sanctions relating to actions taken in connection with certain compensation practices the new swiss regulations restrictions on compensation practices generally are not representative of the regulatory environment applicable to most nonswiss companies and the applicability of the new swiss regulations to us could make it more difficult for us to retain and compete on a global basis for certain members of our executive management team who report to our chief executive officer the loss of the services of one or more of our key executive management employees or our difficulty in hiring new executive management employees could have a negative impact on our business in addition the development of compensation practices complying in all respects with the new swiss regulations as well as the search for new executive management personnel in the future could divert managements time and attention and result in increased expenses to us furthermore we are subject to the exchange act and its proxy rules which provide for a nonbinding sayonpay vote by our shareholders for compensation of our chief executive officer chief financial officer and three other most highly compensated executive officers and other disclosures relating to our executive compensation the regulatory scheme under the new swiss regulations for executive compensation is not consistent with the secs regulatory scheme and the two conflicting bodies of executive compensation regulations applicable to us could lead to confusing and inconsistent proposals to our shareholders for approval at annual general meetings and inconsistencies in executive compensation disclosure in related proxy statements and our other sec disclosure documents 

  we could suffer significant business interruptions 

our operations and those of our suppliers and customers and the supply chains that supports their operations may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis typhoons or floods or other disasters such as fires explosions acts of terrorism or war disease or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  we may use components and products manufactured by third parties 

we may rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we may rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if these third parties fail to deliver quality products parts and components on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

  our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology 

the electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights within this industry companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights depending on the importance of the technology product patent trademark or trade secret in question an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  a decline in the market value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

concerns about deterioration in the global economy together with concerns about credit inflation or deflation have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities including fixed income and equity securities which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans investment portfolios in addition the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved a decrease in the value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding 

the global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit recent downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital as a result we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures the extent of any impact will depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions 

  divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered 

  if any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations our business may suffer 

our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the us and the eu these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electrical components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we also may be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable if we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements whether at all or in material part our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected further any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are subject to global risks of political economic and military instability 

our workforce manufacturing research administrative and sales facilities markets customers and suppliers are located throughout the world as a result we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including 

• tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes • regulations related to customs and importexport matters • variations in lengths of payment cycles • tax issues such as tax law changes examinations by taxing authorities variations in tax laws from country to country and difficulties in the taxefficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions • challenges in collecting accounts receivable • employment regulations and local labor conditions including increases in employment costs particularly in lowcost regions in which we currently operate • difficulties protecting intellectual property • instability in economic or political conditions including sovereign debt levels eurozone uncertainty inflation recession and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts and • the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements we have sizeable operations in china including 16 manufacturing sites in addition approximately 15 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 were made to customers in china the legal system in china is still developing and is subject to change accordingly our operations and orders for products in china could be adversely affected by changes to or interpretation of chinese law 

in addition any downgrade by rating agencies of longterm us sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions which could negatively affect our business financial condition and liquidity 

  we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk antibribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk antibribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance program we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate these laws and regulations govern among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials 17 

• emissions or discharges of substances into the environment • investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites • greenhouse gas emissions • product hazardous material content and • the health and safety of our employees we may not have been or we may not at all times be in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators in addition environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain federal and state laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and similar environmental agencies that conditions at a number of formerlyowned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites 

while we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

  our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage hazardous material content and recycling 

the eu china and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal use of hazardous materials in products use of chemicals in manufacturing recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters these laws include the eu restriction of hazardous substances end of life vehicle and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the eu reach chemical registration and evaluation regulation the china law on management methods for controlling pollution by electronic information products and various other laws these laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes registration chemical testing labeling and other matters these laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale these laws could make manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions 

  we are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business we are a defendant in litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights anticompetitive behavior product liability breach of contract and employmentrelated claims in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our bank credit facility contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt as defined in the credit facility to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as defined in the credit facility and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens our outstanding notes indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate merge and sell assets 

although none of these covenants is presently restrictive to our operations our continued ability to meet the bank credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant a breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our bank credit facility if the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder 

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

risks relating to our separation from tyco international 

  we share responsibility for certain of our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date 

in connection with our separation from tyco international in 2007 we tyco international and its former healthcare businesses covidien entered into a tax sharing agreement under which we share responsibility for certain of our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of us income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our tyco internationals and covidiens us income tax returns certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in 

anticipation of the separation all costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties we are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in addition tyco international and covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula 

all of the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from tyco international became our tax liabilities although we have agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with tyco international and covidien pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities if tyco international and covidien default on their obligations to us under the tax sharing agreement we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities 

if any party to the tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our tyco internationals and covidiens tax liabilities 

our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities in connection with such examinations tax authorities including the us internal revenue service irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments we are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments see additional information in income tax matters in part i item 3 legal proceedings amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that we have assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of accounting standards codification asc 740 income taxes  have been reflected as liabilities on the consolidated financial statements the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest 

under the tax sharing agreement tyco international has the right to administer control and settle all us income tax audits for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 the timing nature and amount of any settlement agreed to by tyco international may not be in our best interests moreover the other parties to the tax sharing agreement will be able to remove tyco international as the controlling party only under limited circumstances including a change of control or bankruptcy of tyco international or by a majority vote of the parties all other tax audits will be administered controlled and settled by the party that would be responsible for paying the tax 

  if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

tyco international received private letter rulings from the irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution of our common shares and covidien common shares to the tyco international shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution except for cash received in 

lieu of a fractional share of our common shares and the covidien common shares will qualify as taxfree under sections 368a1d and 355 of the internal revenue code the code the private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the private letter rulings tyco international obtained opinions from outside legal counsel confirming the taxfree status of the distribution and certain internal transactions the private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us tyco international and covidien regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable tyco international would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common shares and covidien common shares distributed to tyco international shareholders on the distribution date over tyco internationals tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however we would incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation should be treated as taxable transactions 

in addition under the terms of the tax sharing agreement in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the distribution by us tyco international or covidien the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us tyco international or covidien as a result thereof if such determination is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us tyco international or covidien then we tyco international or covidien would be responsible for 31 27 and 42 respectively of any taxes imposed on us tyco international or covidien as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant in the event that any party to the tax sharing agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting partys obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other partys taxes 

risks relating to our swiss jurisdiction of incorporation 

  legislative and other proposals in switzerland the us and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

various us and nonus legislative proposals and other initiatives have been directed at companies incorporated in lowertax jurisdictions we believe that recently there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and other initiatives as various jurisdictions look for solutions to fiscal deficits if adopted these proposed changes could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives and we cannot assure you that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us 

  legislation in the us could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to us companies that have moved to lowertax jurisdictions 

we expect the us congress to continue to consider implementation andor expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad we believe that we are less likely to be subject to such proposals since becoming a swiss corporation in june 2009 however we cannot predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals therefore we cannot assure you that any such legislative action will not apply to us in addition we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to us federal or state governments or the willingness of our nongovernmental customers to do business with us as a result of these uncertainties we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot assure you that the impact will not be materially adverse to us 

  as a swiss corporation we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares 

as a swiss corporation our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements our articles of association allow us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors but this authorization is limited to i authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years which authorization period ends on march 6 2015 and ii conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation dividends andor voting moreover under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convene a meeting of shareholders which would delay the timing to execute such actions such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management while we do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us we cannot assure you that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors 

  swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the us and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

we are organized under the laws of switzerland it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us and switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions including some 

remedies available under the us federal securities laws would not be allowed in swiss courts as they are contrary to that nations public policy 

swiss corporate law which applies to us differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers thus holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

risks relating to our shares 

  the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors including 

• our quarterly or annual earnings • changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results • volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global economic conditions and investors concerns about potential risks to future economic growth • changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates • changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles • announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions and • the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business   we might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

in order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of swiss withholding tax we anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes or registered share capital various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes or through a reduction of registered share capital or that swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

under swiss corporate law we are required to state our year end unconsolidated swiss statutory financial statements in swiss francs although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in us dollars shareholder 

resolutions with respect to such distributions are required to be stated in swiss francs if the us dollar were to increase in value relative to the swiss franc the us dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without swiss withholding tax will decrease 

  we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares 

the swiss code of obligations regulates a corporations ability to hold or repurchase its own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation additionally various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to repurchase our shares our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings 

our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by swiss law for swiss companies like us that issue registered shares as opposed to bearer shares this provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights holders of our shares must be registered in our share register aktienbuch as shareholders with voting rights only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders meetings but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends distributions preemptive rights advance subscription rights and liquidation proceeds the board of directors may in its discretion refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association additionally various proposals in switzerland for corporate law changes if passed in the future may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and banks such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable 

our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered antitakeover provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors under these provisions among others 

• shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent and • restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15 or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors these provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital 

in either case representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in the case of issuances from authorized capital until march 6 2015 unless reauthorized by shareholders for a subsequent twoyear period without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders preemptive rights or advance subscription rights for the purpose of the defense of an actual threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid in relation to which the board of directors upon consultation with an independent financial advisor has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders we note that swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital in addition the new york stock exchange on which our shares are listed requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power with limited exceptions

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax in addition we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims at any given time in the ordinary course of business we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions if infringement of a third partys patent were to be determined against us we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products if a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge which could be significant in amount 

at september 27 2013 we had a contingent purchase price commitment of 80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of comnet this represents the maximum amount payable to the former 

shareholders of comnet only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the state of florida in accordance with guidelines set forth in the contract under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers however the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in june 2006 in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania which is in the discovery phase a liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the consolidated financial statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable at this time 

management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows however the proceedings discussed below in income tax matters could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

income tax matters 

during fiscal 2007 the irs concluded its field examination of certain of tyco internationals us federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued revenue agent reports that reflected the irs determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period additionally the irs proposed civil fraud penalties against tyco international arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999 the penalties were asserted against a prior subsidiary of tyco international that was distributed to us in connection with the separation tyco international appealed certain of the proposed adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000 and tyco international resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments including reaching an agreement with the irs on the penalty adjustment in the amount of 21 million in october 2012 the irs issued special agreement forms 870ad effectively settling its audit of all tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000 excluding one issue that remains in dispute as described below as a result of these developments in fiscal 2013 we recognized an income tax benefit of 331 million and other expense of 231 million pursuant to the tax sharing agreement with tyco international and covidien 

the disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions the irs field examination asserted that certain intercompany loans originating during the period 1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for us federal income tax purposes and disallowed approximately 27 billion of related interest deductions recognized during the period on tyco internationals us income tax returns in addition if the irs is ultimately successful in asserting its claim it is likely to disallow an additional 66 billion of interest deductions reflected on us income tax returns in years subsequent to fiscal 2000 tyco international contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt for us tax purposes and that the interest deductions reflected on the income tax returns are appropriate the irs and tyco international were unable to resolve this matter through the irs appeals process on june 20 2013 tyco international advised us that it had received notices of deficiency from the irs for certain former us subsidiaries of tyco international increasing taxable income by approximately 29 billion in connection with the audit of tyco internationals fiscal years 1997 through 2000 the notices of deficiency assert that tyco international owes additional taxes totaling 778 million associated penalties of 154 million and withholding taxes of 105 million in addition tyco international received final partnership administrative adjustments for certain us partnerships owned by former us subsidiaries with respect to which tyco international estimates an additional tax deficiency of approximately 30 million will be asserted the amounts asserted by the irs exclude any applicable deficiency interest and do not reflect any impact to subsequent period tax liabilities in the event that the irs were to prevail on some or all of its assertions we understand that tyco international strongly disagrees with the irs position and has filed petitions in the us tax court 

contesting the irs proposed adjustments tyco international has advised us that it believes there are meritorious defenses for the tax filings in question and that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing treasury regulations 

resolution of this matter in the us tax court could take several years and no payments to the irs with respect to these matters would be required until the matter is fully and finally resolved in accordance with the terms of a tax sharing agreement we tyco international and covidien would share 31 27 and 42 respectively of any payments made in connection with these matters 

however as the ultimate outcome is uncertain and if the irs were to prevail on its assertions our share of the assessed tax deficiency interest and applicable withholding taxes and penalties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows we have reviewed the notices of deficiency the relevant facts surrounding the intercompany debt transactions relevant tax regulations and applicable case law and we continue to believe that we are appropriately reserved for this matter

overview 

we are a world leader in connectivity we design and manufacture products to connect power data and signal in a broad array of industries including automotive energy industrial broadband communications consumer devices healthcare and aerospace and defense we help our customers solve the need for more energy efficiency alwayson communications and everincreasing productivity 

effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we reorganized our management and segments to align the organization around our strategy we now operate through four reporting segments transportation solutions network solutions industrial solutions and consumer solutions see notes 1 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our segments prior period segment results have been restated to conform to the current segment reporting structure 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions our sales are dependent on certain industry end markets that are impacted by 

consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending and our operating results can be affected by changes in demand in those markets 

overall our fiscal 2013 net sales and organic net sales were consistent with fiscal 2012 levels on an organic basis our sales into industrial and infrastructurebased markets declined primarily as a result of weakness in the subsea communications and data communications end markets in the network solutions segment and the industrial end market in the industrial solutions segment also on an organic basis our sales into consumerbased markets increased with growth in the automotive end market in the transportation solutions segment partially offset by declines in the consumer devices and appliances end markets in the consumer solutions segment 

overall our net sales decreased 36 in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 on an organic basis net sales decreased 27 in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 levels on an organic basis our sales into industrial and infrastructurebased markets decreased primarily as a result of weakness in the data communications subsea communications and telecom networks end markets in the network solutions segment and the industrial end market in the industrial solutions segment our sales into consumerbased markets experienced modest growth on an organic basis as growth in the automotive end market in the transportation solutions segment was partially offset by declines in the appliances and consumer devices end markets in the consumer solutions segment 

the acquisition of deutsch in april 2012 benefited the automotive and aerospace defense and marine end markets in the transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments respectively and contributed net sales of 327 million in fiscal 2012 also deutsch contributed incremental net sales of 320 million in the first six months of fiscal 2013 over the same period of fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed 267 million in net sales and 008 per share to diluted earnings per share adc which was acquired in december 2010 contributed net sales of 843 million of which 24 million related to the additional week during fiscal 2011 also the acquisition of adc resulted in incremental net sales of 154 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 over the same period of fiscal 2011 

the march 2011 earthquake subsequent tsunami and aftershocks in japan caused disruptions in our customers operations and the supply chains that support their operations we estimate that our fiscal 2011 net sales and diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by 99 million and 007 per share respectively as a result of these disruptions our facilities in japan were not materially damaged and we did not experience further negative impacts after 2011 

outlook 

we expect net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to be between 3225 billion and 3325 billion this reflects sales increases in the transportation solutions segment and to a lesser degree the industrial solutions segment partially offset by sales decreases in the consumer solutions and network solutions segments relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2013 in the transportation solutions segment we expect our sales to increase approximately 10 and we expect global automotive production to increase 3 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2013 in the industrial solutions segment we expect our sales to increase approximately 10 in the industrial end market with smaller increases in the aerospace defense and marine and energy end markets in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2013 in the consumer solutions segment we expect our sales to decline in the consumer devices end market with this decline partially offset by a modest increase in our sales in the appliances end market in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2013 in the network solutions segment we expect our sales to decline during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 reflecting continued weakness in the subsea communications and data communications end markets we expect this decline 

to be partially offset by sales increases in the telecom networks end market we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 071 to 075 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 

for fiscal 2014 we expect net sales to be between 1365 billion and 1415 billion reflecting expected sales increases in the transportation solutions and industrial solutions segments and to a lesser degree the consumer solutions segment from fiscal 2013 levels in the transportation solutions segment we expect our sales growth to exceed an anticipated increase in global automotive production of approximately 4 from fiscal 2013 levels in the industrial solutions segment we expect our sales to increase in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 levels in all end markets with growth primarily in the aerospace defense and marine end market due to strength in commercial aviation and oil and gas markets in the consumer solutions segment we expect a slight increase in our sales in the appliances end market in fiscal 2014 while our sales in the consumer devices end market are expected to be consistent with fiscal 2013 levels in the network solutions segment we expect our fiscal 2014 sales to be consistent with fiscal 2013 levels with increased sales in the telecom networks end market offset by decreased sales in the data communications end market we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 341 to 371 per share in fiscal 2014 

the above outlook is based on foreign exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels 

we are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve additionally we continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions we also are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources

restructuring 

we plan to continue to simplify our global manufacturing footprint by migrating facilities from highercost to lowercost countries consolidating within countries and transferring product lines to lowercost countries these initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry improve our operating leverage and position us for growth in the years ahead in connection with these initiatives and in response to market conditions we incurred net restructuring charges of 314 million during fiscal 2013 and expect to incur net restructuring charges of approximately 50 million during fiscal 2014 cash spending related to restructuring was 151 million during fiscal 2013 and we expect total spending which will be funded with cash from operations to be approximately 175 million in fiscal 2014 annualized cost savings related to these actions are expected to be approximately 115 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2015 cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses

we assessed the realization of adcs tax loss and credit carryforwards that we acquired in connection with our purchase of adc and we believe it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized on additional us federal and state net operating losses based upon the fiscal years 2011 through 2013 us operating results of the adc business under our management we reduced the valuation allowance provided at the date of acquisition and recorded a tax benefit of 63 million as of fiscal year end 2013 we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of 177 million related to us federal and state adc tax attributes due to the uncertainty of their realization in the future 

the tax provision for fiscal 2012 reflects an income tax benefit of 107 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss carryforwards in certain nonus locations in addition the tax provision for fiscal 2012 reflects 17 million of income tax expense associated with certain nonus tax rate changes enacted in the quarter ended december 30 2011

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 1816 million and 1719 million at fiscal year end 2013 and 2012 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss capital loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet the valuation allowance 

was calculated in accordance with the provisions of asc 740 income taxes  which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest furthermore management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement income tax benefits may be recognized 

we have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries earnings that are expected to be distributed in the future no additional provision has been made for swiss or nonswiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested the investments are essentially permanent in duration or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings as of september 27 2013 certain subsidiaries had approximately 18 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations including working capital property plant and equipment intangible assets and research and development activities a liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed it is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries as of september 27 2013 we had approximately 45 billion of cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits principally in our subsidiaries that we have the ability to distribute to tyco electronics group sa tegsa our luxembourg subsidiary which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt and to te connectivity ltd our swiss parent company but we consider to be permanently reinvested we estimate that up to approximately 15 billion of tax expense would be recognized on our consolidated financial statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations including investing and financing activities

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating investing and financing activities as reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows 



our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets money markets or other sources of funding as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements we believe that cash generated from operations and to the extent necessary these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future in october we called for early redemption all of our 595 senior notes due in january 2014 we may use excess cash to reduce our outstanding debt including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program to pay distributions or dividends on our common shares or to acquire strategic businesses or product lines the cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions we will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions 

as of september 27 2013 our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world under current applicable laws substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to tegsa our luxembourg subsidiary which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt and to te connectivity ltd our swiss parent company however the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax costs we provide for tax liabilities on our consolidated financial statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate however no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations as of september 27 2013 we had approximately 45 billion of cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits principally in our subsidiaries that we have the ability to distribute to tegsa our luxembourg subsidiary and te connectivity ltd our swiss parent company but we consider to be permanently reinvested we estimate that up to approximately 15 billion of tax expense would be recognized on our consolidated financial statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash cash equivalents and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations including investing and financing activities 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 2048 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to 1888 million in fiscal 2012 the increase of 160 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 resulted primarily from higher income levels 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 1888 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to 1722 million in fiscal 2011 the increase of 166 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 resulted primarily from improved working capital partially offset by lower income levels 

pension and postretirement benefit contributions in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 were 98 million 98 million and 90 million respectively we expect pension and postretirement benefit contributions to be 90 million in fiscal 2014 before consideration of any voluntary contributions there were no voluntary pension contributions in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 

the amount of income taxes paid net of refunds during fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 was 312 million 290 million and 299 million respectively

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities we use free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as a useful measure of our ability to generate cash free cash flow was 1500 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to 1434 million in fiscal 2012 and 1342 million in fiscal 2011 the increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by higher income levels partially offset by higher capital expenditures as reduced by proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment the increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by improved working capital as adjusted for net payments for preseparation tax matters and certain deutsch acquisitionrelated payments totaling 37 million partially offset by lower income levels 

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities the most comparable gaap financial measure to free cash flow 



cash flows from investing activities 

capital spending increased 82 million in fiscal 2013 to 615 million as compared to 533 million in fiscal 2012 capital spending was 574 million in fiscal 2011 we expect fiscal 2014 capital spending levels to be approximately 4 to 5 of net sales we believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities 

during fiscal 2012 we acquired deutsch the total value paid for the transaction amounted to €155 billion approximately 205 billion using an exchange rate of 133 per €100 net of cash acquired of 152 million the total value paid included 659 million of debt assumed including accrued interest which we paid off in its entirety shortly after the completion of the acquisition see additional information in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements

income tax matters 

in connection with our separation from tyco international in 2007 we entered into a tax sharing agreement that generally governs our tyco internationals and covidiens respective rights responsibilities and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes including ordinary course of 

business taxes and taxes if any incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of our shares or the shares of covidien to qualify as a taxfree distribution for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoffs to qualify for taxfavored treatment under the code 

pursuant to the tax sharing agreement upon separation we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and covidien under the tax sharing agreement we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters of tyco international the effect of the tax sharing agreement is to indemnify us for 69 of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved preseparation tax matters pursuant to that indemnification we have made similar indemnifications to tyco international and covidien with respect to 31 of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation we are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in addition tyco international and covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula 

prior to separation certain of our subsidiaries filed combined income tax returns with tyco international those and other of our subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments tyco international as the us income tax audit controlling party under the tax sharing agreement is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 which relate specifically to our entities have been recorded on the consolidated financial statements in addition we may be required to fund portions of tyco internationals and covidiens tax obligations estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the consolidated financial statements see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during fiscal 2007 the irs concluded its field examination of certain of tyco internationals us federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued revenue agent reports that reflected the irs determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period additionally the irs proposed civil fraud penalties against tyco international arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999 the penalties were asserted against a prior subsidiary of tyco international that was distributed to us in connection with the separation tyco international appealed certain of the proposed adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000 and tyco international resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments including reaching an agreement with the irs on the penalty adjustment in the amount of 21 million in october 2012 the irs issued special agreement forms 870ad effectively settling its audit of all tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000 excluding one issue that remains in dispute as described below as a result of these developments in fiscal 2013 we recognized an income tax benefit of 331 million and other expense of 231 million pursuant to the tax sharing agreement with tyco international and covidien 

the disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions the irs field examination asserted that certain intercompany loans originating during the period 1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for us federal income tax purposes and disallowed approximately 27 billion of related interest deductions recognized during the period on tyco internationals us income tax returns in addition if the irs is ultimately successful in asserting its claim it is likely to disallow an additional 66 billion of interest deductions reflected on us income tax returns in years subsequent to fiscal 2000 tyco international contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt 

for us tax purposes and that the interest deductions reflected on the income tax returns are appropriate the irs and tyco international were unable to resolve this matter through the irs appeals process on june 20 2013 tyco international advised us that it had received notices of deficiency from the irs for certain former us subsidiaries of tyco international increasing taxable income by approximately 29 billion in connection with the audit of tyco internationals fiscal years 1997 through 2000 the notices of deficiency assert that tyco international owes additional taxes totaling 778 million associated penalties of 154 million and withholding taxes of 105 million in addition tyco international received final partnership administrative adjustments for certain us partnerships owned by former us subsidiaries with respect to which tyco international estimates an additional tax deficiency of approximately 30 million will be asserted the amounts asserted by the irs exclude any applicable deficiency interest and do not reflect any impact to subsequent period tax liabilities in the event that the irs were to prevail on some or all of its assertions we understand that tyco international strongly disagrees with the irs position and has filed petitions in the us tax court contesting the irs proposed adjustments tyco international has advised us that it believes there are meritorious defenses for the tax filings in question and that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing treasury regulations 

resolution of this matter in the us tax court could take several years and no payments to the irs with respect to these matters would be required until the matter is fully and finally resolved in accordance with the terms of a tax sharing agreement we tyco international and covidien would share 31 27 and 42 respectively of any payments made in connection with these matters 

however as the ultimate outcome is uncertain and if the irs were to prevail on its assertions our share of the assessed tax deficiency interest and applicable withholding taxes and penalties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows we have reviewed the notices of deficiency the relevant facts surrounding the intercompany debt transactions relevant tax regulations and applicable case law and we continue to believe that we are appropriately reserved for this matter 

during fiscal 2013 and 2012 we made payments of 67 million and 70 million respectively for tax deficiencies related to undisputed tax adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000 concurrent with remitting these payments during fiscal 2013 and 2012 we were reimbursed 39 million and 51 million respectively from tyco international and covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for preseparation tax matters 

during fiscal 2011 the irs completed its field examination of certain tyco international income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 issued revenue agent reports which reflect the irs determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 2001 through 2004 period and issued certain notices of deficiency as a result of the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain tax matters in fiscal 2011 we recognized income tax benefits of 35 million and other expense of 14 million pursuant to the tax sharing agreement also in fiscal 2011 we made net cash payments of 154 million related to preseparation deficiencies 

tyco internationals income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 remain subject to adjustment by the irs upon ultimate resolution of the disputed issue involving certain intercompany loans originated during the period 1997 through 2000 the irs commenced its audit of certain tyco international income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011 and it is our understanding that fieldwork for this audit period is expected to be completed in fiscal 2014 also during fiscal 2012 the irs commenced its audit of our income tax returns for the years 2008 through 2010 we expect fieldwork for the 2008 through 2010 audit to conclude in fiscal 2014 over the next twelve months we expect to pay approximately 182 million inclusive of related indemnification payments in connection with preseparation tax matters 

at september 27 2013 and september 28 2012 we have reflected 15 million and 71 million respectively of income tax liabilities related to the audits of tyco internationals and our income tax returns in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within the next twelve months 

we believe that the amounts recorded on our consolidated financial statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate however the ultimate resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including patent infringement claims product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows however the proceedings discussed above in income tax matters could have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows see part i item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding legal proceedings 

at september 27 2013 we had a contingent purchase price commitment of 80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of comnet this represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of comnet only after the construction and installation of a communications system was completed for and approved by the state of florida in accordance with guidelines set forth in the contract under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers however the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in june 2006 in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania which is in the discovery phase a liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the consolidated financial statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable at this time 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in certain instances we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2014 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

at september 27 2013 we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of 376 million 

we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these liabilities 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance in the opinion of management such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

pursuant to the tax sharing agreement upon separation we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and covidien under the tax sharing agreement we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters of tyco international the effect of the tax sharing agreement is to indemnify us for 69 of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved preseparation tax matters pursuant to that indemnification we have made similar indemnifications to tyco international and covidien with respect to 31 of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation these arrangements have been valued upon our separation from tyco international in accordance with asc 460 and accordingly liabilities amounting to 223 million were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at september 27 2013 see notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are considered to be the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

revenue recognition 

our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with asc 605 revenue recognition  our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer this generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured for those items where title has not yet transferred we have deferred the recognition of revenue a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies a reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is also recorded as a reduction of sales 

contract revenues for construction related projects which are generated in the network solutions segment are recorded primarily using the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete percentageofcompletion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable in addition provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

acquired intangible assets include both indeterminablelived residual goodwill and determinablelived identifiable intangible assets intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents trademarks and unpatented technology as well as customer relationships estimates of recoverability range from 1 to 50 years and are generally amortized on a straightline basis an evaluation of the remaining useful life of determinablelived intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation we assess determinablelived intangible assets for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other longlived assets for impairment goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from determinablelived intangible assets by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred in assessing the existence of a triggering event management relies on a number of reportingunitspecific factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors to the goodwill impairment analysis 

a reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management at fiscal year end 2013 we had eight reporting units seven of which contained goodwill there is one reporting unit in the transportation solutions segment three reporting units in the network solutions segment and two reporting units in both the industrial solutions and consumer solutions segments we review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test or more frequently based on changes in our structure 

when testing for goodwill impairment we follow the guidance prescribed in asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  first we perform a step i goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment in doing so we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill may be impaired and a step ii goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment if any in the step ii goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 

fair value estimates used in the step i goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit the income approach generally has been supported by guideline analyses a market approach these approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates discount rates income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and determined that no impairment existed 

income taxes 

in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the 

determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and nonus pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings any changes in a valuation allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition will be reflected in the income tax provision 

changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 income taxes  we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest furthermore management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement income tax benefits may be recognized these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

pension and postretirement benefits 

our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions the funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date for defined benefit pension plans the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels for the postretirement benefit plans the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered the 

fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds held for the sole benefit of participants which are invested by the trustee of the funds the benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors such as years of service and compensation 

net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants 

two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and employee turnover these assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations at fiscal year end 2013 a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by 124 million a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by 112 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets would have increased or decreased respectively our fiscal 2013 pension expense by 10 million 

during fiscal 2012 our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the us plans master trust from a previous target of 30 equity and 70 fixed income to 10 equity and 90 fixed income in an effort to better protect the funded status of the us plans master trust asset reallocation will continue over a multiyear period based on the funded status as defined by the pension protection act of 2006 the pension act funded status of the us plans master trust and market conditions we expect to reach our target allocation when the pension act funded status exceeds 100 based on the pension act funded status as of september 27 2013 our target asset allocation is 45 equity and 55 fixed income 

acquisitions 

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting this method requires among other things that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values or as required by asc 805 business combinations  the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill we may engage independent thirdparty appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer and distributor relationships acquired developed technologies and patents expected costs to develop inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from projects when completed brand awareness and market position as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio customer and distributor attrition rates royalty rates and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

contingent liabilities 

we record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable when a range of possible losses with equal likelihood exists we record the low end of the range the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available in addition it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must continuously be evaluated to determine whether a loss is probable and a reasonable estimate of that loss can be made when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made or when a loss is at least reasonably possible disclosure is provided 

nongaap financial measures 

organic net sales growth 

organic net sales growth is a nongaap financial measure the difference between reported net sales growth the most comparable gaap measure and organic net sales growth the nongaap measure consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates acquisitions divestitures and an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business it excludes items that are not completely under managements control such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company such as acquisition and divestiture activity and the impact of an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length the impact of the 53 rd week was estimated using an average weekly sales figure for the last month of the fiscal year 

we believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business furthermore it provides investors with a view of our operations from managements perspective we use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations management uses organic net sales growth together with gaap measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations the discussion and analysis of organic net sales growth in results of operations above utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies organic net sales growth amounts presented above may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies organic net sales growth is a nongaap financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales this limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our gaap net sales the tables presented in results of operations above provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under gaap 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure the difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities the most comparable gaap measure and free cash flow the nongaap measure consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify free cash flow is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash it also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans we believe free cash flow provides useful information 

to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations 

free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items minus net capital expenditures net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment they are subtracted because they represent longterm commitments voluntary pension contributions are excluded from the gaap measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity certain special items including net payments related to preseparation tax matters also are considered by management in evaluating free cash flow we believe investors should also consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow 

free cash flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures reported by other companies the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our gaap cash flow also it subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within managements and the board of directors discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable gaap measure indicates this limitation is best addressed by using free cash flow in combination with the gaap cash flow results it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures as our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain nondiscretionary expenditures such as debt payments in addition we may have other discretionary expenditures such as discretionary dividends share repurchases and business acquisitions that are not considered in the calculation of free cash flow

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks 

we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an aa2 credit rating there is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty 

foreign currency exposures 

as part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we utilize foreign currency forward and swap contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our foreign currency forward or swap contracts from the september 27 2013 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our forward and swap 

contracts by 27 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our foreign currency forward or swap contracts from the september 28 2012 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our forward and swap contracts by 35 million such gains or losses on these contracts would be generally offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions 

interest rate and investment exposures 

we issue debt as needed to fund our operations and capital requirements such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure to manage the interest rate exposure we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixedrate debt into variablerate debt we use forward starting interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate swaps swaptions to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixedrate debt we also utilize investment swaps to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities 

during fiscal 2011 we entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on 150 million principal amount of the 4875 senior notes due 2021 the maturity dates of the interest rate swaps coincide with the maturity date of the notes under these contracts we receive fixed amounts of interest applicable to the underlying notes and pay a floating amount based upon the threemonth us dollar libor 

based on our floating rate debt balances of approximately 150 million at september 27 2013 and 200 million at september 28 2012 an increase in the levels of the us dollar interest rates by 05 with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately 1 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012 

commodity exposures 

our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges we continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts in order to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period at september 27 2013 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net loss position of 27 million and had a notional value of 278 million at september 28 2012 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold and silver were in a net gain position of 17 million and had a notional value of 246 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the september 27 2013 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 25 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold and a troy ounce of silver from the september 28 2012 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 26 million

sales marketing and distribution 

we sell our products into more than 150 countries and we sell primarily through direct selling efforts we also sell some of our products indirectly via thirdparty distributors in fiscal 2012 our direct sales represented 77 of net sales with the remainder of net sales provided by sales to thirdparty distributors and independent manufacturer representatives 

we maintain distribution centers around the world products are generally delivered to these distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer in some instances product is delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer we contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products via road rail sea and air 

seasonality and backlog 

customer orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business conditions and cancellation of unfilled orders prior to shipment of goods we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business the third fiscal quarter is typically the strongest quarter of our fiscal year whereas the first and fourth fiscal quarters are negatively affected by winter holidays and european holidays respectively the second fiscal quarter may also be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in certain of our end markets 

backlog by reportable segment at fiscal year end 2012 and 2011 was as follows 



we expect that the majority of our backlog at september 28 2012 will be filled during fiscal 2013 

competition 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers competition is generally on the basis of breadth of product offering product innovation price quality delivery and service our markets have generally been growing but with downward pressure on prices 

• transportation solutions this segment competes against numerous companies including delphi automotive molex amphenol fci yazaki sumitomo carlisle interconnect technologies esterline glenair and hellermanntyton • communications and industrial solutions this segment competes against numerous companies including molex jst connectors japan aviation electronics amphenol fci 3m and foxconn technology group • network solutions this segments major competitors include corning commscope 3m huawei technologies cooper industries and hubbell also the subsea communications business primarily competes against alcatellucent intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including patents and patent applications as available in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical optical and electronic products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks 

while we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents 

employees 

as of september 28 2012 we employed approximately 88000 people worldwide of whom 26000 were in the americas region 27000 were in the europemiddle eastafrica region and 35000 were in 

the asiapacific region of our total employees approximately 51000 were employed in manufacturing approximately 60 of our employees were based in lowercost countries primarily china we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 

government regulation and supervision 

the import and export of products are subject to regulation by the united states and other countries a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events we have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction 

environmental 

our operations are subject to numerous health safety and environmental laws and regulations including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment we are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment we maintain a global environmental health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards staff dedicated to environmental health and safety issues periodic compliance auditing training and other measures we have a program for compliance with the european union eu restriction of hazardous substances and waste electrical and electronics equipment directives the china restriction of hazardous substances law and similar laws 

compliance with these laws has in the past and may in the future increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways for example our costs may increase indirectly through increased energy and product costs as producers of energy cement iron steel pulp paper petroleum and other major emitters of greenhouse gases are subjected to increased or new regulation or legislation that results in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions we also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations based upon our experience current information and applicable laws we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 13 million to 23 million as of september 28 2012 we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately 14 million we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2013 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to risks that affect many other companies such as general economic conditions geopolitical events competition technological obsolescence labor relations natural disasters and international operations additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations financial condition and liquidity 

risks relating to our business 

  conditions in global or regional economies capital and money markets and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit end demand from consumer and industrial markets and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt and significant bank failures or defaults in the eurozone any of which could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow and ability to obtain financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full further our vendors may experience similar problems which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels if regional or global economic conditions deteriorate our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets periodic downturns in our customers industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a deterioration in economic conditions could trigger the recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other longlived assets impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position 

  we are dependent on the automotive industry 

approximately 39 of our net sales for fiscal 2012 were to customers in the automotive industry the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers additionally the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions as a supplier of automotive electronics products our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic and credit conditions and changes in the operations products business models partsourcing requirements financial condition and market share of automotive manufacturers as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers 

  we are dependent on the telecommunications computer and consumer electronics industries 

approximately 13 of our net sales for fiscal 2012 came from sales to the telecommunications industry the telecommunications industry has historically experienced periods of robust capital expenditure followed by periods of retrenchment and consolidation demand for these products is further subject to rapid technological change and has been and continues to be affected by declines in consumer and business spending additionally these markets are dominated by several large 

manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in the telecommunications industry and our inability to do so would materially impair our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

approximately 5 of our net sales for fiscal 2012 came from sales to the computer and consumer electronics industries demand for our computer and consumer electronics products depends on underlying business and consumer demand for computer and consumer electronics products as well as the market share of our customers demand has been and continues to be affected by reduced spending we cannot assure you that existing levels of business and consumer demand for new computer and consumer electronics products will not decrease 

  we encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry 

we operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology our ability to participate in emerging markets and customers expectations relating to socially responsible operations the competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large diversified manufacturers to small highly specialized manufacturers the electronic components industry has continued to become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities a number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products we cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue 

substantially all of the markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences which are rapid in certain end markets our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design develop introduce and sell new and innovative products to modify existing products and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change there are numerous risks inherent in these processes including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands 

  like other suppliers to the electronics industry we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices 

we have historically experienced and we expect to continue to experience continuing pressure to lower our prices in recent years we have experienced price erosion of approximately 1 each year in order to maintain our margins we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts we cannot assure you that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our results are sensitive to raw material availability quality and cost 

we are a large buyer of resin copper gold silver brass steel chemicals and additives zinc and other precious metals many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers in addition the price of 

many of these raw materials including gold and copper has increased in recent years and continues to fluctuate gold has recently traded at an alltime high in recent years we have only been able to partially offset these increases through higher selling prices our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are continued significant price increases for these raw materials any of these events could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials and to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers our margins may decline materially affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices the success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials we could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo drc as a result the sec established new annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the drc and adjoining countries in their products these requirements are effective for the calendar year beginning january 1 2013 the new requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement 

  foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue approximately 54 of our net sales for fiscal 2012 were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect nonus dollar revenue to represent a significant and likely increased portion of our future net revenue therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro or asian currencies our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage this risk in part by entering into financial derivative contracts in addition to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to these contracts our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful 

  we may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate 

many of the industries to which we sell our products as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials have become more concentrated in recent years including the automotive telecommunications computer and aerospace defense and marine industries consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us in addition as our customers buy in larger volumes their volume buying power has increased enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing these trends may adversely affect the profit margins on our products particularly for commodity components 

  the life cycles of our products can be very short 

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle as a result the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and 

from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment if we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  the deutsch group sas acquisition and future acquisitions may not be successful 

we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings in april 2012 we acquired deutsch group sas deutsch risks associated with the completed acquisition of deutsch include the risk that deutschs operations will not be integrated successfully into ours and the risk that revenue opportunities cost savings and other anticipated synergies from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected we cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with other acquisition candidates in the future we also cannot assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity 

if we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements this acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot assure you that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to make an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares 

  we could suffer significant business interruptions 

our operations and those of our suppliers and customers and the supply chains that supports their operations may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis typhoons or floods or other disasters such as fires explosions acts of terrorism or war disease or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes if a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events our business financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical managerial marketing finance and administrative personnel 

our success depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain key employees at our operations around the world we depend on highly skilled technical personnel to design manufacture and support our wide range of electronic components additionally we rely upon experienced managerial marketing and support personnel to manage our business effectively and to successfully promote our wide range of products any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the necessary global management technical human resource and financial skills to achieve our objectives may have adverse affects on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we may use components and products manufactured by third parties 

we may rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we may rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack 

sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if these third parties fail to deliver quality products parts and components on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

  our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology 

the electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights within this industry companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights depending on the importance of the technology product patent trademark or trade secret in question an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  a decline in the market value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

concerns about deterioration in the global economy together with concerns about credit inflation or deflation have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities including fixed income and equity securities which has and could further reduce the value of our pension plans investment portfolios in addition the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved a decrease in the value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding 

the global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit recent downgrades of credit ratings of sovereign debt including the us have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital as a result we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures the extent of any impact will depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions 

  divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered 

  if any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations our business may suffer 

our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the united states and the european union these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial including distribution agreements and practices with respect to the electrical components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we also may be subject to thirdparty claims for damages further agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable if we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements whether at all or in material part our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected further any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are subject to global risks of political economic and military instability 

our workforce manufacturing research administrative and sales facilities markets customers and suppliers are located throughout the world as a result we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including 

• tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes • regulations related to customs and importexport matters • variations in lengths of payment cycles • tax issues such as tax law changes examinations by taxing authorities variations in tax laws from country to country and difficulties in the taxefficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions • challenges in collecting accounts receivable • employment regulations and local labor conditions • difficulties protecting intellectual property • instability in economic or political conditions including sovereign debt levels eurozone uncertainty inflation recession and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts and • the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements we have sizeable operations in china including 17 manufacturing sites in addition 15 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 were made to customers in china the legal system in china is still developing and is subject to change accordingly our operations and orders for products in china could be adversely affected by changes to or interpretation of chinese law 

in addition standard  poors recent credit rating downgrade of longterm us sovereign debt any future downgrade by other rating agencies of longterm us sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions which could negatively affect our business financial condition and liquidity 

  we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk antibribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk antibribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making 

improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance program we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate these laws and regulations govern among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials • emissions or discharges of substances into the environment • investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites • greenhouse gas emissions and • the health and safety of our employees we may not have been or we may not at all times be in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators in addition environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain federal and state laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and similar environmental agencies that conditions at a number of formerlyowned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites 

while we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

  our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage hazardous material content and recycling 

the eu china and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal use of hazardous materials in products use of chemicals in manufacturing recycling of products at the end of 

their useful life and other related matters these laws include the eu restriction of hazardous substances end of life vehicle and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the eu reach chemical registration directive the china law on management methods for controlling pollution by electronic information products and various other laws these laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes registration chemical testing labeling and other matters these laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale these laws could make manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions 

  we are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business we are a defendant in litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights anticompetitive behavior product liability breach of contract and employmentrelated claims in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our bank credit facility contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt as defined in the credit facility to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as defined in the credit facility and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens our outstanding notes indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate merge and sell assets 

although none of these covenants is presently restrictive to our operations our continued ability to meet the bank credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant a breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our bank credit facility if the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder 

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

risks relating to our separation from tyco international 

  we share responsibility for certain of our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date 

in connection with our separation from tyco international in 2007 we tyco international and its former healthcare businesses covidien entered into a tax sharing agreement under which we share responsibility for certain of our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of us income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our tyco internationals and covidiens us income tax returns certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation all costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties we are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in addition tyco international and covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula 

all of the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from tyco international became our tax liabilities although we have agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with tyco international and covidien pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities if tyco international and covidien default on their obligations to us under the tax sharing agreement we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities 

if any party to the tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our tyco internationals and covidiens tax liabilities 

our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities in connection with such examinations tax authorities including the us internal revenue service irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments we are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that we have assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of accounting standards codification asc 740 income taxes  have been reflected as liabilities on the consolidated financial statements the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest 

under the tax sharing agreement tyco international has the right to administer control and settle all us income tax audits for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 the timing nature and amount of any settlement agreed to by tyco international may not be in our best interests moreover the other parties to the tax sharing agreement will be able to remove tyco international as 

the controlling party only under limited circumstances including a change of control or bankruptcy of tyco international or by a majority vote of the parties on or after the second anniversary of the distribution all other tax audits will be administered controlled and settled by the party that would be responsible for paying the tax 

  if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

tyco international received private letter rulings from the irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution of our common shares and covidien common shares to the tyco international shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of our common shares and the covidien common shares will qualify as taxfree under sections 368a1d and 355 of the internal revenue code the code the private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the private letter rulings tyco international obtained opinions from outside legal counsel confirming the taxfree status of the distribution and certain internal transactions the private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us tyco international and covidien regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable tyco international would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common shares and covidien common shares distributed to tyco international shareholders on the distribution date over tyco internationals tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however we would incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation should be treated as taxable transactions 

in addition under the terms of the tax sharing agreement in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the distribution by us tyco international or covidien the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us tyco international or covidien as a result thereof if such determination is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us tyco international or covidien then we tyco international or covidien would be responsible for 31 27 and 42 respectively of any taxes imposed on us tyco international or covidien as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant in the event that any party to the tax sharing agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting partys obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other partys taxes 

risks relating to our swiss jurisdiction of incorporation 

  legislative and other proposals in switzerland the united states and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

various us and nonus legislative proposals and other initiatives have been directed at companies incorporated in lowertax jurisdictions we believe that recently there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and other initiatives as various jurisdictions look for solutions to fiscal deficits if adopted these proposed changes could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives and we cannot assure you that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us 

  legislation in the united states could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to us companies that have moved to lowertax jurisdictions 

we expect the us congress to continue to consider implementation andor expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad we believe that we are less likely to be subject to such proposals since becoming a swiss corporation in june 2009 however we cannot predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals therefore we cannot assure you that any such legislative action will not apply to us in addition we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to us federal or state governments or the willingness of our nongovernmental customers to do business with us as a result of these uncertainties we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot assure you that the impact will not be materially adverse to us 

  as a swiss corporation we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares 

as a swiss corporation our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements our articles of association allow us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors but this authorization is limited to i authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years which authorization period ends on march 9 2013 and ii conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation dividends andor voting moreover under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convene a meeting of shareholders which would delay 

the timing to execute such actions such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management while we do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us we cannot assure you that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors 

  swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

we are organized under the laws of switzerland it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us and switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws would not be allowed in swiss courts as they are contrary to that nations public policy 

swiss corporate law which applies to us differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers thus holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

risks relating to our shares 

  the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors including 

• our quarterly or annual earnings • changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results • volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global economic conditions and investors concerns about potential risks to future economic growth • changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates • changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles • announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions and • the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business   we might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

in order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of swiss withholding tax we anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes or registered share capital various tax law and 

corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes or through a reduction of registered share capital or that swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

under swiss corporate law we are required to state our year end unconsolidated swiss statutory financial statements in swiss francs although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in us dollars shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions are required to be stated in swiss francs if the us dollar were to increase in value relative to the swiss franc the us dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without swiss withholding tax will decrease 

  we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares 

the swiss code of obligations regulates a corporations ability to hold or repurchase its own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation additionally various tax law and corporate law proposals in switzerland if passed in the future may affect our ability to repurchase our shares our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings 

our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by swiss law for swiss companies like us that issue registered shares as opposed to bearer shares this provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights holders of our shares must be registered in our share register aktienbuch as shareholders with voting rights only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders meetings but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends distributions preemptive rights advance subscription rights and liquidation proceeds the board of directors may in its discretion refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association additionally various proposals in switzerland for corporate law changes if passed in the future may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and banks such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable 

our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered antitakeover provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors under these provisions among others 

• shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent and • restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15 or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors these provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital in either case representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in the case of issuances from authorized capital until march 9 2013 unless reauthorized by shareholders for a subsequent twoyear period without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders preemptive rights or advance subscription rights for the purpose of the defense of an actual threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid in relation to which the board of directors upon consultation with an independent financial advisor has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders we note that swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital in addition the new york stock exchange on which our shares are listed requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power with limited exceptions

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax in addition we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims at any given time in the ordinary course of business we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions if infringement of a third partys patent were to be determined against us we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products if a patent owned by or licensed to us were 

determined to be invalid or unenforceable we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge which could be significant in amount 

at september 28 2012 we had a contingent purchase price commitment of 80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of comnet this represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of comnet only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the state of florida was completed and approved by the state of florida in accordance with guidelines set forth in the contract under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers however the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in june 2006 in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania which is in the discovery phase a liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the consolidated financial statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or reasonably estimable at this time 

management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

income tax matter 

during fiscal 2007 the irs concluded its field examination of certain of tyco internationals us federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued revenue agent reports which reflect the irs determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period additionally the irs proposed civil fraud penalties against tyco international arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999 the penalties were asserted against a prior subsidiary of tyco international that was distributed to us in connection with the separation tyco international appealed certain of the proposed adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000 and tyco international has now resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments including reaching an agreement with the irs on the penalty adjustment in october 2012 the irs issued special agreement forms 870ad concluding its audit of all tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000 excluding one issue that remains in dispute as described below 

the disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions the irs has asserted that certain intercompany loans originating during the period 1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for us federal income tax purposes and has disallowed related interest deductions recognized on tyco internationals us income tax returns during the period tyco international contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt for us tax purposes and that the interest deductions reflected on the income tax returns are appropriate the irs and tyco international remain unable to resolve this matter through the irs appeals process we understand that tyco international expects to receive statutory notices of deficiency from the irs early in our fiscal 2013 upon receipt of these statutory notices we expect that tyco international will commence litigation of this matter with the irs in us federal court based upon relevant facts surrounding the intercompany debt transactions relevant tax regulations and applicable case law we believe that we are adequately reserved for this matter however the ultimate outcome is uncertain and if the irs were to prevail on its assertions our share of the assessed tax deficiency interest and applicable withholding taxes and penalties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position

overview 

we are a global company that designs and manufactures approximately 500000 products that connect and protect the flow of power and data inside millions of products used by consumers and industries we partner with customers in a broad array of industries from consumer electronics energy and healthcare to automotive aerospace and communication networks 

we operate through three reporting segments transportation solutions communications and industrial solutions and network solutions see notes 1 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our segments 

we service our customers primarily through our direct sales force that serves customers in over 150 countries the sales force is supported by approximately 7400 engineers as well as globally deployed manufacturing sites through our sales force and engineering resources we are able to collaborate with our customers throughout the world to provide highly engineered products and solutions to meet their needs 

our strategic objective is to increase our net sales and profitability across our segments in the markets we serve this strategy is dependent upon the following strategic priorities 

• deliver extraordinary customer service • strengthen our innovation leadership • extend our leadership in emerging markets • lead in smart connectivity and • supplement organic growth with strategic partnerships and acquisitions our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions our sales are dependent on certain industry end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending and our operating results can be affected by changes in demand in those markets overall our net sales decreased 36 in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 on an organic basis net sales decreased 27 in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 levels on an organic basis we experienced declines in our sales into industrial and infrastructure based markets primarily as a result of weakness in the industrial and data communications end markets in our communications and industrial solutions segment and telecom networks and subsea communications end markets in our network solutions segment on an organic basis we experienced modest growth in our sales into consumer based markets as growth in the automotive end market in our transportation solutions segment was partially offset by declines within the consumer devices and appliance end markets in our communications and industrial solutions segment 

the acquisition of deutsch in april 2012 benefited the automotive and aerospace defense and marine end markets in the transportation solutions segment and contributed net sales of 327 million in fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed 267 million in net sales and 008 per share to diluted earnings per share adc which was acquired in december 2010 contributed net sales of 843 million of which 24 million related to the additional week during fiscal 2011 also the acquisition of adc resulted in incremental net sales of 154 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 over the same period of fiscal 2011 

the march 2011 earthquake subsequent tsunami and aftershocks in japan caused disruptions in our customers operations and the supply chains that support their operations we estimate that our fiscal 2011 net sales and diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by 99 million and 007 per share respectively as a result of these disruptions our facilities in japan were not materially damaged and we did not experience further negative impacts in fiscal 2012 

outlook 

net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 are expected to be between 315 billion and 325 billion we expect global automotive production in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be comparable to first quarter fiscal 2012 levels our sales into the automotive and aerospace defense and marine end markets will benefit from incremental deutsch sales which are expected to be approximately 150 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we expect continued weakness in the industrial energy and appliance end markets also we expect results in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be negatively impacted by lower spending for broadband networks equipment and lower levels of project activity in the subsea communications end market in the first fiscal quarter of 2013 we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 043 to 047 per share 

for fiscal 2013 we expect net sales to be between 134 billion and 140 billion reflecting expected sales increases in the automotive and aerospace defense and marine end markets offset by continued weakness in the industrial appliance and energy end markets our sales into the automotive 

and aerospace defense and marine end markets will benefit from incremental deutsch sales during the first half of fiscal 2013 we expect global automotive production and broadband network spending in fiscal 2013 to remain flat at fiscal 2012 levels we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 261 to 291 per share 

the above outlook is based on foreign exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels 

we are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve additionally we continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions we are also managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources

the acquisition was made to accelerate our growth potential in the global broadband connectivity market the combined organization offers a complete product portfolio across every major geographic 

market it also added adcs distributed antenna system products which expanded our wireless connectivity portfolio to provide greater mobile coverage and capacity solutions to carrier and enterprise customers as demand for mobile data continues to expand we realized cost savings and other synergies through operational efficiencies including the consolidation of manufacturing marketing and general and administrative functions the acquired adc businesses have been included in the network solutions segment from the date of acquisition

restructuring 

we continue to streamline our operations and simplify our global manufacturing footprint by migrating facilities from highercost to lowercost countries consolidating within countries and transferring product lines to lowercost countries these initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry improve our operating leverage and position us for profitability growth in the years ahead in connection with these initiatives we incurred restructuring charges of approximately 127 million during fiscal 2012 including 14 million associated with the acquisition of deutsch in fiscal 2012 cash spending related to restructuring was 137 million including 7 million associated with the acquisition of deutsch 

in response to a weaker than expected economic environment we are expanding our restructuring efforts and expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately 200 million during fiscal 2013 annualized cost savings related to these actions are expected to be approximately 75 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2015 cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses 

in fiscal 2013 we expect total spending which will be funded with cash from operations to be approximately 150 million related to restructuring actions

income taxes 

our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world we have provided for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation 

our effective income tax rate was 176 for fiscal 2012 and reflects income tax benefits recognized in connection with profitability in certain entities operating in lower tax rate jurisdictions in addition the provision for fiscal 2012 reflects an income tax benefit of 107 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss carryforwards in certain nonus locations partially offset by accruals of interest related to uncertain tax positions 

our effective income tax rate was 220 for fiscal 2011 and reflects income tax benefits recognized in connection with profitability in certain entities operating in lower tax rate jurisdictions partially offset by accruals of interest related to uncertain tax positions in addition the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflects income tax benefits of 35 million associated with the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain us tax matters

was calculated in accordance with the provisions of asc 740 which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest further management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement income tax benefits may be recognized

commitments and contingencies 

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable leases and other obligations at fiscal year end 2012 



1 interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps 2 purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services 3 the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of 1795 million and related accrued interest and penalties of 1335 million the timing of which is uncertain see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits interest and penalties 4 the table above does not reflect pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees we are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans however we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type including timing interest rate charges investment performance and amounts of benefit payments we expect to contribute 103 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2013 before consideration of voluntary contributions 

these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

5 other longterm liabilities of 517 million of which 227 million related to our asc 460 guarantee liabilities are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding asc 460 

income tax matters 

in connection with the separation we entered into a tax sharing agreement that generally governs our covidiens and tyco internationals respective rights responsibilities and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes if any incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of our shares or the shares of covidien to qualify as a taxfree distribution for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoffs to qualify for taxfavored treatment under the code 

pursuant to the tax sharing agreement upon separation we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and covidien under the tax sharing agreement we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters of tyco international the effect of the tax sharing agreement is to indemnify us for 69 of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved preseparation tax matters pursuant to that indemnification we have made similar indemnifications to tyco international and covidien with respect to 31 of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation we are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in addition tyco international and covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula 

prior to separation certain of our subsidiaries filed combined income tax returns with tyco international those and other of our subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments tyco international as the us income tax audit controlling party under the tax sharing agreement is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 which relate specifically to our entities have been recorded on the consolidated financial statements in addition we may be required to fund portions of covidien and tyco internationals tax obligations estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the consolidated financial statements see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during fiscal 2007 the irs concluded its field examination of certain of tyco internationals us federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued revenue agent reports which reflect the irs determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period additionally the irs proposed civil fraud penalties against tyco international arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999 the penalties were asserted against a prior subsidiary of tyco international that was distributed to us in connection with the separation tyco international appealed certain of the proposed adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000 and tyco international has now resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments including reaching an agreement with the irs on the penalty adjustment in october 2012 the irs issued special agreement forms 870ad concluding its audit of all tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000 excluding one issue that remains in dispute as described below 

the disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions the irs has asserted that certain intercompany loans originating during the period 1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for us federal income tax purposes and has disallowed related interest deductions recognized on tyco internationals us income tax returns during the period tyco international contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt for us tax purposes and that the interest deductions reflected on the income tax returns are appropriate the irs and tyco international remain unable to resolve this matter through the irs appeals process we understand that tyco international expects to receive statutory notices of deficiency from the irs early in our fiscal 2013 upon receipt of these statutory notices we expect that tyco international will commence litigation of this matter with the irs in us federal court based upon relevant facts surrounding the intercompany debt transactions relevant tax regulations and applicable case law we believe that we are adequately reserved for this matter however the ultimate outcome is uncertain and if the irs were to prevail on its assertions our share of the assessed tax deficiency interest and applicable withholding taxes and penalties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in fiscal 2012 we made payments of 70 million for tax deficiencies related to undisputed tax adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000 concurrent with remitting these payments we were reimbursed 51 million from tyco international and covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for preseparation tax matters over the next twelve months we expect to pay approximately 26 million inclusive of related indemnification payments in connection with these preseparation tax matters 

during fiscal 2011 the irs completed its field examination of certain tyco international income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 issued revenue agent reports which reflect the irs determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 2001 through 2004 period and issued certain notices of deficiency as a result of the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain tax matters in fiscal 2011 we recognized income tax benefits of 35 million and other expense of 14 million pursuant to the tax sharing agreement also in fiscal 2011 we made net cash payments of 154 million related to preseparation deficiencies tyco internationals income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 remain subject to adjustment by the irs upon ultimate resolution of the disputed issue involving certain intercompany loans originated during the period 1997 through 2000 

the irs commenced its audit of certain tyco international income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011 

during fiscal 2012 the irs commenced its audit of our income tax returns for the years 2008 through 2010 

at september 28 2012 and september 30 2011 we have reflected 71 million and 232 million respectively of income tax liabilities related to the audits of tyco internationals and our income tax returns in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within the next twelve months 

we continue to believe that the amounts recorded on our consolidated financial statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate however the ultimate resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

legal matters 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including patent infringement claims product liability matters employment disputes disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters antitrust claims and tax matters including nonincome tax matters such as value added tax sales and use tax real estate tax and transfer tax management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings 

based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows see part i item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding legal proceedings 

at september 28 2012 we had a contingent purchase price commitment of 80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of comnet this represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of comnet only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the state of florida was completed and approved by the state of florida in accordance with guidelines set forth in the contract under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers however the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in june 2006 in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania which is in the discovery phase a liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the consolidated financial statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or reasonably estimable at this time 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

certain of our segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2013 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

at september 28 2012 we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of 344 million 

we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these liabilities 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance in the opinion of management such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

pursuant to the tax sharing agreement upon separation we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and covidien under the tax sharing agreement we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters of tyco international the effect of the tax sharing agreement is to indemnify us for 69 of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved preseparation tax matters pursuant to that indemnification we have made similar indemnifications to tyco international and covidien with respect to 31 of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation these arrangements have been valued upon our separation from tyco international in accordance with asc 460 and accordingly liabilities amounting to 241 million were recorded on 

the consolidated balance sheet at september 28 2012 see notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are considered to be the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

revenue recognition 

our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with asc 605 revenue recognition  our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer this generally occurs when the products reach the freeonboard shipping point the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured for those items where title has not yet transferred we have deferred the recognition of revenue a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies a reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales 

contract revenues for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete percentageofcompletion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable in addition provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable contract revenues for construction related projects are generated primarily in the network solutions segment 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

acquired intangible assets include both indeterminablelived residual goodwill and determinablelived identifiable intangible assets intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents trademarks customer and distributor relationships and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 1 to 50 years amortized generally on a straightline basis an evaluation of the remaining useful life of determinablelived intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation we assess determinablelived intangible assets for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other longlived assets for impairment goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from determinablelived intangible assets by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred in assessing the existence of a triggering event management relies on a number of reportingunitspecific factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors to the goodwill impairment analysis 

a reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management at september 28 2012 we had eight reporting units consisting of two units in the transportation solutions segment three units in the communications and industrial solutions segment and three units in the network solutions segment of which one reporting unit has no goodwill we review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test or more frequently based on changes in our structure 

when testing for goodwill impairment we follow the guidance prescribed in asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  first we perform a step i goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment in doing so we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill may be impaired and a step ii goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss in the step ii goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 

fair value estimates used in the step i goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit the income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction and guideline analyses these approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates discount rates income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and determined that no impairment existed 

income taxes 

in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and nonus pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may 

require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings any changes in a valuation allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition will be reflected in the income tax provision 

changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 income taxes  we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest further management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement income tax benefits may be recognized these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 

pension and postretirement benefits 

our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions the funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date for defined benefit pension plans the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels for the postretirement benefit plans the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered the fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds held for the sole benefit of participants which are invested by the trustee of the funds the benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors such as years of service and compensation 

net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants 

two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and employee turnover these assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations at fiscal year end 2012 a 25 basis point decrease in the 

discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by 135 million a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by 121 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets would have increased or decreased respectively our fiscal 2012 pension expense by 9 million 

during fiscal 2012 our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the us plans master trust from 30 equity and 70 fixed income to 10 equity and 90 fixed income in an effort to better protect the funded status of the us plans master trust asset reallocation will continue over a multiyear period based on the funded status of the us plans master trust and market conditions we expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the us plans master trust as determined by the pension protection act of 2006 the pension act will be over 100 based on the pension act definition of funded status our target asset allocation is 35 equity and 65 fixed income at september 28 2012 

acquisitions 

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting this method requires among other things that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values or as required by asc 805 the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill we may engage independent thirdparty appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer and distributor relationships acquired developed technologies and patents expected costs to develop inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from projects when completed brand awareness and market position as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio customer and distributor attrition rates royalty rates and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

contingent liabilities 

we record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable when a range of possible losses with equal likelihood exists we record the low end of the range the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available in addition it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must continuously be evaluated to determine whether a loss is probable and a reasonable estimate of that loss can be made when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made or when a loss is at least reasonably possible disclosure is provided 

accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in december 2011 and june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updates to guidance in asc 220 comprehensive income  that change the presentation and disclosure requirements of comprehensive income in interim and annual financial statements these updates to asc 220 are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 however we early adopted these updates during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we now present consolidated statements of comprehensive income separately in our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued an update to guidance in asc 820 fair value measurement  that clarifies the application of fair value and enhances disclosure regarding valuation of financial instruments and level 3 fair value measurement inputs we adopted these updates to asc 820 in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

organic net sales growth 

organic net sales growth is a nongaap financial measure the difference between reported net sales growth the most comparable gaap measure and organic net sales growth the nongaap measure consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates acquisitions divestitures and an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business it excludes items that are not completely under managements control such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company such as acquisition and divestiture activity and the impact of an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length the impact of the 53 rd week was estimated using an average weekly sales figure for the last month of the fiscal year 

we believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business furthermore it provides investors with a view of our operations from managements perspective we use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations management uses organic net sales growth together with gaap measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations the discussion and analysis of organic net sales growth in results of operations above utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies organic net sales growth amounts presented above may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies organic net sales growth is a nongaap financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales this limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our gaap net sales the tables presented in results of operations above provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under gaap 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure the difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities the most comparable gaap measure and free cash flow the 

nongaap measure consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify free cash flow is a useful measure of our performance and ability to generate cash it also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans we believe free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations 

free cash flow excludes net capital expenditures voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items net capital expenditures are subtracted because they represent longterm commitments voluntary pension contributions are subtracted from the gaap measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity certain special items including net payments related to preseparation tax matters and preseparation litigation payments are also considered by management in evaluating free cash flow we believe investors should also consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow 

free cash flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures reported by other companies the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our gaap cash flow also it subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within managements and the board of directors discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable gaap measure indicates this limitation is best addressed by using free cash flow in combination with the gaap cash flow results it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures as our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain nondiscretionary expenditures such as debt payments in addition we may have other discretionary expenditures such as discretionary dividends share repurchases and business acquisitions that are not considered in the calculation of free cash flow 

the tables presented in liquidity and capital resources above provide reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from continuing operating activities calculated under gaap

the following and other risks which are described in greater detail in part i item 1a risk factors as well as other risks described in this annual report could also cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements 

• conditions in the global or regional economies and global capital markets and cyclical industry conditions • conditions affecting demand for products in the industries we serve particularly the automotive industry and the telecommunications computer and consumer electronics industries 63 

• competition and pricing pressure • market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations and product life cycles • raw material availability quality and cost • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates • financial condition and consolidation of customers and vendors • reliance on thirdparty suppliers • our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel • risks associated with our acquisition of deutsch • risks associated with future acquisitions and divestitures • global risks of business interruptions such as natural disasters and political economic and military instability • risks related to compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations • our ability to protect our intellectual property rights • risks of litigation • our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by our debt instruments • risks relating to our separation on june 29 2007 from tyco international ltd • the possible effects on us of various us and nonus legislative proposals and other initiatives that if adopted could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate and negatively impact our us government contracts business • various risks associated with being a swiss corporation • the impact of fluctuations in the market price of our shares and • the impact of certain provisions of our articles of association on unsolicited takeover proposals there may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks 

we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an aa2 credit rating there is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty 

foreign currency exposures 

as part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we utilize foreign currency forward and swap contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges the 

objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany transactions accounts receivable accounts payable and other cash transactions a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our foreign currency forward or swap contracts from the september 28 2012 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our forward and swap contracts by 35 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our foreign currency forward or swap contracts from the september 30 2011 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our forward and swap contracts by 20 million such gains or losses on these contracts would be generally offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions 

interest rate and investment exposures 

we issue debt from time to time to fund our operations and capital needs such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure to manage the interest rate exposure we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixedrate debt into variablerate debt we use forward starting interest rate swaps and swaptions to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixedrate debt we also utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities 

during fiscal 2011 we entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on 150 million principal amount of the 4875 senior notes due 2021 the maturity dates of the interest rate swaps coincide with the maturity date of the notes under these contracts we receive fixed amounts of interest applicable to the underlying notes and pay a floating amount based upon the three month us dollar libor 

during fiscal 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge on 50 million principal amount of the 600 senior notes due 2012 the maturity date of the interest rate swaps coincides with the maturity date of the underlying debt under this contract we receive fixed rates of interest applicable to the underlying debt and pay floating rates of interest based on the one month us dollar libor 

based on our floating rate debt balances of approximately 200 million at september 28 2012 and september 30 2011 an increase in the levels of the us dollar interest rates by 05 with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately 1 million 

commodity exposures 

our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows we utilize cash flow hedgedesignated commodity swap contracts we continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts in order to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period at september 28 2012 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold silver and copper were in a net gain position of 17 million and had a notional value of 246 million at september 30 2011 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold and silver were in a net loss position of 1 million and had a notional value of 211 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold a troy ounce of silver and a pound of copper from the september 28 2012 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 26 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold and a troy ounce of silver from the september 30 2011 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 21 million

our research development and engineering efforts are supported by approximately 7500 engineers these engineers work closely with our customers to develop application specific highly engineered products and systems to satisfy the customers needs our new products including product extensions introduced during the previous three years comprised approximately 25 of our net sales for fiscal 2011 

sales marketing and distribution 

we sell our products into more than 150 countries and we sell primarily through direct selling efforts we also sell some of our products indirectly via thirdparty distributors in fiscal 2011 our direct sales represented 78 of net sales with the remainder of net sales provided by sales to thirdparty distributors and independent manufacturer representatives 

we maintain distribution centers around the world products are generally delivered to these distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer in some instances product is delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer we contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products via road rail sea and air 

seasonality and backlog 

customer orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business conditions and because unfilled orders may be canceled prior to shipment of goods we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business the third fiscal quarter is typically the strongest quarter of our fiscal year while the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by winter holidays and the fourth fiscal quarter is negatively affected by european holidays the second fiscal quarter may also be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in certain of our end markets 

backlog by reportable segment at fiscal year end 2011 and 2010 was as follows 



we expect that the majority of our backlog at september 30 2011 will be filled during fiscal 2012 

competition 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers competition is generally on the basis of breadth of product offering product innovation price quality delivery and service our markets have generally been growing but with downward pressure on prices 

• transportation solutions this segment competes against numerous companies including delphi automotive molex amphenol fci yazaki sumitomo carlisle interconnect technologies esterline glenair and hellermanntyton • communications and industrial solutions this segment competes against numerous companies including molex jst connectors japan aviation electronics amphenol fci 3m and foxconn technology group • network solutions this segments major competitors include corning commscope 3m huawei technologies thomas  betts and hubbell also the subsea communications business primarily competes against alcatellucent intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including patents and patent applications as available in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical optical and electronic products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks 

while we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents 

employees 

as of september 30 2011 we employed approximately 95000 people worldwide of whom 29000 were in the americas region 26000 were in the europemiddle eastafrica region and 40000 were in 

the asiapacific region of our total employees approximately 58000 were employed in manufacturing approximately 65 of our employees were based in lowercost countries primarily china we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 

government regulation and supervision 

the import and export of products are subject to regulation by the united states and other countries a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events we have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction 

environmental 

our operations are subject to numerous health safety and environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment we are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment we maintain a global environmental health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards staff dedicated to environmental health and safety issues periodic compliance auditing training and other measures we have a program for compliance with the european union eu restriction of hazardous substances and waste electrical and electronics equipment directives the china restriction of hazardous substances law and similar laws 

compliance with these laws has in the past and may in the future increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways for example our costs may increase indirectly through increased energy and product costs as producers of energy cement iron steel pulp paper petroleum and other major emitters of greenhouse gases are subjected to increased or new regulation or legislation that results in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions we also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations based upon our experience current information and applicable laws we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 12 million to 24 million as of september 30 2011 we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately 13 million we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2012 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to risks that affect many other companies such as general economic conditions geopolitical events competition technological obsolescence labor relations natural disasters and international operations additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations financial condition and liquidity 

risks relating to our business 

  conditions in global or regional economies capital and money markets and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or worldwide including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit end demand from consumer and industrial markets and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt any of which could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow and ability to obtain financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full further our vendors may experience similar problems which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels if regional or global economic conditions deteriorate our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets for example the automotive industry which accounted for approximately 34 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 has experienced a significant downturn in recent years as described below the telecommunications industry which accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 has historically experienced periods of robust capital expenditure followed by periods of retrenchment and consolidation the aerospace defense and marine industry which accounted for 5 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 has undergone significant fluctuations in demand depending on worldwide economic and political conditions periodic downturns in our customers industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are dependent on the automotive industry which has experienced significant declines in recent years 

approximately 34 of our net sales for fiscal 2011 were to customers in the automotive industry in recent years automotive manufacturers globally have experienced lower levels of vehicle sales as a result of the 2009 economic downturn and credit conditions fiscal 2009 and 2010 sales levels were below fiscal 2008 levels in fiscal 2011 sales increased and improved relative to prior years to reach fiscal 2008 levels additionally the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers as a supplier of automotive electronics products our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by changes in the operations products business models partsourcing requirements financial condition and market share of automotive manufacturers as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers 

  we are dependent on the telecommunications computer and consumer electronics industries 

approximately 14 of our net sales for fiscal 2011 came from sales to the telecommunications industry demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change and was and remains 

affected by declines in consumer and business spending additionally these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in the telecommunications industry and our inability to do so would materially impair our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

approximately 8 of our net sales for fiscal 2011 came from sales to the computer and consumer electronics industries demand for our computer and consumer electronics products depends on underlying business and consumer demand for computer and consumer electronics products as well as the market share of our customers demand was and remains affected by reduced spending we cannot assure you that existing levels of business and consumer demand for new computer and consumer electronics products will not decrease 

  we encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry 

we operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price quality and performance of our products the level of customer service the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets the competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large diversified manufacturers to small highly specialized manufacturers the electronic components industry has continued to become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities a number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products we cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue 

substantially all of the markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences which are rapid in certain end markets our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design develop introduce and sell new and innovative products to modify existing products and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change there are numerous risks inherent in these processes including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands 

  like other suppliers to the electronics industry we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices 

we have historically experienced and we expect to continue to experience continuing pressure to lower our prices in recent years we have experienced price erosion averaging from 1 to 2 in order to maintain our margins we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts we cannot assure you that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our results are sensitive to raw material availability quality and cost 

we are a large buyer of resin copper gold silver brass steel chemicals and additives zinc and other precious metals many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries 

around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers in addition the price of many of these raw materials including gold and copper has increased in recent years and continues to fluctuate gold has recently traded at an alltime high in recent years we have only been able to partially offset these increases through higher selling prices our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are continued significant price increases for these raw materials any of these events could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials and to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers our margins may decline materially affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices the success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials we could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the conflict zones of the drc as a result the sec is required to establish new annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the drc and adjoining countries in their products when these new requirements are implemented they could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement 

  foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue approximately 55 of our net sales for fiscal 2011 were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect nonus dollar revenue to represent a significant and likely increased portion of our future net revenue therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro or asian currencies our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage this risk in part by entering into financial derivative contracts in addition to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to these contracts our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful 

  we may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate 

many of the industries to which we sell our products as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials have become more concentrated in recent years including the automotive telecommunications computer and aerospace defense and marine industries consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us in addition as our customers buy in larger volumes their volume buying power has increased and they have been able to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing these trends may adversely affect the profit margins on our products particularly for commodity components 

  the life cycles of our products can be very short 

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle as a result the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment if we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses our results of operations financial position and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected 

  the adc telecommunications inc acquisition and future acquisitions may not be successful 

in december 2010 we acquired adc telecommunications inc adc and we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings risks associated with the completed acquisition of adc include the risk that we do not fully integrate adc successfully and the risk that revenue opportunities cost savings and other anticipated synergies from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected we also cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with other acquisition candidates in the future nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity 

if we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements this acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot assure you that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to undertake an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares 

  we could suffer significant business interruptions 

our operations and those of our suppliers and customers and the supply chain that supports their operations may be vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis typhoons or floods or other disasters such as fires explosions acts of terrorism or war disease or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes if a business interruption occurs our business financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

on march 11 2011 an earthquake occurred near the northeastern coast of japan creating a tsunami that caused extensive damage our facilities in japan were not materially damaged however there were disruptions in our customers operations in japan as well as in the supply chain that supports their operations as a result we experienced a negative impact on our sales and operations in fiscal 2011 we estimate that sales and diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by 99 million and 007 per share respectively in fiscal 2011 there can be no assurance that the longterm consequence of the disaster will not adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

  our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical managerial marketing finance and administrative personnel 

our success depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain key employees at our operations around the world we depend on highly skilled technical personnel to design manufacture and support our wide range of electronic components additionally we rely upon experienced managerial marketing and support personnel to manage our business effectively and to successfully promote our wide range of products any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the necessary global management technical human resource and financial skills to achieve our objectives may have adverse affects on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we may use components and products manufactured by third parties 

we may rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we may rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition we also have thirdparty arrangements for the manufacture of certain products parts and components if these third parties fail to deliver quality products parts and components on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

  our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology 

the electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights within this industry companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will choose not to pursue litigation to protect our property rights depending on the importance of the technology product patent trademark or trade secret in question an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  a decline in the market value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

concerns about deterioration in the global economy together with concerns about credit inflation or deflation have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities including fixed income and equity which has and could further reduce the value of our pension plans investment portfolios in addition the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved a decrease in the value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding 

the global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit recent downgrades of credit ratings of sovereign debt including the us has similarly affected the availability and cost of capital as a result we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures the extent of any impact will depend on several factors 

including our operating cash flows the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions 

  divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

while we have completed the divestiture of underperforming or nonstrategic businesses and product lines that we began over four years ago we continue to evaluate specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered 

  recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill could negatively affect our results of operations 

we test goodwill allocated to reporting units for impairment annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances exist that indicate that a reporting units carrying value may exceed its fair value we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and determined that no impairment existed significant judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred in making this assessment we rely on a number of reporting unit specific factors including operating results business plans economic projections and anticipated future cash flows there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill should economic conditions further deteriorate or remain depressed estimates of future cash flows for our reporting units may be insufficient to support carrying value and the goodwill assigned to it requiring us to test for impairment impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position 

  if any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations our business may suffer 

our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the united states and the european union these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial including distribution agreements and practices with respect to the electrical components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we also may be subject to third party claims for damages further agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable if we are unable to enforce any of our commercial agreements whether at all or in material part our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected further any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are subject to global risks of political economic and military instability 

our workforce manufacturing research administrative and sales facilities markets customers and suppliers are located throughout the world and we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including 

• tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes • regulations related to customs and importexport matters • variations in lengths of payment cycles • tax issues such as tax law changes examinations by taxing authorities variations in tax laws from country to country and difficulties in repatriating in a taxefficient manner cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions • challenges in collecting accounts receivable • employment regulations and local labor conditions • difficulties protecting intellectual property • instability in economic or political conditions including sovereign debt levels inflation recession and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts and • the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements we have sizeable operations in china including 17 manufacturing sites in addition 15 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 were made to customers in china the legal system in china is still developing and is subject to change accordingly our operations and orders for products in china could be adversely affected by changes to or interpretation of chinese law 

in addition standard  poors recent credit rating downgrade of longterm us sovereign debt any future downgrade by other rating agencies of longterm us sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions which could negatively affect our business financial condition and liquidity 

  we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk antibribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk antibribery act and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance program we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate governing among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials • emissions or discharges of substances into the environment 18 

• investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites • greenhouse gas emissions and • the health and safety of our employees we may not have been or we may not at all times be in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators in addition environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain federal and state laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites 

while we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

  our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage hazardous material content and recycling 

the eu china and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal use of hazardous materials in products use of chemicals in manufacturing recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters these laws include the eu restriction of hazardous substances end of life vehicle and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the eu reach chemical registration directive the china law on management methods for controlling pollution by electronic information products and various other laws these laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes registration chemical testing labeling and other matters these laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale these laws could make manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions 

  we are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business we are a defendant in litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights anticompetitive behavior product liability breach of contract and employmentrelated claims in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust 

laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our bank credit facility contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt as defined in the credit facility to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as defined in the credit facility and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens our outstanding notes indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate merge and sell assets 

although none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations our continued ability to meet the bank credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant a breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our bank credit facility if the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder 

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

risks relating to our separation from tyco international 

  we share responsibility for certain of our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date 

in connection with our separation from tyco international in 2007 we tyco international and its former healthcare businesses covidien entered into a tax sharing agreement pursuant to which we share responsibility for certain of our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 more specifically we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of us income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our tyco internationals and covidiens us income tax returns certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation all costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties we are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in addition tyco international and covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula 

all the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from tyco international became our tax liabilities although we agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with tyco international and covidien pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities if tyco international and covidien default on their obligations to us under the tax sharing agreement we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities 

if any party to the tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our tyco internationals and covidiens tax liabilities 

our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities in connection with such examinations tax authorities including the us internal revenue service irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments we are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that we have assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of accounting standards codification asc 740 income taxes  have been reflected as liabilities on the consolidated financial statements the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest 

under the tax sharing agreement tyco international has the right to administer control and settle all us income tax audits for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 the timing nature and amount of any settlement agreed to by tyco international may not be in our best interests moreover the other parties to the tax sharing agreement will be able to remove tyco international as the controlling party only under limited circumstances including a change of control or bankruptcy of tyco international or by a majority vote of the parties on or after the second anniversary of the distribution all other tax audits will be administered controlled and settled by the party that would be responsible for paying the tax 

in september 2011 tyco international announced its intention to spinoff two of its businesses to its shareholders with tyco international remaining as a publiclytraded company although these transactions are in preliminary stages we expect that tyco international will continue to meet its legal obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

  if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

tyco international received private letter rulings from the irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution of our common shares and covidien common shares to the tyco international shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of our common shares and the covidien common shares will qualify as 

taxfree under sections 368a1d and 355 of the internal revenue code the code the private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the private letter rulings tyco international obtained opinions from outside legal counsel confirming the taxfree status of the distribution and certain internal transactions the private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us tyco international and covidien regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable tyco international would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common shares and covidien common shares distributed to tyco international shareholders on the distribution date over tyco internationals tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however we would incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation should be treated as taxable transactions 

in addition under the terms of the tax sharing agreement in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the distribution by us tyco international or covidien the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us tyco international or covidien as a result thereof if such determination is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us tyco international or covidien then we tyco international or covidien would be responsible for 31 27 and 42 respectively of any taxes imposed on us tyco international or covidien as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant in the event that any party to the tax sharing agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting partys obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other partys taxes 

risks relating to our swiss jurisdiction of incorporation 

  legislative and other proposals in switzerland the united states and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

various us and nonus legislative proposals and other initiatives have been directed at companies incorporated in lowertax jurisdictions we believe that recently there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and other initiatives as various jurisdictions look for solutions to fiscal deficits if adopted these proposed changes could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives and we cannot assure you that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us 

  legislation in the united states could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to us companies that have moved to lowertax jurisdictions 

we expect the us congress to continue to consider implementation andor expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate 

locations abroad we believe that we are less likely to be subject to such proposals since becoming a swiss corporation in june 2009 however we cannot predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals therefore we cannot assure you that any such legislative action will not apply to us in addition we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to us federal or state governments or the willingness of our nongovernmental customers to do business with us as a result of these uncertainties we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot assure you that the impact will not be materially adverse to us 

  as a swiss corporation we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares 

as a swiss corporation our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements our articles of association allow us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors but this authorization is limited to i authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years which authorization period ends on march 9 2013 and ii conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation dividends andor voting moreover under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convene a meeting of shareholders which would delay the timing to execute such actions such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management while we do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us we cannot assure you that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors 

  swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

we are organized under the laws of switzerland it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states and switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of united states jurisdictions including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws would not be allowed in swiss courts as they are contrary to that nations public policy 

swiss corporate law which applies to us differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers thus holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

risks relating to our shares 

  the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors including 

• our quarterly or annual earnings • changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results • volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global economic conditions and investors concerns about potential risks to future economic growth • changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates • changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles • announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions and • the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business   we might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

in order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of swiss withholding tax we anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax purposes or registered share capital interpretations of recently enacted swiss tax legislation and various proposals in switzerland for tax law and corporate law changes if passed in the future may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax we are in discussions with swiss tax authorities regarding certain administrative aspects of recently enacted swiss tax legislation related to the classification of swiss contributed surplus in our swiss statutory financial statements for tax and statutory reporting purposes should we not be successful in our discussions we may need to formally enter into an appeal process in order to gain a favorable ruling should we not gain favorable resolution we may be required to make certain statutory reclassifications to swiss contributed surplus in our swiss statutory financial statements that likely will limit our ability to make distributions on our shares free of swiss withholding tax in future years there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax purposes or through a reduction of registered share capital or that swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to do so could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

under swiss corporate law we are required to state our year end unconsolidated swiss statutory financial statements in swiss francs although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in us dollars shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions are required to be stated in swiss francs if the us dollar were to increase in value relative to the swiss franc the us dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without swiss withholding tax will decrease 

  we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares 

the swiss code of obligations regulates a corporations ability to hold or repurchase its own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation additionally interpretations of recently enacted swiss tax legislation and various proposals in switzerland for tax law and corporate law changes if passed in the future may affect our ability to repurchase our shares we are in discussions with swiss tax authorities regarding certain administrative aspects of recently enacted swiss tax legislation related to the classification of swiss contributed surplus in our swiss statutory financial statements for tax and statutory reporting purposes should we not be successful in our discussions we may need to formally enter into an appeal process in order to gain a favorable ruling should we not gain favorable resolution we may be required to make certain statutory reclassifications to swiss contributed surplus in our swiss statutory financial statements that may negatively impact our ability to repurchase our shares our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings 

our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by swiss law for swiss companies like us that issue registered shares as opposed to bearer shares this provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights holders of our shares must be registered in our share register aktienbuch as shareholders with voting rights only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders meetings but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends distributions preemptive rights advance subscription rights and liquidation proceeds the board of directors may in its discretion refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association additionally various proposals in switzerland for corporate law changes if passed in the future may require shareholder registration in order to exercise voting rights for shareholders who hold their shares in street name through brokerages and banks such a registration requirement could make our stock less attractive to investors 

  certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable 

our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered antitakeover provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors under these provisions among others 

• shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent and • restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15 or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors both of which provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorably by our shareholders our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital in either case representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in the case of issuances from authorized capital until march 9 2013 unless reauthorized by shareholders for a subsequent twoyear period without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders preemptive rights or advance subscription rights for the purpose of the defense of an actual threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid in relation to which the board of directors upon consultation with an independent financial advisor has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders we note that swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital in addition the new york stock exchange on which our shares are listed requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power with limited exceptions

 item 3 legal proceedings 

te connectivity legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including antitrust claims product liability matters environmental matters employment disputes tax matters disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes in addition we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims at any given time in the ordinary course of business we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions if infringement of a third partys patent were to be determined against us we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our 

ability to manufacture or sell one or more products if a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge which could be significant in amount 

management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows however one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in a future period 

legal matters under separation and distribution agreement 

the separation and distribution agreement among us tyco international and covidien provided for the allocation among the parties of tyco internationals assets liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to our and covidiens separations from tyco international on june 29 2007 under the separation and distribution agreement we assumed the liability for and control of all pending and threatened legal matters at separation related to our business or assumed or retained liabilities we were responsible for 31 of certain liabilities that arose from litigation pending or threatened at separation that was not allocated to one of the three parties and tyco international and covidien were responsible for 27 and 42 respectively of such liabilities if any party defaults in payment of its allocated share of any such liability each nondefaulting party will be responsible for an equal portion of the amount in default together with any other nondefaulting party although any such payments will not release the obligation of the defaulting party subject to the terms and conditions of the separation and distribution agreement tyco international manages and controls all the legal matters related to the shared contingent liabilities including the defense or settlement thereof subject to certain limitations all costs and expenses that tyco international incurs in connection with the defense of such litigation other than the amount of any judgment or settlement which is allocated in the manner described above will be borne equally by tyco international covidien and us at the present time all significant matters for which we shared responsibility with tyco international and covidien under the separation and distribution agreement which as previously reported in our periodic filings generally related to securities class action cases and other securities cases have been settled other than matters described below under compliance matters we presently are not aware of any additional legal matters which may arise for which we would bear a portion of the responsibility under the separation and distribution agreement 

compliance matters 

as previously reported in our periodic filings tyco international received and has responded to various allegations that certain improper payments were made by tyco international subsidiaries including our subsidiaries in recent years prior to the separation tyco international reported to the us department of justice and the sec the investigative steps and remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations including that it retained outside counsel to perform a companywide baseline review of its policies controls and practices with respect to compliance with the fcpa and that it would continue to investigate and make periodic progress reports to these agencies to date our baseline review has revealed that some of our former business practices may not have complied with fcpa requirements at this time we believe we have adequate amounts recorded related to these matters the amounts of which are not significant any judgment settlement or other cost incurred by tyco international in connection with these matters not specifically allocated to tyco international covidien or us would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the separation and distribution agreement 

matters related to our former wireless systems business 

state of new york contract 

in september 2005 we were awarded a twentyyear lease contract with the state of new york the state to construct operate and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders in august 2008 we were served by the state with a default notice related to the first regional network pursuant to the contract under the terms of the contract we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the state in october 2008 we informed the state that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified the system ready for testing the state conducted further testing during november and december 2008 in january 2009 the state notified us that in the states opinion we had not fully remediated the issues cited by the state and it had determined that we were in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract the state contends that it has the right under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the state in conjunction with the implementation of the network and as a result of this contention in january 2009 the state drew down 50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us the state has the ability to draw up to an additional 50 million against the standby letter of credit although we dispute that the state has any basis to do so 

in february 2009 we filed a claim in the new york court of claims seeking over 100 million in damages and alleging a number of causes of action including breach of contract unjust enrichment defamation conversion breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing the imposition of a constructive trust and seeking a declaration that the state terminated the contract for convenience in september 2009 the court granted the states motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint with the exception of the breach of contract claim and a claim for breach of warranty in connection with the states drawdown on the 50 million letter of credit in november 2009 the state filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim asserting breach of contract and alleging that the state has incurred damages in excess of 275 million we moved to dismiss the counterclaim in february 2010 and in june 2010 the court denied our motion we filed our answer to the states counterclaim in july 2010 we believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend to vigorously pursue our claims in this matter we filed a motion for summary judgment on the states counterclaim and the state filed a motion for summary judgment on our remaining claims which motions are under consideration oral argument on both parties motions for summary judgment has been set for november 29 2011 a trial date has been set for february 2012 

comnet 

at september 30 2011 we had a contingent purchase price commitment of 80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of comnet this represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of comnet only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the state of florida is finished and the state of florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers however the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in june 2006 in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania which is in the discovery phase a liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the consolidated financial statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or reasonably estimable at this time

the separation 

tyco electronics ltd was incorporated in bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a whollyowned subsidiary of then bermudabased tyco international effective june 29 2007 we became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of tyco international on june 29 2007 tyco international distributed all of our shares as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses to its common shareholders 

change of domicile 

effective june 25 2009 we discontinued our existence as a bermuda company as provided in the bermuda companies act and in accordance with article 161 of the swiss federal code on international private law continued our existence as a swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq of the swiss code of obligations the change of domicile the rights of holders of our shares are governed by swiss law our swiss articles of association and our swiss organizational regulations 

company name change 

in march 2011 our shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of association to change our name from tyco electronics ltd to te connectivity ltd the name change was effective march 10 2011 our ticker symbol tel on the new york stock exchange remained unchanged 

overview 

we are a global company that designs and manufactures approximately 500000 products that connect and protect the flow of power and data inside millions of products used by consumers and industries we partner with customers in a broad array of industries from consumer electronics energy and healthcare to automotive aerospace and communication networks 

we operate through three reporting segments transportation solutions communications and industrial solutions and network solutions see notes 1 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our segments 

we service our customers primarily through our direct sales force that serves customers in over 150 countries the sales force is supported by approximately 7500 engineers as well as globally deployed manufacturing sites through our sales force and engineering resources we are able to collaborate with our customers throughout the world to provide highly engineered products and solutions to meet their needs 

our strategic objective is to increase our net sales and profitability across our segments in the markets we serve this strategy is dependent upon the following strategic priorities 

• deliver extraordinary customer service • strengthen our innovation leadership • extend our leadership in emerging markets • lead in smart connectivity and • supplement organic growth with strategic partnerships and acquisitions outlook 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions our sales are dependent on certain industry end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending and our operating results can be affected by changes in demand in those markets overall our net sales increased 186 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2010 our net sales increased 177 as compared to fiscal 2009 our sales into consumer based markets particularly in the automotive end market in the transportation solutions segment have improved relative to fiscal 2010 also in industrial and infrastructure based markets our sales in the telecom networks energy enterprise networks aerospace defense and marine industrial touch solutions and data communications end markets have improved over prior year levels due to increased capital spending by industry and governments these improvements were partially offset by declines in the subsea communications and consumer devices end markets fiscal 2011 included an 

additional week which contributed 277 million in net sales and 008 per share to diluted earnings per share adc which was acquired on december 8 2010 contributed net sales of 964 million of which 26 million related to the additional week during fiscal 2011 

the earthquake and subsequent tsunami and aftershocks in japan in march 2011 caused disruptions in our customers operations and the supply chains that support their operations we estimate that net sales and diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by 99 million and 007 per share respectively in fiscal 2011 our facilities in japan were not materially damaged we do not expect any further impact in fiscal 2012 

net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 are expected to be between 34 and 35 billion reflecting growth in the transportation solutions segment particularly in the automotive end market and increased sales in the network solutions segment due to the acquisition of adc these increases are expected to be partially offset by weakness in the communications and industrial solutions segment as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011 in the first fiscal quarter of 2012 we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 066 to 070 per share for fiscal 2012 we expect net sales to be between 143 and 149 billion and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 300 to 330 per share this outlook assumes current foreign exchange and commodity rates 

we are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and on the end markets we serve additionally we continue to closely manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions we are also managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources 

acquisitions 

in july 2010 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement to acquire 100 of the outstanding stock of adc a provider of broadband communications network connectivity products and related solutions pursuant to the merger agreement we commenced a tender offer through a subsidiary to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of adc common stock at a purchase price of 1275 per share in cash followed by a merger of the subsidiary with and into adc with adc surviving as an indirect whollyowned subsidiary on december 8 2010 we acquired 868 of the outstanding common shares of adc on december 9 2010 we exercised our option under the merger agreement to purchase additional shares from adc that when combined with the shares purchased in the tender offer were sufficient to give us ownership of more than 90 of the outstanding adc common shares on december 9 2010 upon effecting a shortform merger under minnesota law we owned 100 of the outstanding shares of adc for a total purchase price of approximately 1263 million in cash excluding cash acquired of 546 million and 22 million representing the fair value of adc sharebased awards exchanged for te connectivity share options and stock appreciation rights 

the acquisition was made to accelerate our growth potential in the global broadband connectivity market the combined organization offers a complete product portfolio across every major geographic market it also added adcs distributed antenna system products which expanded our wireless connectivity portfolio to provide greater mobile coverage and capacity solutions to carrier and enterprise customers as demand for mobile data continues to expand we have realized and expect additional cost savings and other synergies through operational efficiencies including the consolidation of manufacturing marketing and general and administrative functions adcs businesses are reported as part of the network solutions segment from the date of acquisition 

during the period from december 9 2010 to september 30 2011 adc contributed net sales of 964 million and an operating loss of 59 million to our consolidated statements of operations the operating loss included restructuring charges of 82 million charges of 41 million associated with the

income taxes 

our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world we have provided for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation

our effective income tax rate was 316 for fiscal 2010 and reflects charges of 307 million primarily associated with certain proposed adjustments to prior year income tax returns and related accrued interest partially offset by income tax benefits of 101 million recognized in connection with the completion of certain nonus audits of prior year income tax returns in addition the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 reflects an income tax benefit of 72 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss carryforwards in certain nonus locations 

our effective income tax rate was 154 for fiscal 2009 and includes the effects of the 3547 million pretax impairment of goodwill for which a partial tax benefit of 523 million was recorded a 144 million pretax charge related to preseparation securities litigation for which a partial tax benefit of 25 million was recorded a 28 million charge related to the settlement of a tax matter and a 24 million detriment related to a 68 million pretax expense recognized pursuant to our tax sharing agreement with tyco international and covidien additionally the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects adjustments related to prior years tax returns including a 49 million tax benefit 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 1930 million and 2236 million at fiscal year end 2011 and 2010 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss capital loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of asc 740 which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest further management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate 

of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement income tax benefits may be recognized 

we have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries earnings that are expected to be distributed in fiscal 2012 no additional provision has been made for us or nonus income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested the investments are essentially permanent in duration or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings as of september 30 2011 certain subsidiaries had approximately 17 billion of undistributed earnings that we intend to permanently reinvest a liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed it is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries

communications and industrial solutions had operating income of 682 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to an operating loss of 1428 million in fiscal 2009 segment results included net restructuring and other charges of 20 million and 138 million during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively in fiscal 2009 segment results were negatively impacted by goodwill impairment charges of 1459 million and a net foreign currency loss of approximately 33 million associated primarily with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern european currencies excluding these items the increase in operating income was due primarily to an increase in gross margin primarily as a result of the increase in sales and to a lesser degree favorable product mix and cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in fiscal 2009 as well as improved manufacturing productivity

the following table sets forth network solutions percentage of total net sales by primary industry end market 1  



1 industry end market information about net sales is presented consistently with our internal management reporting and may be periodically revised as management deems necessary 

the following table provides an analysis of the change in network solutions net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by primary industry end market 



1 represents the change in net sales resulting from volume and price changes before consideration of acquisitions divestitures and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and for fiscal 2011 the impact of the 53 rd week 2 represents the change in net sales resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 3 represents the impact of an additional week in fiscal 2011 includes 26 million related to adc 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

in fiscal 2011 network solutions net sales increased 1161 million or 474 to 3612 million from 2451 million in fiscal 2010 organic net sales increased 78 million or 33 in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 the strengthening of certain foreign currencies positively impacted net sales by 83 million or 33 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately 74 million in net sales the acquisition of adc increased sales by 964 million of which 26 million is related to the additional week during fiscal 2011 the divestiture of the dulmison connectors and fittings product line in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by 12 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 

in the telecom networks end market our organic net sales increase of 226 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was largely due to increased fiber network investment by telecommunications companies particularly in the emea and south america regions in the energy end market our organic net sales increased 114 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due primarily to a continuing strong recovery across all regions in the enterprise networks end market our organic net sales increased 97 in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 levels as a result of increased data center investment in the emea region particularly in india and the asiapacific region the subsea communications end markets organic net sales decreased 214 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 as a result of lower levels of project activity we expect net sales in fiscal 2012 in the subsea communications end market to be similar to fiscal 2011 levels 

network solutions operating income increased 17 million to 329 million in fiscal 2011 from 312 million in fiscal 2010 during fiscal 2011 segment results included 142 million of charges related to the acquisition of adc including 82 million of restructuring charges 41 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition accountingrelated fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog and 19 million of acquisition and integration costs segment results also included additional net restructuring and other charges of 5 million in fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2010 segment results included 20 million of net restructuring and other charges and 8 million of acquisition and integration costs excluding these items operating income increased as a result of the acquisition of adc and volume increases partially offset by unfavorable product mix price erosion and increased material costs 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

in fiscal 2010 network solutions net sales decreased 429 million or 149 to 2451 million from 2880 million in fiscal 2009 organic net sales decreased 416 million or 145 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the strengthening of certain foreign currencies favorably affected net sales by 26 million or 10 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the divestiture of the dulmison connectors and fittings product line negatively impacted net sales by 39 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

in the telecom networks end market our organic net sales decrease of 23 in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 levels was primarily attributable to reduced wireline capital spending by telecommunications companies in the energy end market our organic net sales decrease of 19 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due to lower investment levels by utilities and reduced customer inventory levels in the enterprise networks end market organic sales increased 77 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of strong economic recoveries in asia and europe while the americas remained relatively flat in the subsea communications end market our organic net sales decreased 376 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to the completion of certain large projects during fiscal 2009 and lower levels of project activity in fiscal 2010 

in fiscal 2010 network solutions operating income decreased 40 million to 312 million from 352 million in fiscal 2009 segment results included 20 million of net restructuring and other charges and 8 million of acquisition and integration costs in fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2009 segment results included 64 million of net restructuring and other charges excluding these items the operating income decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales due to lower levels of project activity in the subsea communications end market and to a lesser degree price erosion partially offset by cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions implemented in fiscal 2009 and improved manufacturing productivity 

liquidity and capital resources 

our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets money markets or other sources of funding as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements we believe that cash generated from operations and to the extent necessary these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future we may use excess cash to reduce our outstanding debt including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program to pay distributions or dividends on our common shares or to acquire strategic businesses or product lines the cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions we will continue to monitor financial markets to respond as necessary to changing conditions 

cash flows from operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 1779 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to 1679 million in fiscal 2010 the increase of 100 million in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from higher income levels partially offset by a reduction of accrued and other current liabilities related to employee compensationrelated payments higher income taxes paid and payments for preseparation tax matters 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities was 1679 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to 1378 million in fiscal 2009 the increase of 301 million in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 primarily resulted from higher income levels partially offset by increased working capital to support current business levels 

pension and postretirement benefit contributions in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 were 90 million 180 million and 145 million respectively these amounts included voluntary pension contributions of 69 million and 61 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively there were no voluntary contributions in fiscal 2011 we expect pension and postretirement benefit contributions to be 102 million in fiscal 2012 before consideration of voluntary contributions 

the amount of income taxes paid net of refunds during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 was 299 million 156 million and 121 million respectively 

in fiscal 2011 cash payments related to preseparation tax matters were 129 million net of indemnification payments under the tax sharing agreement we expect to make additional net cash payments of approximately 90 million over the next twelve months related to these matters these amounts include payments in which we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities and for which we expect a portion to be reimbursed by tyco international and covidien under the tax sharing agreement as well as indemnification payments to tyco international and covidien under the tax sharing agreement for tax matters where they are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to preseparation tax matters 

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities we use free cash flow as a useful measure of our cash generation which is free from any significant existing obligation free cash flow was 1392 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to 1404 million in fiscal 2010 and 1226 million in fiscal 2009 the decline in free cash flow in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily driven by increases in capital expenditures partially offset by increases in cash provided by operating activities the increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was due primarily to increases in cash provided by operating activities the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities the most comparable gaap financial measure to free cash flow a nongaap financial measure 



cash flows from investing activities 

we continue to fund capital expenditures to support new programs and to invest in machinery and our manufacturing facilities to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities capital spending increased 196 million in fiscal 2011 to 581 million as compared to 385 million in fiscal 2010 capital spending was 328 million in fiscal 2009 we expect fiscal 2012 capital spending levels to be approximately 4 to 5 of net sales 

during fiscal 2011 we acquired adc for a total purchase price of approximately 1263 million in cash excluding cash acquired of 546 million and 22 million of other noncash consideration shortterm investments acquired in connection with the acquisition of adc were sold for proceeds of 155 million in fiscal 2011 certain other assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of adc were sold for net proceeds of 111 million of which approximately 106 million was received in fiscal 2011 we also acquired another business for 14 million in cash in fiscal 2011

in october 2009 our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of chf 034 equivalent to 032 per share payable in two equal installments in each of the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010 we paid the first and second installments of the distribution at a rate of 016 per share each during the quarters ended december 25 2009 and march 26 2010 these capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from chf 243 equivalent to 224 to chf 209 equivalent to 192

contributed surplus established during the change of domicile for swiss tax and statutory purposes swiss contributed surplus subject to certain conditions is a freely distributable reserve upon our implementation of recently enacted swiss tax law regarding the classification of swiss contributed surplus for swiss tax and statutory purposes distributions to shareholders from swiss contributed surplus will be free from withholding tax we are in discussions with swiss tax authorities regarding certain administrative aspects of the law related to the classification of swiss contributed surplus for tax and statutory reporting purposes should we not be successful in our discussions we may need to formally enter into an appeal process in order to gain a favorable ruling should we not gain favorable resolution we may be required to make certain statutory reclassifications to swiss contributed surplus that likely will limit our ability to make distributions free of withholding tax in future years and may negatively impact our ability to repurchase our shares in future years see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

income tax matters 

in connection with the separation we entered into a tax sharing agreement that generally governs our covidiens and tyco internationals respective rights responsibilities and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes if any incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of our shares or the shares of covidien to qualify as a taxfree distribution for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoffs to qualify for taxfavored treatment under the code 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and tax sharing agreement upon separation we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and covidien under these agreements principally the tax sharing agreement we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters of tyco international the effect of the tax sharing agreement is to indemnify us for 69 of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved preseparation tax matters pursuant to that indemnification we have made similar indemnifications to tyco international and covidien with respect to 31 of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties 

obligation we are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in addition tyco international and covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula 

in september 2011 tyco international announced its intention to spinoff two of its businesses to its shareholders with tyco international remaining as a publiclytraded company although these transactions are in preliminary stages we expect that tyco international will continue to meet its legal obligations under the tax sharing agreement 

prior to separation certain of our subsidiaries filed combined tax returns with tyco international those and other of our subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments tyco international as the us income tax audit controlling party under the tax sharing agreement is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 which relate specifically to our entities have been recorded on the consolidated financial statements in addition we may be required to fund portions of covidien and tyco internationals tax obligations estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the consolidated financial statements see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in prior years in connection with the irs audit of various fiscal years tyco international submitted to the irs proposed adjustments to prior period us federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed the irs accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments for fiscal 1997 through 2000 for which the irs had completed its field work on the basis of previously accepted amendments we have determined that acceptance of adjustments presented for additional periods through fiscal 2006 is more likely than not to be accepted and accordingly have recorded them as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the irs on the consolidated financial statements 

in fiscal 2009 certain proposed adjustments to us federal income tax returns were completed by tyco international and in connection with these adjustments we recorded a 97 million increase in income tax liabilities a 10 million increase in deferred tax assets a 60 million increase in the receivable from tyco international and covidien in connection with the tax sharing agreement and a 27 million charge to contributed surplus see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the indemnification liability to tyco international and covidien 

as our tax return positions continue to be updated for periods prior to separation additional adjustments may be identified and recorded on the consolidated financial statements while the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed and accepted by the irs we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows additionally adjustments may be recorded to equity in the future for the impact of filing final or amended income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of tyco international covidien andor our subsidiaries for the periods prior to the separation 

during fiscal 2007 the irs concluded its field examination of certain of tyco internationals us federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued revenue agent reports which reflect the irs determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period tyco international has appealed certain proposed adjustments totaling approximately 1 billion additionally the irs proposed civil fraud penalties against tyco international arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999 based upon statutory guidelines tyco international estimates the proposed penalties could range between 30 million and 50 million the penalty is asserted against a prior subsidiary of tyco international that 

was distributed to us in connection with the separation any penalty ultimately imposed upon our subsidiary would be subject to sharing with tyco international and covidien under the tax sharing agreement it is our understanding that tyco international continues to make progress towards resolving a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000 however several significant matters remain in dispute the remaining issues in dispute involve the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions tyco international has indicated that it is unlikely to achieve the resolution of these contested adjustments through the irs appeals process and therefore may be required to litigate the disputed issues for those issues not remaining in dispute it is likely that tyco international will settle with the irs and pay any related deficiencies within the next twelve months over the next twelve months we expect to pay approximately 90 million inclusive of related indemnification payments in connection with preseparation tax matters 

during fiscal 2011 the irs completed its field examination of certain tyco international income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 issued revenue agent reports which reflect the irs determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 2001 through 2004 period and issued certain notices of deficiency as a result of the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain tax matters in fiscal 2011 we recognized income tax benefits of 35 million and other expense of 14 million pursuant to the tax sharing agreement for a portion of these preseparation deficiencies we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for which we paid 132 million in fiscal 2011 concurrent with remitting these payments we were reimbursed 93 million from tyco international and covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for preseparation tax matters in addition we paid a total of 115 million in fiscal 2011 to tyco international and covidien for our share of 2001 through 2004 preseparation tax deficiencies for which tyco international and covidien are the primary obligors to the taxing authorities as a result our net cash payment attributable to these matters was 154 million in fiscal 2011 

the irs commenced its audit of certain tyco international income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011 

during fiscal 2009 tyco international settled a matter with the irs concerning certain tax deductions claimed on tyco internationals income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 as a result of this settlement we recorded a 28 million income tax charge in fiscal 2009 to reflect the disallowance of a portion of these deductions 

at september 30 2011 and september 24 2010 we have reflected 232 million and 244 million respectively of income tax liabilities related to the audits of tyco internationals and our income tax returns in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within one year 

we continue to believe that the amounts recorded on our consolidated financial statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate however the ultimate resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations financial position or cash flows

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including patent infringement claims product liability matters employment disputes tax matters disputes on agreements other commercial disputes environmental matters and antitrust claims management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows however one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in a future period 

see part i item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding legal proceedings 

matters related to our former wireless systems business 

certain liabilities and contingencies related to our former wireless systems business were retained by us when this business was sold in fiscal 2009 these include certain retained liabilities related to the state of new york contract and a contingent purchase price commitment related to the acquisition of comnet by the wireless systems business in 2001 see additional information below also see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the wireless systems business 

state of new york contract 

in september 2005 we were awarded a twentyyear lease contract with the state of new york the state to construct operate and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders in august 2008 we were served by the state with a default notice related to the first regional network pursuant to the contract under the terms of the contract we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the state in october 2008 we informed the state that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified the system ready for testing the state conducted further testing during november and december 2008 in january 2009 the state notified us that in the states opinion we had not fully remediated the issues cited by the state and it had determined that we were in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract the state contends that it has the right under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the state in conjunction with the implementation of the network and as a result of this contention in january 2009 the state drew down 50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us the state has the ability to draw up to an additional 50 million against the standby letter of credit although we dispute that the state has any basis to do so 

in february 2009 we filed a claim in the new york court of claims seeking over 100 million in damages and alleging a number of causes of action including breach of contract unjust enrichment defamation conversion breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing the imposition of a constructive trust and seeking a declaration that the state terminated the contract for convenience in september 2009 the court granted the states motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint with the exception of the breach of contract claim and a claim for breach of warranty in connection with the states drawdown on the 50 million letter of credit in november 2009 the state filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim asserting breach of contract and alleging that the state has incurred damages in excess of 275 million we moved to dismiss the counterclaim in february 2010 and in june 2010 the court denied our motion we filed our answer to the states counterclaim in july 2010 we believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend to vigorously pursue our claims in this matter a trial date has been set for february 2012 

as a result of these actions in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded pretax charges totaling 111 million associated with this contract these charges are reflected in loss from discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of operations as a result of our sale of the wireless systems business see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of discontinued operations and the sale of the wireless systems business the charges included an impairment charge of 61 million to writeoff all costs incurred in constructing the network as well as a charge equal to the amount drawn by the state against the standby letter of credit of 50 million 

comnet 

at september 30 2011 we had a contingent purchase price commitment of 80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of comnet this represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of comnet only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the state of florida is finished and the state of florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers however the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in june 2006 in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania which is in the discovery phase a liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the consolidated financial statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or reasonably estimable at this time 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

certain of our segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2012 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

at september 30 2011 we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of 436 million of which 50 million was related to our contract with the state of new york in january 2009 the state drew down 50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us as a result we recorded a pretax charge equal to the draw although we dispute that the state has any basis to do so the state has the ability to draw up to an additional 50 million against the standby letter of credit which could result in additional charges and could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these liabilities 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance in the opinion of management except for the potential claims related to the contract with the state of new york discussed above such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and tax sharing agreement upon separation we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and covidien under these agreements principally the tax sharing agreement we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters of tyco international the effect of the tax sharing agreement is to indemnify us for 69 of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved preseparation tax matters pursuant to that indemnification we have made similar indemnifications to tyco international and covidien with respect to 31 of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters if any of the companies 

responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation these arrangements have been valued upon our separation from tyco international in accordance with asc 460 and accordingly liabilities amounting to 249 million were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2011 see notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the following noted accounting policies are based on among other things judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

revenue recognition 

our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with asc 605 revenue recognition  and sec staff accounting bulletin topic 13 revenue recognition  

our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer this generally occurs when the products reach the freeonboard shipping point the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured for those items where title has not yet transferred we have deferred the recognition of revenue a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies a reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales 

contract revenues for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete percentageofcompletion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable in addition provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable contract revenues for construction related projects are generated primarily in the network solutions segment 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents trademarks and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 1 to 50 years that are amortized generally on a straightline basis an evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation we assess intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other longlived assets goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a 

triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred in assessing the existence of a triggering event management relies on a number of reporting unit specific factors including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

when testing for goodwill impairment we follow the guidance prescribed in asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  first we perform a step i goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment in doing so we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill may be impaired and a step ii goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss in the step ii goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 

estimates about fair value used in the step i goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit the income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction and guideline analyses these approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates discount rates income tax rates and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and determined that no impairment existed and that the fair value of all reporting units to which goodwill is allocated is well in excess of the respective carrying value 

income taxes 

in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and international pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in 

the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings any changes in a valuation allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition will be reflected in the income tax provision 

changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 income taxes  we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest further management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement income tax benefits may be recognized these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 

pension and postretirement benefits 

our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions the funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date for defined benefit pension plans the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on estimated future compensation levels for the postretirement benefit plans the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered the fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds held for the sole benefit of participants which are invested by the trust funds mandatory contribution amounts are actuarially determined voluntary contributions are at our discretion the benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors such as years of service and compensation 

net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants 

two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and employee turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations a 25 basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate would 

have increased or decreased respectively the present value of our pension obligations by 107 million at fiscal year end 2011 we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets would have increased or decreased respectively our fiscal 2011 pension expense by 10 million 

during fiscal 2008 our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the us plans master trust from 60 equity and 40 fixed income to 30 equity and 70 fixed income in an effort to better align asset risk with the anticipated payment of benefit obligations the target asset allocation transition began in fiscal 2008 asset reallocation will continue over a multiyear period based on the funded status of the us plans master trust and market conditions as of september 30 2011 our actual asset allocation is approximately 35 equity and 65 fixed income 

sharebased compensation 

we determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant using the blackscholesmerton valuation model the blackscholesmerton model requires certain assumptions that involve judgment such assumptions are the expected share price volatility expected annual dividend yield expected life of options and riskfree interest rate see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to sharebased compensation an increase in the volatility of our stock will increase the amount of sharebased compensation expense on new awards an increase in the holding period of options will also cause an increase in sharebased compensation expense dividend yields and riskfree interest rates are less difficult to estimate but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in sharebased compensation expense and an increase in the riskfree interest rate will increase sharebased compensation expense 

acquisitions 

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses requires among other things that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill we may engage independent thirdparty appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets 

critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer and distributor relationships acquired developed technologies and patents expected costs to develop inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from projects when completed brand awareness and market position as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio customer and distributor attrition rates and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in december 2010 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update to guidance in asc 805 business combinations  that clarifies the disclosure requirements for pro forma presentation of revenue and earnings related to a business combination we elected to early adopt this guidance during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued updates to guidance in asc 810 consolidation  that address accounting for variable interest entities we adopted these updates to asc 810 in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in september 2011 the fasb issued an update to guidance in asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  that introduces the use of qualitative factors when considering the need to perform a step i goodwill impairment test on one of our reporting units if we conclude that qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value we do not need to perform a step i goodwill impairment test on that reporting unit this update to asc 350 is effective for us in fiscal 2013 however we intend to early adopt the standard during fiscal 2012 adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued an update to guidance in asc 220 comprehensive income  that changes the presentation and disclosure requirements of comprehensive income in interim and annual financial statements these updates to asc 220 are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued an update to guidance in asc 820 fair value measurement  that clarifies the application of fair value and enhances disclosure regarding valuation of financial instruments and level 3 fair value measurement inputs these updates to asc 820 are effective for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

organic net sales growth 

organic net sales growth is a nongaap financial measure the difference between reported net sales growth the most comparable gaap measure and organic net sales growth the nongaap measure consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates acquisitions divestitures and an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business it excludes items that are not completely under managements control such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company such as acquisition and divestiture activity and the impact of an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length 

we believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business furthermore it provides investors with a view of our operations from managements perspective we use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations management uses organic net sales growth together with gaap measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments 

and our overall company we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations the discussion and analysis of organic net sales growth in results of operations above utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies organic net sales growth amounts presented above may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies organic net sales growth is a nongaap financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales this limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our gaap net sales the tables presented in results of operations above provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under gaap 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure the difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities the most comparable gaap measure and free cash flow the nongaap measure consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify free cash flow is a useful measure of our cash generation which is free from any significant existing obligation it also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans free cash flow permits management and investors to gain insight into the amount that management employs to measure cash that is free from any significant existing obligation 

free cash flow excludes net capital expenditures voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items net capital expenditures are subtracted because they represent longterm commitments voluntary pension contributions are subtracted from the gaap measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity certain special items including net payments related to preseparation tax matters and preseparation litigation payments are also considered by management in evaluating free cash flow we believe investors should also consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow 

free cash flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures reported by other companies the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our gaap cash flow also it subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within managements and the board of directors discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable gaap measure indicates this limitation is best addressed by using free cash flow in combination with the gaap cash flow results 

the tables presented in liquidity and capital resources above provide reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from continuing operating activities calculated under gaap

the following and other risks which are described in greater detail in part i item 1a risk factors as well as other risks described in this annual report could also cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements 

• conditions in the global or regional economies and global capital markets and cyclical industry conditions • conditions affecting demand for products in the industries we serve particularly the automotive industry and the telecommunications computer and consumer electronics industries • competition and pricing pressure • market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations and product life cycles • raw material availability quality and cost • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates • financial condition and consolidation of customers and vendors • reliance on thirdparty suppliers • our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel • risks that adcs operations will not be successfully integrated into ours and that we do not achieve expected synergies • risks associated with future acquisitions and divestitures • global risks of business interruptions such as natural disasters and political economic and military instability • risks related to compliance with current and future environmental and other laws and regulations • our ability to protect our intellectual property rights • risks of litigation • our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by our debt instruments • risks relating to our separation on june 29 2007 from tyco international ltd • the possible effects on us of various us and nonus legislative proposals and other initiatives that if adopted could materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate and negatively impact our us government contracts business • various risks associated with being a swiss corporation • the impact of fluctuations in the market price of our shares and • the impact of certain provisions of our articles of association on unsolicited takeover proposals there may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks 

we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an aa2 credit rating there is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty 

foreign currency exposures 

as part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we utilize foreign currency forward and swap contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany transactions accounts receivable accounts payable and other cash transactions a 10 appreciation of the us dollar from the september 30 2011 market rates would have decreased the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 19 million while a 10 depreciation of the us dollar would have increased the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 24 million a 10 appreciation of the us dollar from the september 24 2010 market rates would have decreased the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 12 million while a 10 depreciation of the us dollar would have increased the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 15 million such gains or losses on these contracts would be generally offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions 

interest rate and investment exposures 

we issue debt from time to time to fund our operations and capital needs such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure to manage the interest rate exposure and to minimize overall interest cost we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixedrate debt into variablerate debt we use forward starting interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate swaps swaptions to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixedrate debt we also utilize interest rate swap contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges to manage interest rate and earnings exposure on cash and cash equivalents and certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities 

during fiscal 2011 we entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on 150 million principal amount of the 4875 senior notes that mature in 2021 to manage interest rate exposure the maturity dates of the interest rate swaps coincide with the maturity date of the notes under these contracts we receive fixed amounts of interest applicable to the underlying notes and pay a floating amount based upon the three month us dollar london interbank offered rate 

during fiscal 2010 we purchased swaptions and entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure prior to the probable issuance of fixedrate debt when our 600 senior notes mature in 2012 the swaptions and forward starting interest rate swaps are based on a total notional amount of 400 million also during fiscal 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge on 50 million principal amount of the 600 senior notes 

based on our floating rate debt balance of 202 million at september 30 2011 an increase in the levels of the us dollar interest rates by 05 with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately 1 million based on our floating 

rate debt balance of 150 million at september 24 2010 an increase in the levels of the us dollar interest rates by 05 with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately 1 million 

commodity exposures 

our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows we utilize commodity swap contracts all of which are designated as cash flow hedges we continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next twelve to eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts in order to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period at september 30 2011 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold and silver were in a loss position of 1 million and had a notional value of 211 million at september 24 2010 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold and silver were in a gain position of 12 million and had a notional value of 108 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold and a troy ounce of silver from the september 30 2011 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 21 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold and a troy ounce of silver from the september 24 2010 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 12 million

1 the americas includes our subsea communications segment 

see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding geographic areas 

we collaborate closely with our customers so that their product needs are met there is no single customer that accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 2009 or 2008 our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further developing our product families and ensuring that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support we believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers 

raw materials 

we use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products the principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding precious metals such as gold and silver for plating and other metals such as copper aluminum brass and steel for manufacturing cable contacts and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers the prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand dynamics 

working capital 

we consistently maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs there are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development in an effort to introduce new products to enhance the effectiveness ease of use safety and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas where we may have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition 

our research and development expense for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 was as follows 



our research development and engineering efforts are supported by approximately 7000 engineers these engineers work closely with our customers to develop application specific highly engineered products and systems to satisfy the customers needs our new products including product extensions introduced during the previous three years comprised approximately 26 of our net sales for fiscal 2010 

sales marketing and distribution 

we sell our products into more than 150 countries and we sell primarily through direct selling efforts we also sell some of our products indirectly via thirdparty distributors in fiscal 2010 our direct sales represented 80 of net sales with the remainder of net sales provided by sales to thirdparty distributors and independent manufacturer representatives 

we maintain distribution centers around the world products are generally delivered to these distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer in some instances product is delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer we contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products via road rail sea and air 

seasonality and backlog 

customer orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business conditions and because unfilled orders may be canceled prior to shipment of goods we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business the third fiscal quarter is typically the strongest quarter of our fiscal year while the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by winter holidays and the fourth fiscal quarter is negatively affected by european holidays the second fiscal quarter may also be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in certain of our end markets 

backlog by reportable segment at fiscal year end 2010 and 2009 was as follows 



we expect that the majority of our backlog at september 24 2010 will be filled during fiscal 2011 

competition 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers competition is generally on the basis of breadth of product offering product innovation price quality delivery and service our markets have generally been growing but with downward pressure on prices 

• electronic components this segment competes against numerous companies including molex amphenol fci jst and omron • network solutions this segments major competitors include corning commscope 3m cooper industries thomas  betts and hubbell • specialty products this segment competes against numerous companies including molex amphenol deutsch radiall 3m smart technologies wintek corporation littelfuse polytronics bel fuse odu and lemo • subsea communications this segment primarily competes against alcatellucent intellectual property 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we also rely upon trade secrets manufacturing knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position we review thirdparty proprietary rights including patents and patent applications as available in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty proprietary rights identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others 

we own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical and electronic products we also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks 

while we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets we do not believe that our competitive position is dependent on patent or trademark protection or that our operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents 

employees 

as of september 24 2010 we employed approximately 89000 people worldwide of whom 23000 were in the americas region 25000 were in the europemiddle eastafrica region and 41000 were in 

the asiapacific region of our total employees approximately 55000 were employed in manufacturing and 22000 were represented by collective bargaining agreements approximately 64 of our employees were based in lowercost countries primarily china we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 

government regulation and supervision 

the import and export of products are subject to regulation by the united states and other countries a small portion of our products including defenserelated products may require governmental import and export licenses whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events we have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction 

environmental 

our operations are subject to numerous health safety and environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment we are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment we maintain a global environmental health and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards staff dedicated to environmental health and safety issues periodic compliance auditing training and other measures we have a program for compliance with the european union eu restriction of hazardous substances and waste electrical and electronics equipment directives the china restriction of hazardous substances law and similar laws 

compliance with these laws has in the past and may in the future increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways for example our costs may increase indirectly through increased energy and product costs as producers of energy cement iron steel pulp paper petroleum and other major emitters of greenhouse gases are subjected to increased or new regulation or legislation that results in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions we also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations based upon our experience current information and applicable laws we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the range of approximately 14 million to 24 million as of september 24 2010 we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately 14 million we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2011 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities the risks described below are not the only ones facing us our business is also subject to risks that affect many other companies such as general economic conditions geopolitical events competition technological obsolescence labor relations natural disasters and international operations additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations financial condition and liquidity 

risks relating to our business 

  conditions in global or regional economies capital and money markets and banking systems and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or worldwide including the cost and availability of consumer and business credit end demand from consumer and industrial markets and concerns as to sovereign debt levels any of which could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow and ability to obtain financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full further our vendors may experience similar problems which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels if regional or global economic conditions deteriorate our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products and our operating results can be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets our sales are dependent on certain end markets that are impacted by consumer industrial and infrastructure spending and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets for example the automotive industry which accounted for approximately 35 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 is still below fiscal 2008 levels as described below the telecommunications industry which accounted for approximately 16 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 has historically experienced periods of robust capital expenditure followed by periods of retrenchment and consolidation the aerospace defense and marine industry which accounted for 5 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 has undergone significant fluctuations in demand depending on worldwide economic and political conditions periodic downturns in our customers industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are dependent on the automotive industry which experienced significant declines in the recent economic environment 

approximately 35 of our net sales for fiscal 2010 were to customers in the automotive industry automotive manufacturers globally have experienced significantly lower levels of vehicle sales as a result of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn and credit conditions although sales have increased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 levels sales still remain below fiscal 2008 levels additionally the automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers as a supplier of automotive electronics products our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by changes in the operations products business models partsourcing requirements financial condition and market share of automotive manufacturers as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers 

  we are dependent on the telecommunications computer and consumer electronics industries 

approximately 16 of our net sales for fiscal 2010 came from sales to the telecommunications industry demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change and was and remains affected by declines in consumer and business spending additionally these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in the telecommunications industry and our inability to do so would materially impair our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

approximately 9 of our net sales for fiscal 2010 came from sales to the computer and consumer electronics industries demand for our computer and consumer electronics products depends on underlying business and consumer demand for computer and consumer electronics products as well as the market share of our customers demand was and remains affected by reduced spending we cannot assure you that existing levels of business and consumer demand for new computer and consumer electronics products will not decrease 

  we encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry 

we operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components the competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large diversified manufacturers to small highly specialized manufacturers the electronic components industry has continued to become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities a number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may enjoy lower production costs for certain products we cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors 

  we are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue 

substantially all of the markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences which are rapid in certain end markets our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design develop introduce and sell new and innovative products to modify existing products and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change there are numerous risks inherent in these processes including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands 

  like other suppliers to the electronics industry we are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices 

we have historically experienced and we expect to continue to experience continuing pressure to lower our prices in recent years we have experienced price erosion averaging from 1 to 2 in order to maintain our margins we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts we cannot assure you that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our results are sensitive to raw material availability quality and cost 

we are a large buyer of resin copper gold brass steel chemicals and additives zinc and other precious metals many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers in addition the price of many of 

these raw materials including gold and copper has increased in recent years and continues to fluctuate in recent years we have only been able to partially offset these increases through higher selling prices our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials the quality of available raw materials deteriorates or there are continued significant price increases for these raw materials any of these events could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials and to the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers our margins may decline materially affecting our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue approximately 57 of our net sales for fiscal 2010 were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect nonus dollar revenue to represent a significant and potentially increased portion of our future net revenue therefore when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro our us dollar reported revenue and income will decrease changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage this risk in part by entering into financial derivative contracts in addition to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to these contracts our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful 

  we may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate 

many of the industries to which we sell our products as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials have become more concentrated in recent years including the automotive telecommunications computer and aerospace defense and marine industries consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us in addition as our customers buy in larger volumes their volume buying power has increased and they have been able to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing these trends may adversely affect the profit margins on our products particularly for commodity components 

  the life cycles of our products can be very short 

the life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle as a result the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment if we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses our results of operations financial position and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected 

  the adc telecommunications inc acquisition and future acquisitions may not be successful 

in july 2010 we announced our entry into an agreement to acquire adc telecommunications inc adc and we regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses product lines or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings risks associated with the acquisition of adc include the risk that the transaction may not be consummated the risk that regulatory approval that may be required for the transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated risks associated with our ability to issue debt to fund a portion of the purchase price the risk that adc will not be integrated successfully into tyco electronics and the risk that revenue opportunities cost savings and other anticipated synergies from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than 

expected we also cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with other acquisition candidates in the future nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity 

if we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements this acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures we cannot assure you that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required if we were to undertake an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares 

  our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical managerial marketing finance and administrative personnel 

our success depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain key employees at our operations around the world we depend on highly skilled technical personnel to design manufacture and support our wide range of electronic components additionally we rely upon experienced managerial marketing and support personnel to manage our business effectively and to successfully promote our wide range of products any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the necessary global management technical human resource and financial skills to achieve our objectives may have adverse affects on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we may use components and products manufactured by third parties 

we may rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we may rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition we also have thirdparty arrangements for the manufacture of certain products parts and components if these third parties fail to deliver quality products parts and components on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

  our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology 

the electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights within this industry companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will choose not to pursue litigation to protect our property rights depending on the importance of the technology product patent trademark or trade secret in question an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  a decline in the market value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

concerns about deterioration in the global economy together with concerns about credit inflation or deflation have caused significant volatility in the price of all securities including fixed income and equity which has and could further reduce the value of our pension plans investment portfolios in addition the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved a decrease in the value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding 

the global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit if these conditions continue or worsen we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures the extent of any impact will depend on several factors including our operating cash flows the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets our credit ratings and credit capacity the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions 

  divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

while we have substantially completed the streamlining of our portfolio that we began over three years ago we may in the future evaluate the performance of specific businesses and products and may continue to sell businesses or product lines any divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position divestitures could involve additional risks including difficulties in the separation of operations services products and personnel the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered 

  recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill could negatively affect our results of operations 

we test goodwill allocated to reporting units for impairment annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances exist that indicate that a reporting units carrying value may exceed its fair value we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and determined that no impairment existed significant judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred in making this assessment we rely on a number of factors including among others operating results business plans economic projections and anticipated future cash flows there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill should economic conditions further deteriorate or remain depressed estimates of future cash flows for our reporting units may be insufficient to support carrying value and the goodwill assigned to it requiring us to test for impairment impairment charges if any may be material to our results of operations and financial position 

  if any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations our business may suffer 

our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business in particular the united states and the european union these laws prohibit among other things anticompetitive agreements and practices if any of our commercial including distribution agreements and practices with respect to the electrical components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws we may be subject to civil and other penalties we also may be subject to third party claims for damages further agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable in whole or in part or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable if we are unable to enforce any of our commercial agreements whether at all or in material part our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected further any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  we are subject to global risks of political economic and military instability 

our workforce manufacturing administrative and sales facilities markets customers and suppliers are located throughout the world and we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including 

• tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes • regulations related to customs and importexport matters • variations in lengths of payment cycles • tax issues such as tax law changes examinations by taxing authorities variations in tax laws from country to country and difficulties in repatriating in a taxefficient manner cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions • challenges in collecting accounts receivable • employment regulations and local labor conditions • difficulties protecting intellectual property • instability in economic or political conditions including inflation recession and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts and • the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements we have sizeable operations in china including manufacturing operations and in fiscal 2010 16 of our net sales were made to customers in china the legal system in china is still developing and is subject to change accordingly our operations and orders for products in china could be adversely affected by changes to or interpretation of chinese law 

  we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance program we cannot 

assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate governing among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials • emissions or discharges of substances into the environment • investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites • greenhouse gas emissions and • the health and safety of our employees we may not have been or we may not at all times be in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators in addition environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain federal and state laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from the us environmental protection agency and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites 

while we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

  our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage hazardous material content and recycling 

the eu china and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal use of hazardous materials in products use of chemicals in manufacturing recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters these laws include the eu restriction of hazardous substances end of life vehicle and waste electrical and electronic equipment directives the eu reach chemical registration directive the china law on management methods for controlling pollution by electronic information products and various other laws these laws prohibit the use of 

certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes registration chemical testing labeling and other matters these laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale these laws could make manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible and could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions 

  we are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business we are a defendant in litigation including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights anticompetitive behavior product liability breach of contract and employmentrelated claims in certain circumstances patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our bank credit facility contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt as defined in the credit facility to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as defined in the credit facility and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens our outstanding notes indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate merge and sell assets 

although none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations our continued ability to meet the bank credit facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant a breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or indentures upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our credit facility and indentures the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our bank credit facility if the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our other affected indebtedness acceleration of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder 

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date upon a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event which could result in a default under the notes any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event 

risks relating to our separation from tyco international 

  we share responsibility for certain of our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the distribution date 

in connection with our separation from tyco international in 2007 we tyco international and its former healthcare businesses covidien entered into a tax sharing agreement pursuant to which we share responsibility for certain of our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 more specifically we tyco international and covidien share 31 27 and 42 respectively of us income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our tyco internationals and covidiens us income tax returns certain income tax liabilities arising from adjustments made by tax authorities to intercompany transactions or similar adjustments and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation all costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties we are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in addition tyco international and covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula 

all the tax liabilities that are associated with our businesses including liabilities that arose prior to our separation from tyco international became our tax liabilities although we agreed to share certain of these tax liabilities with tyco international and covidien pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we remain primarily liable for all of these liabilities if tyco international and covidien default on their obligations to us under the tax sharing agreement we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities 

if any party to the tax sharing agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other nondefaulting party the amounts in default in addition if another party to the tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our tyco internationals and covidiens tax liabilities 

our tyco internationals and covidiens income tax returns are examined periodically by various tax authorities in connection with such examinations tax authorities including the us internal revenue service irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments we are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that we have assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of accounting standards codification asc 740 income taxes  have been reflected as liabilities on the consolidated financial statements the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest 

under the tax sharing agreement tyco international has the right to administer control and settle all us income tax audits for periods prior to and including june 29 2007 the timing nature and amount of any settlement agreed to by tyco international may not be in our best interests moreover the other parties to the tax sharing agreement will be able to remove tyco international as 

the controlling party only under limited circumstances including a change of control or bankruptcy of tyco international or by a majority vote of the parties on or after the second anniversary of the distribution all other tax audits will be administered controlled and settled by the party that would be responsible for paying the tax 

  if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

tyco international received private letter rulings from the irs regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution of our common shares and covidien common shares to the tyco international shareholders substantially to the effect that the distribution except for cash received in lieu of a fractional share of our common shares and the covidien common shares will qualify as taxfree under sections 368a1d and 355 of the internal revenue code the code the private letter rulings also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation would qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the private letter rulings tyco international obtained opinions from outside legal counsel confirming the taxfree status of the distribution and certain internal transactions the private letter rulings and the opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us tyco international and covidien regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in stock or asset ownership after the distribution if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable tyco international would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common shares and covidien common shares distributed to tyco international shareholders on the distribution date over tyco internationals tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however we would incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation should be treated as taxable transactions 

in addition under the terms of the tax sharing agreement in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the distribution by us tyco international or covidien the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us tyco international or covidien as a result thereof if such determination is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us tyco international or covidien then we tyco international or covidien would be responsible for 31 27 and 42 respectively of any taxes imposed on us tyco international or covidien as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant in the event that any party to the tax sharing agreement defaults in its obligation to pay distribution taxes to another party that arise as a result of no partys fault each nondefaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting partys obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other partys taxes 

risks relating to our swiss jurisdiction of incorporation 

  legislative and other proposals in switzerland the united states and other jurisdictions could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

various us and nonus legislative proposals and other initiatives have been directed at companies incorporated in lowertax jurisdictions we believe that recently there has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and other initiatives if adopted these proposed changes could 

materially increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate we believe that since becoming a swiss corporation in june 2009 we are less likely to be subject to such legislation and other initiatives because switzerland has both a generally imposed corporate income tax and comprehensive tax treaties with the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate however we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation or initiative and we cannot assure you that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us 

  legislation in the united states could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

various us federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to us companies that have moved to lowertax jurisdictions 

we expect the us congress to continue to consider implementation andor expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad we believe that we are less likely to be subject to such proposals since becoming a swiss corporation in june 2009 however we cannot predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals therefore we cannot assure you that any such legislative action will not apply to us in addition we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to us federal or state governments or the willingness of our nongovernmental customers to do business with us as a result of these uncertainties we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot assure you that the impact will not be materially adverse to us 

  as a swiss corporation we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management 

as a swiss corporation our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements our articles of association authorize us to create authorized share capital that can be issued by the board of directors but this authorization is limited to i authorized share capital up to 50 of the existing registered shares with such authorization valid for a maximum of two years which authorization period ends on june 22 2011 and is subject to shareholder approval for a twoyear extension again at our next annual general meeting of shareholders and ii conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from authorized share capital and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares from conditional share capital swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation dividends andor voting moreover under swiss law we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convene a meeting of shareholders which would delay the timing to execute such actions such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management while we do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to our capital management will have an adverse 

effect on us we cannot assure you that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders 

  swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

we are organized under the laws of switzerland it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states and switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters some remedies available under the laws of united states jurisdictions including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws would not be allowed in swiss courts as they are contrary to that nations public policy 

swiss corporate law which applies to us differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers thus holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

risks relating to our shares 

  the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely 

the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors including 

• our quarterly or annual earnings • changes in quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results • volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global economic conditions • changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates • changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles • announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions and • the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies   we might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

in order to make distributions on our shares to shareholders free of swiss withholding tax we anticipate making any future distributions to shareholders prior to june 1 2011 through a reduction of registered share capital or after june 1 2011 through a reduction of registered share capital or contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax purposes distributions to our shareholders in the form of a reduction of registered share capital are not subject to swiss withholding tax to date since we became a swiss corporation all distributions on our shares approved by our shareholders have been distributions through reductions in our registered share capital there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from 

contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax purposes or through a reduction of registered share capital or that swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited 

  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

under swiss corporate law we are required to state our year end unconsolidated swiss statutory financial statements in swiss francs although distributions that are effected through a return of registered share capital or contributed surplus are expected to be paid in us dollars shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions are required to be stated in swiss francs if the us dollar were to increase in value relative to the swiss franc the us dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without swiss withholding tax will decrease 

  we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares 

the swiss code of obligations regulates a corporations ability to hold or repurchase its own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation 

  registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings 

our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by swiss law for swiss companies like us that issue registered shares as opposed to bearer shares this provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights holders of our shares must be registered in our share register aktienbuch as shareholders with voting rights only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders meetings but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends distributions preemptive rights advance subscription rights and liquidation proceeds the board of directors may in its discretion refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements as set forth in our articles of association 

  certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable 

our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered antitakeover provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors under these provisions among others 

• shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent and • restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15 or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors both of which provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or 

delaying deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorably by our shareholders our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital in either case representing a maximum of 50 of the shares presently registered in the commercial register and in the case of issuances from authorized capital until june 22 2011 unless reauthorized by shareholders for a subsequent twoyear period without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders preemptive rights or advance subscription rights for the purpose of the defense of an actual threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid in relation to which the board of directors upon consultation with an independent financial advisor has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders we note that swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital in addition the new york stock exchange on which our shares are listed requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power with limited exceptions

manufacturing 

we manufacture our products in over 20 countries worldwide these manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of the manufacturing processes including our primary processes of stamping plating molding extrusion beaming and assembly we expect to continue to migrate our manufacturing activities to lowercost countries as our customers requirements shift in addition we will continue to look for efficiencies to reduce our manufacturing costs and believe that we can achieve cost reductions through improved manufacturing efficiency and through the migration of manufacturing to lowercost countries 

our centers of manufacturing output at september 24 2010 included sites in the following countries 



we estimate that our manufacturing production by region in fiscal 2010 was approximately americas—30 europemiddle eastafrica—40 and asiapacific—30 

we expect that manufacturing production will continue to increase in the asiapacific region as a percentage of total manufacturing as this region continues to experience strong growth and our customers manufacturing continues to migrate to the region 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

tyco electronics legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including antitrust claims product liability matters environmental matters employment disputes disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes in addition we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims at any given time in the ordinary course of business we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions if infringement of a third partys patent were to be determined against us we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products if a patent owned by or licensed to us were 

determined to be invalid or unenforceable we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our balance sheet and to record a corresponding charge which could be significant in amount 

management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows however one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial positions or cash flows in a future period 

legal matters under separation and distribution agreement 

the separation and distribution agreement among us tyco international and covidien provided for the allocation among the parties of tyco internationals assets liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to our and covidiens separations from tyco international on june 29 2007 under the separation and distribution agreement we assumed the liability for and control of all pending and threatened legal matters at separation related to our business or assumed or retained liabilities tyco electronics was responsible for 31 of certain liabilities that arose from litigation pending or threatened at separation that was not allocated to one of the three parties and tyco international and covidien were responsible for 27 and 42 respectively of such liabilities if any party defaults in payment of its allocated share of any such liability each nondefaulting party will be responsible for an equal portion of the amount in default together with any other nondefaulting party although any such payments will not release the obligation of the defaulting party subject to the terms and conditions of the separation and distribution agreement tyco international manages and controls all the legal matters related to the shared contingent liabilities including the defense or settlement thereof subject to certain limitations all costs and expenses that tyco international incurs in connection with the defense of such litigation other than the amount of any judgment or settlement which is allocated in the manner described above will be borne equally by tyco international covidien and us at the present time all significant matters for which we shared responsibility with tyco international and covidien under the separation and distribution agreement which as previously reported in our periodic filings generally related to securities class action cases and other securities cases have been settled other than matters described below under compliance matters we presently are not aware of any additional legal matters which may arise for which we would bear a portion of the responsibility under the separation and distribution agreement

litigation matters related to our former wireless systems business 

state of new york contract 

on september 19 2005 our former wireless systems business was awarded a twentyyear lease contract with the state of new york the state to construct operate and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders on august 29 2008 we were served by the state with a default notice related to the first regional network pursuant to the contract under the terms of the contract we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the state on october 16 2008 we informed the state that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified the system ready for testing the state conducted further testing during november and december 2008 on january 15 2009 the state notified us that in the states opinion we had not fully remediated the issues cited by the state and it had determined that we were in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract the state contends that it has the right under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the state in conjunction with the implementation of the network and as a result of this contention on january 16 2009 the state drew down 50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us the state has the ability to draw up to an additional 50 million against the standby letter of credit although we dispute that the state has any basis to do so 

on february 13 2009 we filed a claim in the new york court of claims seeking over 100 million in damages and alleging a number of causes of action including breach of contract unjust enrichment defamation conversion breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing the imposition of a constructive trust and seeking a declaration that the state terminated the contract for convenience in september 2009 the court granted the states motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint with the exception of the breach of contract claims in november 2009 the state filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim asserting breach of contract and alleging that the state has incurred damages in excess of 275 million we moved to dismiss the counterclaim in february 2010 and in june 2010 the court denied our motion we filed our answer to the states counterclaim in july 2010 we believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend to vigorously pursue our claims in this matter 

comnet 

at september 24 2010 we had a contingent purchase price commitment of 80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of comnet this represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of comnet only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the state of florida is finished and the state of florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers however the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in june 2006 in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania which is in the motion pleading and discovery phase

manufacturing simplification 

since our separation we have been working on the simplification of our global manufacturing footprint by migrating facilities from highercost to lowercost countries consolidating within countries and transferring product lines to lowercost countries these initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry improve our operating leverage and position us for profitability growth in the years ahead 

in connection with our manufacturing simplification plan we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately 30 million in fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2010 cash spending related to restructuring was 190 million and we anticipate spending approximately 130 million in fiscal 2011 relating to both manufacturing simplification and prior year business resizing annualized cost savings related to the manufacturing simplification plan are expected to be approximately 20 million these costs exclude potential restructuring costs that may arise from the acquisition of adc 

correction of immaterial errors 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 we identified certain errors in our accounting for income taxes these errors related to the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 income taxes  in fiscal 2008 and data utilized in the determination of our income tax provision in fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2009 

in connection with the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 we failed to reflect in the calculation of interest and penalties the impact of the interest component of a prepayment made to the irs in fiscal 2007 as a result of this error we overstated deferred tax assets receivable from tyco international ltd and covidien plc noncurrent income taxes payable and other income by 64 million 81 million 182 million and 81 million respectively and understated accumulated earnings by 118 million in fiscal 2008 the impacts to other income and receivable from tyco international ltd and covidien plc result from the shared nature of the tax liabilities pursuant to the tax sharing agreement entered into upon separation from tyco international 

we also identified errors in certain reports used in part to determine our income tax provision as a result of these errors we understated income tax expense and overstated deferred tax assets by 9 million 14 million 13 million 12 million and 9 million in fiscal 2009 2008 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

we evaluated the effects of these errors individually and in the aggregate and determined that our prior period financial statements are not materially misstated however we determined that the cumulative effect of correcting these errors in fiscal 2010 would be material to the fiscal 2010 financial statements therefore we corrected these errors in the affected prior periods and presented the results in this annual report see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the correction of immaterial errors 

nongaap financial measures 

organic net sales growth which is included in the discussion below is a nongaap financial measure the difference between reported net sales growth the most comparable gaap measure and organic net sales growth the nongaap measure consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates acquisitions and divestitures organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business it excludes items that are not completely under managements control such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company such as acquisition and divestiture activity 

we believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business furthermore it provides investors with a view of our operations from managements perspective we use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations management uses organic net sales growth together with gaap measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations the discussion and analysis of organic net sales growth in results of operations below utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies organic net sales growth amounts presented below may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies organic net sales growth is a nongaap financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures the primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales this limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our gaap net sales the tables presented in 

results of operations below provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under gaap 

results of operations 

consolidated operations 

key business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this report include 

• raw material price increases we purchased approximately 160 million pounds of copper and 200000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2010 during the periods shown copper and gold prices as well as the prices of certain other raw materials have been volatile and current year prices have increased from prior year levels the following table sets forth the average prices incurred related to copper and gold during the periods presented 



in fiscal 2011 we expect to purchase approximately 170 million pounds of copper and 180000 troy ounces of gold 

• foreign exchange approximately 57 of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into us dollars at the end of each fiscal period the percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 by major currencies invoiced was as follows 



the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations and the percentage of net sales that such items represent for the periods shown 



net sales net sales increased 1814 million or 177 to 12070 million in fiscal 2010 from 10256 million in fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2009 net sales decreased 4117 million or 286 to 10256 million from 14373 million in fiscal 2008 on an organic basis net sales increased 1712 million or 167 in fiscal 2010 the increase primarily resulted from strong growth in our electronic components segment and to a lesser degree our specialty products segment partially offset by a decline in our subsea communications segment on an organic basis net sales decreased 3542 million or 246 in fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of declines in our electronic components specialty products and network solutions segments in fiscal 2010 foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by 188 million or 18 foreign currency exchange rates primarily the euro negatively impacted net sales by 474 million or 33 in fiscal 2009 price erosion adversely affected net sales by 169 million 187 million and 187 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively see further discussion below under results of operations by segment

gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 313 in fiscal 2010 as compared to 247 in fiscal 2009 the increase was due primarily to higher sales and improved manufacturing productivity and to a lesser degree favorable product mix and cost reductions achieved from restructuring actions implemented during fiscal 2009 

in fiscal 2009 gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 247 from 290 in fiscal 2008 the decrease was due to sales declines and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels related to lower sales and our efforts to reduce inventory levels partially offset by cost reductions from restructuring actions 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 127 and 137 in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively fiscal 2009 results included a net loss of approximately 50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern european currencies excluding this item selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010 further decreased as a percentage of net sales as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of increased sales and cost reductions achieved from restructuring actions implemented during fiscal 2009

research development and engineering expenses research development and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 48 in fiscal 2010 from 52 in fiscal 2009 the decrease as a percentage of net sales was attributable to higher net sales partially offset by increased investment in research and development across our businesses during fiscal 2010 research development and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 52 in fiscal 2009 as compared to 41 in fiscal 2008 the increase as a percentage of net sales was due to decreases in sales volume as well as our continued focus on future technologies within all four of our operating segments in fiscal 2009 

restructuring and other charges net in fiscal 2010 net restructuring and other charges were 137 million as compared to 375 million in fiscal 2009 and 219 million in fiscal 2008 total charges including amounts reflected in cost of sales were 134 million 373 million and 228 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively

income taxes 

our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world we have provided for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation in fiscal 2009 we changed our place of incorporation from bermuda to switzerland we do not expect the change to materially impact our tax provision or cash tax burden 

our effective income tax rate was 316 for fiscal 2010 and reflects a charge of 307 million primarily associated with certain proposed adjustments to prior year income tax returns and related accrued interest partially offset by an income tax benefit of 101 million recognized in connection with the completion of certain nonus audits of prior year income tax returns in addition the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 reflects an income tax benefit of 72 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss carryforwards in certain nonus locations

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 2236 million and 2487 million at fiscal year end 2010 and 2009 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss capital loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of asc 740 which require that a valuation allowance be 

established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest further management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement income tax benefits may be recognized 

we have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries earnings that are expected to be distributed in fiscal 2011 no additional provision has been made for us or nonus income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested the investments are essentially permanent in duration or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings as of september 24 2010 certain subsidiaries had approximately 14 billion of undistributed earnings that we intend to permanently reinvest a liability could arise if our intentions to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed it is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries

commitments and contingencies 

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt minimum lease payment obligations under noncancelable leases and other obligations at fiscal year end 2010 



1 interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps 2 purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services 3 the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of 1689 million and related accrued interest and penalties of 1252 million the timing of which is uncertain see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits interest and penalties 4 the table above does not reflect pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees we are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans however we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type including timing interest rate charges investment performance and amounts of benefit payments we expect to contribute 70 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2011 before consideration of voluntary contributions these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 5 other longterm liabilities of 452 million of which 205 million related to our asc 460 liability are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding asc 460 

income tax matters 

in connection with the separation we entered into a tax sharing agreement that generally governs covidiens tyco electronics and tyco internationals respective rights responsibilities and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes if any incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of covidien or tyco electronics to qualify as a taxfree distribution for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoffs to qualify for taxfavored treatment under the code 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and tax sharing agreement upon separation we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and covidien under these agreements principally the tax sharing agreement tyco international covidien and tyco electronics share 27 42 and 31 respectively of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters of tyco international the effect of the tax sharing agreement is to indemnify us for 69 of certain liabilities settled in cash by tyco electronics with respect to unresolved preseparation tax matters pursuant to that indemnification we have made similar indemnifications to tyco international and covidien with respect to 31 of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party 

or parties obligation we are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula in addition tyco international and covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the tax sharing agreements sharing formula 

prior to separation certain of our subsidiaries filed combined tax returns with tyco international those and other of our subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities in connection with these examinations tax authorities including the irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments tyco international as the us income tax audit controlling party under the tax sharing agreement is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 which relate specifically to tyco electronics entities have been recorded on the consolidated financial statements in addition we may be required to fund portions of covidien and tyco internationals tax obligations estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the consolidated financial statements see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in prior years in connection with the irs audit of various fiscal years tyco international submitted to the irs proposed adjustments to these prior period us federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed the irs accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments for fiscal 1997 through 2000 for which the irs had completed its field work on the basis of previously accepted amendments we have determined that acceptance of adjustments presented for additional periods through fiscal 2006 is more likely than not to be accepted and accordingly have recorded them as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the irs on the consolidated financial statements 

in fiscal 2009 certain proposed adjustments to us federal income tax returns were completed by tyco international and in connection with these adjustments we recorded a 97 million increase in income tax liabilities a 10 million increase in deferred tax assets a 60 million increase in the receivable from tyco international and covidien in connection with the tax sharing agreement and a 27 million charge to contributed surplus see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the indemnification liability to tyco international and covidien 

as our tax return positions continue to be updated for periods prior to separation additional adjustments may be identified and recorded on the consolidated financial statements while the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows additionally adjustments may be recorded to shareholders equity in the future for the impact of filing final or amended income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of tyco international covidien andor our subsidiaries for the periods prior to the separation 

during fiscal 2007 the irs concluded its field examination of certain of tyco internationals us federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued revenue agent reports which reflect the irs determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period tyco international has appealed certain proposed adjustments totaling approximately 1 billion additionally the irs proposed civil fraud penalties against tyco international arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999 based upon statutory guidelines tyco international estimates the proposed penalties could range between 30 million and 50 million and it is our understanding that tyco international is vigorously opposing the assertion of any such penalties the penalty is asserted against a prior subsidiary of tyco international that was distributed to tyco electronics in connection with the separation any penalty ultimately imposed upon the tyco electronics subsidiary would be subject to sharing with tyco international and covidien under the tax sharing agreement it is our understanding that tyco 

international has made progress during fiscal 2010 towards resolving a substantial number of the proposed tax adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000 however several significant matters remain in dispute the primary issues in dispute involve the tax treatment of certain intercompany transactions if tyco international is not able to resolve these contested adjustments through the irs appeals process it may choose to litigate the disputed issues in addition tyco international could settle with the irs and pay any related deficiencies for the undisputed tax adjustments within the next twelve months 

the irs continues to audit certain tyco international income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 and is nearing completion of its fieldwork for this period it is possible that the audit for the years 2001 through 2004 will conclude within the next twelve months during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 tyco international settled a matter with the irs concerning certain tax deductions claimed on tyco internationals income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 as a result of this settlement we recorded a 28 million income tax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 to reflect the disallowance of a portion of these deductions 

we have reflected 244 million of liabilities related to the audits of tyco internationals income tax returns for 1997 through 2000 and 2001 through 2004 in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within one year it is anticipated that the irs will commence its audit of certain tyco international income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011 

we continue to believe that the amounts recorded on our consolidated financial statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate however the ultimate resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

legal matters 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including patent infringement claims antitrust claims product liability matters environmental matters employment disputes disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings based upon our experience current information and applicable law we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows however one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in a future period see part i item 3 legal proceedings and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding legal proceedings 

matters related to our former wireless systems business 

certain liabilities and contingencies related to our former wireless systems business were retained by us when this business was sold in fiscal 2009 these include certain retained liabilities related to the state of new york contract and a contingent purchase price commitment related to the acquisition of comnet by the wireless systems business in 2001 see additional information below also see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the wireless systems business 

state of new york contract 

on september 19 2005 our former wireless systems business was awarded a twentyyear lease contract with the state of new york to construct operate and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders on august 29 2008 we were served by the state with a default notice related to the first regional network pursuant to the contract under the terms of the contract we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the state on october 16 2008 we informed the state that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified the system ready for testing the state conducted further testing during november and december 2008 on january 15 2009 the state notified us that in the states opinion we had not fully remediated the issues cited by the state and it had determined that we were in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract the state contends that it has the right under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the state in conjunction with the implementation of the network and as a result of this contention on january 16 2009 the state drew down 50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us the state has the ability to draw up to an additional 50 million against the standby letter of credit although we dispute that the state has any basis to do so 

on february 13 2009 we filed a claim in the new york court of claims seeking over 100 million in damages and alleging a number of causes of action including breach of contract unjust enrichment defamation conversion breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing the imposition of a constructive trust and seeking a declaration that the state terminated the contract for convenience in september 2009 the court granted the states motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint with the exception of the breach of contract claims in november 2009 the state filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim asserting breach of contract and alleging that the state has incurred damages in excess of 275 million we moved to dismiss the counterclaim in february 2010 and in june 2010 the court denied our motion we filed our answer to the states counterclaim in july 2010 we believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend to vigorously pursue our claims in this matter 

as a result of these actions in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded pretax charges totaling 111 million associated with this contract these charges are reflected in loss from discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of operations as a result of our sale of the wireless systems business see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of discontinued operations and the sale of the wireless systems business the charges included an impairment charge of 61 million to writeoff all costs incurred in constructing the network as well as a charge equal to the amount drawn by the state against the standby letter of credit of 50 million the assets related to the impairment charge were previously reflected primarily as inventories on the consolidated balance sheet 

comnet 

at september 24 2010 we had a contingent purchase price commitment of 80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of comnet this represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of comnet only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the state of florida is finished and the state of florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers however the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in june 2006 in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania which is in the motion pleading and discovery phase a liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the consolidated financial statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or estimable at this time 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

certain of our segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments the terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2011 through the completion of such transactions the guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions however we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

as of september 24 2010 we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of 390 million of which 50 million was related to our contract with the state of new york 

we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these liabilities 

in the normal course of business we are liable for contract completion and product performance in the opinion of management except for the charges related to the contract with the state of new york discussed below such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in january 2009 the state of new york drew down 50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us as a result we recorded a pretax charge equal to the draw although we dispute that the state has any basis to do so the state has the ability to draw up to an additional 50 million against the standby letter of credit which could result in additional charges and could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and tax sharing agreement upon separation we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and covidien under these agreements principally the tax sharing agreement tyco international covidien and tyco electronics share 27 42 and 31 respectively of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters of tyco international the effect of the tax sharing agreement is to indemnify us for 69 of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved preseparation tax matters pursuant to that indemnification we have made similar indemnifications to tyco international and covidien with respect to 31 of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved preseparation tax matters if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation these arrangements have been valued upon our separation from tyco international in accordance with asc 460 and accordingly liabilities amounting to 339 million were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at september 24 2010 see notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we generally record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding estimated product warranty 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses our significant accounting policies are summarized in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements the following noted accounting policies are based on among other things judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 

revenue recognition 

our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with asc 605 revenue recognition  and sec staff accounting bulletin nos 101 and 104 

our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer this generally occurs when the products reach the freeonboard shipping point the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured for those items where title has not yet transferred we have deferred the recognition of revenue a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies a reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales 

contract revenues for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentageofcompletion method profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete percentageofcompletion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable contract revenues for construction related projects are generated primarily within our subsea communications segment 

inventories 

inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value except for inventoried costs which are costs incurred in the performance of longterm contracts primarily by our subsea communications segment provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based upon product demand and historical experience should future product demand change existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents trademarks and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 1 to 50 years that are amortized generally on a straightline basis an evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation we assess intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other longlived assets goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred in assessing the existence of a triggering event management relies on a number of factors including operating results business plans 

economic projections anticipated future cash flows transactions and market place data there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

when testing for goodwill impairment we follow the guidance prescribed in asc 350 intangibles—goodwill and other  first we perform a step i goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment in doing so we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill may be impaired and a step ii goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss in the step ii goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 

estimates about fair value used in the step i goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit the income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction and guideline analyses these approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates discount rates and income tax rates in assessing fair value changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and determined that no impairment existed and that the fair value of all reporting units to which goodwill is allocated is well in excess of the respective carrying value 

income taxes 

in determining income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state federal and international pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings prior to september 26 2009 if a change in a valuation allowance occurred which was established in connection with an acquisition the adjustment of such 

allowance may have affected goodwill rather than the income tax provision subsequent to the adoption of the business combination provisions of asc 805 business combinations  on september 26 2009 any changes in a valuation allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition regardless of when the acquisition occurred will be reflected in the income tax provision 

changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations under the uncertain tax position provisions of asc 740 income taxes  we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and related interest will be due these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest further management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement an additional charge to income tax expense may result if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement income tax benefits may be recognized these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 

pension and postretirement benefits 

our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions the funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date for defined benefit pension plans the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on estimated future compensation levels for the postretirement benefit plans the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered the fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds held for the sole benefit of participants which are invested by the trust funds our contribution amounts are actuarially determined 

net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the consolidated statements of operations on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants 

two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected longterm return on plan assets we evaluate these assumptions at least annually other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement mortality and employee turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for highquality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our 

present value of pension obligations by 127 million while a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our present value of pension obligations by 122 million we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans as well as historical and expected longterm rates of return on those types of plan assets in determining the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a 50 basis point decrease in the expected longterm return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by 9 million while a 50 basis point increase in the expected longterm return on plan assets would decrease our pension expense by 9 million 

during fiscal 2008 our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the us plans master trust from 60 equity and 40 fixed income to 30 equity and 70 fixed income in an effort to better align asset risk with the anticipated payment of benefit obligations the target asset allocation transition began in fiscal 2008 as of september 24 2010 our actual asset allocation is approximately 45 equity and 55 fixed income asset reallocation will continue over a multiyear period based on the funded status of the us plans master trust and market conditions 

sharebased compensation 

under asc 718 compensation—stock compensation  we determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant using the blackscholesmerton valuation model the blackscholesmerton model requires certain assumptions that involve judgment such assumptions are the expected share price volatility expected annual dividend yield expected life of options and riskfree interest rate see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to sharebased compensation an increase in the volatility of our stock will increase the amount of compensation expense on new awards an increase in the holding period of options will also cause an increase in compensation expense dividend yields and riskfree interest rates are less difficult to estimate but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in expense and an increase in the riskfree interest rate will increase compensation expense 

accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in december 2008 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updates to the guidance in asc 715 compensation—retirement benefits  that enhance disclosures regarding assets in defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans the updates to asc 715 are effective for us in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to fair value measurement of assets in defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements we utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks 

we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an aa2 longterm debt rating there is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty 

foreign currency exposures 

as part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we use foreign currency forward and swap contracts the objective is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany transactions accounts receivable accounts payable and other cash transactions a 10 appreciation of the us dollar from the september 24 2010 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 12 million while a 10 depreciation of the us dollar would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 15 million a 10 appreciation of the us dollar from the september 25 2009 market rates would have decreased the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 2 million while a 10 depreciation of the us dollar would have increased the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 2 million such gains or losses on these contracts would be generally offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions 

interest rate and investment exposures 

we issue debt from time to time in capital and money markets to fund our operations and capital needs such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure to manage the interest rate exposure and to minimize overall interest cost we use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of fixedrate debt into variable rate debt via fair value hedge designation andor convert a portion of variable rate debt into fixedrate debt via cash flow hedge designation we use forward starting interest rate swaps and swaptions to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixedrate debt via cash flow hedge designation we also utilize interest rate swap and swaption contracts a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges to manage interest rate exposure on cash and cash equivalents and we utilize a swap to manage exposure related to certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities 

during fiscal 2010 we purchased options to enter into interest rate swaps swaptions and entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure prior to the probable issuance of fixedrate debt when our 600 senior notes mature in fiscal 2012 the swaptions and forward starting interest rate swaps are based on a total notional amount of 400 million also during fiscal 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge on 50 million principal amount of the 600 senior notes based on our floating rate debt balance of 150 million at september 24 2010 an increase in the levels of the us dollar interest rates by 05 with all other variables held constant would result in an increase of annual interest expense of approximately 1 million at september 25 2009 we had no floating rate debt outstanding 

commodity exposures 

our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows we utilize commodity swap contracts all of which are designated as cash flow hedges we continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next twelve to twentyfour months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts in order to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period at september 24 2010 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold and silver were in a gain position of 12 million and had a notional value of 108 million at september 25 2009 our commodity hedges which related to expected purchases of gold were in a gain position of 1 million and had a notional value of 29 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold and a troy ounce of silver from the september 24 2010 prices would change the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 12 million a 10 appreciation or depreciation of the price of a troy ounce of gold from the september 25 2009 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 3 million
