with this foundation occidental’s human capital resources and programs are managed by our human resources department with support from business leaders across the company occidental’s senior management team plays a key role in setting and monitoring occidental’s culture values and broader human capital management practices with oversight by our board of directors senior management and the board of directors also engage frequently on workforcerelated topics 

diversity inclusion and belonging 

occidental’s culture of diversity inclusion and belonging dib supports an environment where employees’ differences are not only appreciated but also celebrated and encouraged with the goal that all employees are included and everyone feels that they belong occidental conducted a robust survey across the organization in 2020 the results of which were reviewed with our board of directors and became a basis for our company’s core values 





occidental’s human capital resources extend across several regions occidental has attracted and continues to recruit a diverse workforce of exceptional talent including employees from many nations this diversity enriches our culture our employees experiences on the job and contributes to an innovative and effective business model that encourages local communities to thrive dib powers our innovation and spirit of excellence as well as our knowledge and results embedding dib into our culture enhances occidental’s collaboration performance and growth and helps uphold our organizational values 

in the first quarter of 2021 occidental established the dib advisory board and the dib ambassador committee the dib advisory board which is chaired by occidental’s president and ceo and includes members of senior leadership provides dib governance and oversight to ensure that occidental’s integrated dib strategy is executed and properly aligns with the organization’s mission vision and strategic objectives the dib ambassador committee which is chaired by occidental’s vice president of diversity and inclusion consists of a diverse group of employee representatives from all business segments domestic and international this committee leads companywide initiatives to raise dib awareness through educational resources and programs robust educational sessions are available to our entire workforce for continued growth and development on topics such as inclusive leadership diversity advocacy recognizing and addressing micro aggressions overcoming unconscious bias and psychological safety at work

covid19 response 

occidental and the communities in which we operate continue to be impacted by the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic and emergence and spread of new variants of the virus throughout the pandemic occidental has remained committed to ensuring the safety of our employees and communities while continuing to operate critical national infrastructure and supply essential products 

senior management and the human resources department have been actively monitoring federal state and local guidance and public health data in march 2020 occidental announced a workfromhome wfh program for certain domestic officebased employees on november 2 2021 employees returned to inoffice work on a regular basis with covid19 safety measures in place including a mandatory face covering requirement in common areas and enhanced office cleanings however given the surge in covid19 cases with the omicron variant occidental announced the reimplementation of a wfh schedule for certain domestic officebased employees effective december 21 2021 through march 1 2022 

understanding the impact of covid19 illnesses on our employees and their families occidental also instituted “pandemic pay” benefits which provide employees with up to 14 days of paid leave if unable to work due to covid19 related issues 

talent attraction and retention 

occidental is dedicated to attracting and retaining top talent in 2021 occidental expanded source channels for employee candidates to include three historically black colleges and universities 

during covid19 outbreaks in our local communities occidental also efficiently conducted interviews job fairs and campus recruiting virtually similarly all college interns participated in virtual internships for health and safety reasons during 2020 and 2021 for 2022 our university relations team will work with universities and their staff to ensure that any inperson interviews and events are conducted safely in addition all college internships are currently set to be inperson later this year though we will continue to monitor federal state and local guidance and public health data 

despite the challenges introduced by covid19 to interact inperson with others management continues to encourage employee engagement and feedback for example in late 2020 senior management began hosting quarterly executive virtual conversations which provide employees the opportunity to hear directly from leadership regarding financial and operational updates and submit questions for management to answer 

in response to employee feedback received by the human resources department occidental implemented the balanced workplace program under which eligible officebased employees may opt to work three days in the office and two days at home each week the program affords employees more flexibility and promotes increased worklife balance 

in 2021 occidental implemented its global strategic technical excellence program step to recruit develop and retain highly skilled and valued geoscientists engineers scientists and other petrotechnical professionals who will collectively drive innovation advance performance and inspire the future of energy step drives a competitive advantage and increased profitability for occidental through the optimum application of technology step is a highly valued program for technical contributors to focus and advance on a technical nonmanagerial career path the chief petrotechnical officer leads all aspects of step and reports directly to occidental’s president and ceo

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to government regulations and the environment 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and the ultimate effect on our operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility in the financial markets while the worldwide economy continues to be impacted by the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic and emergence and spread of new variants of the virus demand for oil and gas products has increased with the lifting of certain restrictions including certain travel restrictions and stayathome orders current crude oil ngl and natural gas demand and prices could be negatively impacted by a resurgence of covid19 cases slow vaccine distribution in certain large international economies or the recurrence or tightening of travel restrictions and stayathome orders if reduced demand for and lower prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas persist for a prolonged period our operations financial condition cash flows level of expenditures and the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties may be materially and adversely affected our operations also may be adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work or work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions vaccine mandates or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic as a result of higher vaccination rates and lower infection rates in 2021 we lifted certain workplace restrictions implemented in the initial stages of the pandemic and implemented new workplace safety protocols and procedures in our offices and work sites to help mitigate the spread of covid19 amongst our workforce we continue to monitor national state and local government directives where we have operations andor offices and have reinstituted a wfh schedule effective december 21 2021 through march 1 2022 for certain domestic officebased employees in light of the omicron variant occidental has not experienced any significant disruptions as a result of any new covid19 variants the extent to which the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic the covid19 pandemic may also materially adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations to the extent the covid19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business operations financial condition and operating results it may also have the effect of heightening the other risks described herein 

governmental actions and political instability may affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s businesses are subject to the actions and decisions of many federal state local and international governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 

■ new or amended laws and regulations or new or different applications or interpretations of existing laws and regulations including those related to drilling manufacturing or production processes including flaring and well stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and acidization pipelines labor and employment taxes royalty rates permitted production rates entitlements import export and use of raw materials equipment or products use or increased use of land water and other natural resources air emissions water recycling and disposal waste minimization and disposal safety the manufacturing of chemicals asset integrity management the marketing or export of commodities security environmental protection and climate changerelated and sustainability initiatives all of which may restrict or prohibit activities of occidental or its contractors increase occidental’s costs or reduce demand for occidental’s products in addition violation of certain governmental laws and regulations may result in strict joint and several liability and the imposition of significant civil and criminal fines and penalties 

■ refusal of or delay in the extension or grant of exploration development or production contracts and 

■ development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for or denial of drilling construction environmental and other regulatory approvals permits and authorizations 





in november 2021 congress passed and president biden signed the infrastructure investment and jobs act this law reinstates the federal superfund excise taxes on various chemicals that oxychem manufactures these excise taxes could lead to higher costs and impact margins 

in november 2021 the house of representatives passed the build back better act bbb which contains several climaterelated provisions while the bbb was not enacted in 2021 renewed efforts are expected in 2022 to legislate bbb or portions thereof provisions if any that reduce demand for oil and gas could negatively affect occidental’s revenue 

in november 2021 the us department of the interior doi released its report on the federal oil and gas leasing program recommending increasing royalty rates and rents for drilling programs on federal public lands and in federal offshore waters in addition to prioritizing leasing in areas with known resource potential and in proximity to existing oil and gas infrastructure and avoiding leasing in areas with competing uses such as recreation wildlife habitat conservation and historical and cultural resources if enacted the regulations could increase royalties payable to the federal government and limit future potential drilling sites 

in january 2022 the us district court for the district of columbia issued a decision to invalidate the results of bureau of ocean energy management’s oil and gas lease sale in the gulf of mexico of which occidental was the high bidder on 30 additional new blocks located nearby to its existing host platforms ruling that the environmental analysis of ghg emissions was inadequate under the national environmental policy act nepa the doi which oversees federal oil and gas development is currently reviewing the decision the decision does not affect occidental’s existing leases or operations but restrictions or uncertainty regarding federal lease sales and associated nepa requirements could impact the ability to develop resources in areas outside of existing leases 

in january 2021 the colorado oil and gas conservation commission cogcc adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements or “setbacks” on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures pursuant to the regulations well pads cannot be located within 500 feet of an occupied structure without the consent of the property owner as part of the permitting process the cogcc will consider a series of siting requirements for all drilling locations located between 500 feet and 2000 feet of an occupied structure alternatively the operator may seek a waiver from each owner and tenant within the designated distance occidental has a dedicated multidisciplinary stakeholder relations team that conducts regulatory and community outreach with respect to its permit applications and operations in colorado while occidental has not been denied any permits and received its first approved oil and gas development plan permit under the new state regulations in the fourth quarter of 2021 any significant delays could result in changes to our development program in the dj basin and our ability to establish new proved undeveloped pud locations by meeting the sec’s “reasonably certain” threshold for adding pud reserves 

texas and new mexico have experienced an increase in seismic activity with events measuring magnitude 3 or greater in each state in the fourth quarter of 2021 both states issued new guidelines for operators to prevent or mitigate seismic activity focused on produced water disposal wells these guidelines also require operators to implement response plans for activities within agencydesignated seismic response areas these states have curtailed water disposal and suspended permits in seismic response areas particularly in deep disposal wells occidental does not operate deep disposal wells in the seismic response areas established by the state agencies to date and its shallow disposal wells have been authorized to operate at agencyapproved volume limits occidental also has central water treatment and recycling facilities that reduce the need for disposal of produced water while occidental’s ability to drill and complete wells or to dispose of surplus produced water has not been impacted by these seismic guidelines to date increased seismicity or regulatory responses to seismic events could impact the location timing and cost of occidental’s development program and existing operations in seismic response areas 

in addition occidental has experienced and may continue to experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability nationalizations corruption armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources 

climate change and further regulation of ghg and other air emissions may adversely affect occidental’s operations or results 

continuing political social and industry attention to climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional and local legislation and regulatory programs to reduce ghg emissions in december 2009 the environmental protection agency epa determined that co 2  methane and other ghg emissions endanger public health and the environment because they contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes based on these findings the epa began adopting and implementing regulations to restrict ghg emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act the epa issued regulations in 2012 and 2016 to address methane and volatile organic compound voc emissions from certain new or modified oil and gas sources the methane provisions of which were rescinded by the trump administration’s 2020 methane policy rule the biden administration has identified climate change as a priority and has identified a variety of avenues to prohibit or restrict oil and gas development activities in certain areas in june 2021 congress and president biden rescinded the 2020 policy rule under the congressional review act reinstating the methane provisions of epa’s 2012 and 2016 regulations an action that occidental supported in november 2021 the white house office of domestic climate policy issued a us methane emissions reduction action plan that solicited public comment on the epa’s proposed framework for expanding federal regulations the proposal would regulate 





methane and voc emissions from a broader set of new upstream and midstream operations as well as various existing operations the epa is expected to issue proposed regulations in 2022 based on this framework 

several state governments have also established rules aimed at reducing ghg emissions some including ghg cap and trade programs and others directly regulating equipment that emits ghg including methane and other compounds most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels including refineries and natural gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances other us states where occidental operates including colorado new mexico and texas adopted or proposed new regulations policies or strategies in 2021 that increase inspection recordkeeping reporting enforcement and controls on flaring venting and equipment that emit methane and other compounds at oil and gas facilities in certain instances these states anticipate tying the processing and active status of oil and gas permits including drilling permits to air emissions and compliance for example colorado has established ghg intensity targets for dj basin operators in 2025 2027 and 2030 which occidental currently meets 

these and other government actions relating to ghg and other air emissions could require occidental to incur increased operating and maintenance costs including higher rates charged by service providers costs to purchase operate and maintain emissions control systems to acquire emission allowances pay carbon taxes or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements or prevent occidental from conducting oil and gas development activities in certain areas or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for oil ngl and natural gas and other products that occidental’s businesses produce any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming and thereby reduce demand for oil ngl natural gas or other products produced by occidental’s businesses and lower the value of its reserves consequently government actions designed to reduce ghg emissions could have an adverse effect on occidental’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows and reserves 

it is difficult to predict the timing certainty and scope of such government actions and their ultimate effect on occidental which could depend on among other things the type and extent of ghg emissions reductions required the availability and price of emission allowances or credits the availability and price of alternative fuel sources the energy sectors covered and occidental’s ability to recover the costs incurred through its operating agreements or the pricing of its oil ngl natural gas and other products and whether service providers are able to pass increased costs through to occidental 

there also have been efforts in the investment community including investment advisers and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds as well as political actors and other stakeholders promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities reducing access to capital markets and pressuring lenders to limit funding or increase the cost of lending to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves additionally institutional lenders who provide financing to oil and gas companies have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may substantially reduce or elect not to provide funding for oil and gas companies such environmental initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could adversely affect our business activities operations and ability to access capital and could cause the market value of our securities to decrease our cost of capital to increase and adversely affect our reputation finally increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against occidental without regard to causation or our contribution to the asserted damage which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business 

occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic events 

the occurrence of severe weather events such as hurricanes floods freezes and heat waves droughts earthquakes or other acts of nature pandemics well blowouts fires explosions pipeline ruptures chemical releases oil releases including maritime releases releases into navigable waters and groundwater contamination material or mechanical failure power outages industrial accidents physical or cyber attacks abnormally pressured or structured formations and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates coastal operations are particularly susceptible to disruption from severe weather events any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of 

■ damage to and destruction of property and equipment including property and equipment owned by thirdparties which our operations rely upon 

■ damage to natural resources 

■ pollution and other environmental damage including spillage or mishandling of recovered chemicals or fluids 

■ regulatory investigations fines and penalties 

■ loss of well location acreage expected production and related reserves 

■ suspension or delay of our operations 

■ substantial liability claims and 

■ significant repair and remediation costs that increase our breakeven economics 

thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses in addition under certain circumstances we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of properties that we own lease or operate as a result we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities for environmental matters for which we do not have insurance coverage which could reduce or 





eliminate funds available for exploration development acquisitions or other investments in our business or cause us to incur losses 

risks related to occidental’s business and operations 

volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products particularly oil and to a lesser extent ngl natural gas and its chemical products 

prices for oil ngl and natural gas fluctuate widely historically the markets for oil ngl and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future if the prices of oil ngl or natural gas continue to be volatile or decline occidental’s operations financial condition cash flows level of expenditures and the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties may be materially and adversely affected prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in occidental’s control these factors include among others 

■ worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for oil ngl natural gas and refined products 

■ the cost of exploring for developing producing refining and marketing oil ngl natural gas and refined products 

■ operational impacts such as production disruptions technological advances and regional market conditions including available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints in producing areas 

■ changes in weather patterns and climate 

■ the impacts of the members of opec and other nonopec memberproducing nations that may agree to and maintain production levels 

■ the worldwide military and political environment including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities or acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere 

■ the price and availability of and demand for alternative and competing fuels and emissions reducing technology 

■ technological advances affecting energy consumption and supply 

■ government policies and support and market demand for lowcarbon technologies 

■ domestic and international governmental regulations and taxes including those that restrict the export of hydrocarbons 

■ shareholder activism or activities by nongovernmental organizations to restrict the exploration development and production of oil ngl and natural gas 

■ additional or increased nationalization and expropriation activities by international governments 

■ the impact and uncertainty of world health events including the covid19 pandemic and the spread of new variants 

■ the effect of releases from the us strategic petroleum reserve 

■ volatility in commodity markets 

■ the effect of energy conservation efforts and 

■ global inventory levels and general economic conditions 

the longterm effects of these and other conditions on the prices of oil ngl natural gas and chemical products are uncertain and there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for occidental’s products will follow historic patterns in the nearterm prolonged or substantial decline or sustained market uncertainty in these commodity prices may have the following effects on occidental’s business 

■ adversely affect occidental’s financial condition results of operations liquidity ability to reduce debt access to and cost of capital and ability to finance planned capital expenditures pay dividends and repurchase shares 

■ reduce the amount of oil ngl and natural gas that occidental can produce economically 

■ cause occidental to delay or postpone some of its capital projects 

■ reduce occidental’s revenues operating income or cash flows 

■ reduce the amounts of occidental’s estimated proved oil ngl and natural gas reserves 

■ reduce the carrying value of occidental’s oil and natural gas properties due to recognizing impairments of proved properties unproved properties and exploration assets 

■ reduce the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil ngl and natural gas reserves and 

■ adversely affect the ability of occidental’s partners to fund their working interest capital requirements 

generally occidental’s historical practice has been to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities in 2019 occidental entered into 2020 brentpriced 3way collars combined with 2021 call options on the same volume to manage its nearterm exposure to cash flow variability from oil price risks in 2020 the 2021 call options were sold to enhance the upside retention in 2020 in 2020 management elected to hedge a portion of occidental’s expected 2021 natural gas production to enhance cash flow stability as of december 31 2021 there are no active commodity hedges in place 





management may choose to put hedges in place in the future for oil ngl and natural gas commodities commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to regulatory counterparty credit and other risks 

the prices obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate to the strength of the united states and global economies as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

occidental may experience delays cost overruns losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities 

oil ngl and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil ngl and natural gas production in its development and exploration activities occidental bears the risks of 

■ equipment failures 

■ construction delays 

■ escalating costs or competition for services materials supplies or labor 

■ property or border disputes 

■ disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance 

■ title problems and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns 

■ actions by thirdparty operators of our properties 

■ permit delays and costs of drilling wells on lands subject to complex development terms and circumstances and 

■ oil ngl and natural gas gathering transportation and processing availability restrictions or limitations 

exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses 

occidental’s oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its ability to source production and replace reserves 

results of operations reserves replacement and the level of oil and gas production depend in part on occidental’s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves occidental has many competitors including national oil companies some of which i are larger and better funded ii may be willing to accept greater risks iii have greater access to capital iv have substantially larger staffs or v have special competencies competition for access to reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts further during periods of low product prices any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts also there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry our failure to acquire properties potentially grow production replace reserves and attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 

in addition occidental’s acquisition activities carry risks that it may i not fully realize anticipated benefits due to lessthanexpected reserves or production or changed circumstances such as declines in oil ngl and natural gas prices ii bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties iii experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity or iv be subject to liabilities that are greater than anticipated 

occidental’s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability including production decline rates operating performance and economic feasibility at the prescribed weighted average commodity prices future operating costs and capital expenditures workover and remedial costs assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies the quantity quality and interpretation of relevant data taxes and availability of funds the procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants however there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves actual production revenues expenditures oil ngl and natural gas prices and taxes with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates and the variance may be material additional regulation around ghg emissions and future costs related to a lower carbon intensive economy could result in a shortened oil and gas reservoir reserve life as the underlying reserves become uneconomical if occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected 

in addition the discounted cash flows included in this form 10k should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year in accordance with sec regulations actual future prices and costs may differ materially from sec regulationcompliant prices and costs used for 





purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves also actual future net cash flows may differ from these discounted net cash flows due to the amount and timing of actual production availability of financing for capital expenditures necessary to develop our undeveloped reserves supply and demand for oil ngl and natural gas increases or decreases in consumption of oil ngl and natural gas and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 

occidental’s future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to execute new business strategies effectively 

occidental’s results of operations depend on the extent to which it can execute new business strategies effectively relative to both the larger transition to sustainable energy and government regulation regarding the environment and climate change occidental’s strategies which include the goal of reaching netzero emissions in its operations and energy use before 2040 are subject to business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond its control additionally occidental may be forced to develop or implement new technologies at substantial costs to achieve its strategies effective execution of these goals may require substantial new capital which might not be available to occidental in the amounts or at the times expected in addition raising such capital may increase our leverage or overall costs of doing business these uncertainties and costs could cause occidental to not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results and benefits of its business strategies 

certain of occidental’s emissions goals are dependent upon the successful implementation of new and existing technology on an industrial scale these technologies are in various stages of development or implementation and may require more capital or take longer to develop than currently expected further these carbon management technologies are in competition with technology being developed by other companies the carbon management solutions are not well established and while occidental believes it has access to the technology and the expertise necessary to develop these on an industrial scale occidental may not ultimately succeed in achieving its ghg emissions reduction and netzero goals 

occidental’s strategy to include carbon management in its product line is also dependent upon demand for carbon sequestration and related carbon offsets and attributes if this market does not develop or if the regulatory environment does not support carbon management activities occidental may not be successful in entering this industry 

occidental’s aspirations goals and initiatives related to carbon management and overall sustainability expose it to numerous risks 

we continue to develop new technology and strategies to meet our emissions goals our efforts to research establish accomplish and accurately report on our emissions goals targets and strategies expose occidental to numerous operational reputational financial legal and other risks our ability to reach our target emissions is subject to a multitude of factors and conditions many of which are out of our control examples of such factors include evolving government regulation the pace of changes in technology the successful development and deployment of existing or new technologies and business solutions on a commercial scale the availability timing and cost of equipment manufactured goods and services and the availability of requisite financing and federal and state incentive programs 

occidental may face increased scrutiny from the investment community other stakeholders and the media related to its emissions goals and strategies if occidental’s emissions goals and strategies to achieve them do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations or standards occidental’s reputation ability to attract and retain employees and attractiveness as an investment business partner or acquirer could be negatively impacted similarly occidental’s failure or perceived failure to fulfill its emissions goals and targets to comply with ethical environmental social governance or other standards regulations or expectations or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters effectively could have the same negative impacts and further expose occidental to government enforcement actions and private litigation even if occidental achieves its goals targets and objectives it may not realize all of the benefits that it expected at the time the goals were established 

occidental has previously recorded impairments of its proved and unproved oil and gas properties and will continue to assess further impairments in the future 

we have recorded impairments of our proved and unproved oil and gas properties resulting from prolonged declines in oil and gas prices and may record such impairments in the future past impairments included pretax impairment and related charges to both proved and unproved oil and gas properties and a lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment for crude inventory if there is an adverse downturn of the macroeconomic conditions and if such downturn is expected to or does persist for a prolonged period of time occidental’s oil and gas properties may be subject to further testing for impairment which could result in additional noncash asset impairments such impairments could be material to the financial statements 

future costs associated with reducing emissions and carbon impacts as well as impacts resulting from other risk factors described herein could lead to impairments in the future if such costs significantly increase our breakeven economics 





occidental uses co 2 for its eor operations occidental’s production from these operations may decline if occidental is not able to obtain sufficient amounts of co 2  

occidental’s co 2 eor operations are critical to occidental’s longterm strategy oil production from occidental’s co 2 eor projects depends largely on having access to sufficient amounts of naturally occurring or anthropogenic humanmade co 2  occidental’s ability to produce oil from its co 2 eor projects would be hindered if the supply of co 2 was limited due to among other things problems with current co 2 producing wells and facilities including compression equipment catastrophic pipeline failure or the ability to economically purchase naturally occurring or anthropogenic co 2  this could have a material adverse effect on occidental’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows future oil production from its co 2 eor operations is dependent on the timing volumes and location of co 2 injections and in particular occidental’s ability to obtain sufficient volumes of co 2  market conditions may cause the delay or cancellation of the development of naturally occurring co 2 sources or construction of plants that produce anthropogenic co 2 as a byproduct that can be purchased thus limiting the amount of co 2 available for use in occidental’s co 2 eor operations 

occidental is exposed to cyberrelated risks 

the oil and gas industry is increasingly dependent on digital and industrial control technologies to conduct certain exploration development and production activities occidental relies on digital and industrial control systems related infrastructure technologies and networks to run its business and to control and manage its oil and gas chemicals marketing and pipeline operations use of the internet cloud services mobile communication systems and other public networks exposes occidental’s business and that of other third parties with whom occidental does business to cyber attacks cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years 

information and industrial control technology system failures network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results leading to the unintentional disclosure of company partner customer or employee information or could damage our reputation a cyber attack involving our information or industrial control systems and related infrastructure or that of our business associates could negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways including but not limited to the following 

■ unauthorized access to seismic data reserves information strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and natural gas resources 

■ data corruption communication or systems interruption or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in delays and failure to reach the intended target or cause a drilling incident 

■ data corruption communication or systems interruption or operational disruptions of productionrelated infrastructure could result in a loss of production or accidental discharge 

■ a cyber attack on our chemical operations could result in a disruption of the manufacturing and marketing of our products or a potential environmental hazard 

■ a cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt our construction and development projects 

■ a cyber attack on thirdparty gathering pipeline processing terminal or other infrastructure systems could delay or prevent us from producing transporting processing and marketing our production 

■ a cyber attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities 

■ a cyber attack that halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feedstock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market 

■ a cyber attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption 

■ a cyber attack on our automated and surveillance systems could cause a loss in production and potential environmental hazards 

■ a deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of noncompliance which could then lead to regulatory fines or penalties and 

■ a cyber attack resulting in the loss or disclosure of or damage to our or any of our customer’s or supplier’s data or confidential information could harm our business by damaging our reputation subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability and requiring us to incur significant costs including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps 

although occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of a cyber attack that it believes are reasonable there can be no assurance that such cyber security measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches of its systems from occurring and if a breach occurs it may remain undetected for an extended period of time further occidental has no control over the comparable systems of the third parties with whom it does business while occidental has experienced cyber attacks in the past occidental has not suffered any material losses however if in the future occidental’s cyber security measures are compromised or prove insufficient the potential consequences to occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant as cyber attacks continue to evolve 





in magnitude and sophistication occidental may be required to expend additional resources in order to continue to enhance occidental’s cyber security measures and to investigate and remediate any digital and operational systems related infrastructure technologies and network security vulnerabilities which would increase our costs a system failure or data security breach or a series of such failures or breaches could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

occidental’s oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect occidental’s business 

producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors unless occidental conducts successful exploration or development activities acquires properties containing proved reserves or both proved reserves will generally decline and negatively impact our business the value of our securities and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace reserves that are depleted by production or replace our declining production with new production by successfully allocating annual capital to maintain our reserves and production base occidental expects infill development projects extensions discoveries and improved recovery to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors such as geology government regulations and permits the effectiveness of development plans and the ability to make the necessary capital investments or acquire capital are partially or fully outside management’s control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations 

occidental’s operations and financial results could be significantly negatively impacted by its offshore operations 

occidental is vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our operations and financial results occidental conducts offshore operations primarily in the gulf of mexico and its operations and financial results are vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore including conditions relating to the following 

■ hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions 

■ geological complexities and water depths associated with such operations 

■ limited number of partners available to participate in projects 

■ oilfield service costs and availability 

■ compliance with environmental safety and other laws and regulations 

■ terrorist attacks or piracy 

■ remediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills emissions or releases of hazardous materials 

■ failure of equipment or facilities and 

■ response capabilities for personnel equipment or environmental incidents 

in addition occidental conducts some of its exploration in deep waters greater than 1000 feet where operations support services and decommissioning activities are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters the deep waters in the gulf of mexico as well as international deepwater locations lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters as a result deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and the time that occidental can market its production thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations 

occidental’s operations in the gulf of mexico were negatively impacted by hurricane ida in 2021 which reduced production by approximately 25 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe associated with safely shutting in production evacuating and then restarting the platforms 

occidental’s indebtedness may make it more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in its business downgrades in occidental’s credit ratings or future increases in interest rates may negatively impact occidental’s cost of capital and ability to access capital markets 

occidental’s level of indebtedness could increase occidental’s vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions economic downturns and adverse developments in its business andor limit occidental’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and the industries in which it operates from time to time occidental has relied on access to capital markets for funding including in connection with the acquisition there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to occidental in the future on acceptable terms or at all occidental’s ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing will be subject to a number of factors including general economic and market conditions occidental’s performance investor sentiment and its ability to meet existing debt compliance requirements if occidental is unable to generate sufficient funds from its operations to satisfy its capital requirements including its existing debt obligations or to raise additional capital on acceptable terms occidental’s business could be 





adversely affected as of the date of this filing occidental’s longterm debt was rated bb by fitch ratings ba2 by moody’s investors service and bb by standard and poor’s any downgrade in the credit ratings of occidental could negatively impact its cost of and ability to access capital and to effectively execute aspects of its strategy and may require occidental to provide cash collateral letters of credit or other forms of security under certain contractual agreements which would increase occidental’s operating costs and reduce liquidity 

one of occidental’s subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wes a publicly traded master limited partnership which may involve potential legal liability 

one of occidental’s subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wes a publicly traded master limited partnership our general partner interest in wes may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of duties owed to wes including claims of conflict of interest any such claims could increase our costs and any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on occidental’s financial condition operating results or cash flows 

anadarko’s tronox settlement may not be deductible for income tax purposes occidental may be required to repay the tax refund anadarko received in 2016 related to the deduction of the tronox settlement payment which may have a material adverse effect on occidental’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

in april 2014 anadarko and kerrmcgee corporation and certain of its subsidiaries collectively kerrmcgee entered into a settlement agreement for 52 billion resolving among other things all claims that were or could have been asserted in connection with the may 2009 lawsuit filed by tronox against anadarko and kerrmcgee in the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york after the settlement became effective in january 2015 anadarko paid 52 billion and deducted this payment on its 2015 federal income tax return due to the deduction anadarko had a net operating loss carryback for 2015 which resulted in a tentative tax refund of 881 million in 2016 

the internal revenue service irs has audited anadarko’s tax position regarding the deductibility of the payment and in september 2018 issued a statutory notice of deficiency rejecting anadarko’s refund claim anadarko disagreed and filed a petition with the us tax court to dispute the disallowance in november 2018 the case was in the irs appeals process until the second quarter of 2020 however it has since been returned to the us tax court where a trial date has been set for july 2022 and occidental expects to continue pursuing resolution in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic 740’s guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2021 occidental has recorded no tax benefit on the tentative cash tax refund if the payment is ultimately determined not to be deductible occidental would be required to repay the tentative refund received plus interest totaling approximately 13 billion as of december 31 2021 which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and consolidated balance sheets occidental’s consolidated financial statements include an uncertain tax position for the approximate repayment of 1 billion 1 billion federal and 27 million in state taxes plus accrued interest of approximately 314 million this amount is not covered by insurance for additional information on income taxes see note 10  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

general 

occidental’s operations financial condition cash flows and levels of expenditures are highly dependent on oil prices and to a lesser extent ngl and natural gas prices the midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads and the prices it receives for its chemical products during 2021 as compared to 2020 the average annual price per barrel bbl of west texas intermediate wti crude increased to 6791 from 3940 and the average annual brent price per barrel increased to 7078 from 4321 while the worldwide economy continues to be impacted by the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic and emergence and spread of new variants of the virus demand for oil has returned to near prepandemic levels current uncertainty of whether oil supply will be able to sustain a continued supply response as well as geopolitical risks have resulted in a significant increase to benchmark oil prices in addition current oil prices could be negatively impacted by the emergence of new covid19 variants slow vaccine distribution in developing economies or the recurrence or tightening of travel restrictions and stayathome orders 

strategy 

occidental is focused on delivering a unique shareholder value proposition with its integrated portfolio of oil and gas chemicals and midstream and marketing assets and its commitment to implement carbon management and storage solutions and reduce ghg emissions occidental conducts its operations with a focus on sustainability health safety and environmental and social responsibility occidental aims to maximize shareholder returns through a combination of 

■ enhancing capital and operational efficiency to sustain 2021 production levels and free cash flow 

■ reducing financial leverage while maintaining a robust liquidity position 

■ returning additional capital to shareholders while continuing to reduce debt and improve occidental’s financial position and 

■ advancing technologies and business solutions to help drive a sustainable lowcarbon future 

operational excellence and capital efficiency 

occidentals operational priorities for 2021 were to sustain production inline with its 2020 fourth quarter rate by investing 29 billion in capital and maintaining a majority of the cost savings achieved in 2020 occidental adhered to its capital budget and exceeded its original 2021 production guidance by 27 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day mboed occidental set new operational records and efficiency benchmarks in the permian rockies gulf of mexico and oman additionally oxychem recorded its highest earnings in 30 years largely as a result of stronger realized pricing and margins across most product lines with improved demand with the increase in commodity prices and occidental’s focus on its cash costs and operational efficiencies occidental’s higher cash flow allowed it to reduce its leverage and improve its liquidity position 

debt and interest rate swaps 

occidental used its excess cash flow generated during 2021 coupled with divestiture proceeds to continue to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing its debt and other financial obligations in 2021 occidental reduced total borrowings at face value of over 67 billion and retired interest rate swaps with a notional value of 750 million the 2021 balance sheet improvement efforts have significantly reduced debt maturities in the near and medium terms which will allow occidental more operational flexibility and the ability to pay down additional debt in the future with a more opportunistic approach as of december 31 2021 occidental had debt maturities of approximately 101 million in 2022 465 million in 2023 and 17 billion in 2024 in january 2022 occidental paid off its last 2022 maturity for 101 million 

occidental’s 23 billion zero coupon senior notes due 2036 zero coupons can be put to occidental in october of each year in whole or in part for the then accreted value of the outstanding zero coupons the zero coupons can next be put to occidental in october 2022 which if put in whole would require a payment of approximately 11 billion at such date occidental currently has the intent and ability to meet this obligation including if necessary using amounts available under the revolving credit facility rcf should the put right be exercised 

the remaining interest rate swaps with a fair value of 428 million net of collateral as of december 31 2021 have mandatory termination dates in september 2022 and 2023 the interest rate swaps’ fair value and cash required to settle them on their termination dates will continue to fluctuate with changes in interest rates through the mandatory termination dates 

as of december 31 2021 all of occidental’s brentpriced sold calls and two way natural gas collars have expired see note 8  derivative s in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion 





debt ratings 

as of the date of this filing occidental’s longterm debt was rated bb by fitch ratings ba2 by moody’s investors service and bb by standard and poor’s in january 2022 standard and poor’s upgraded occidental’s credit rating to bb any downgrade in credit ratings could impact occidentals ability to access capital markets and increase its cost of capital occidental’s noninvestment grade debt rating may require occidental to provide financial assurance in the form of cash letters of credit surety bonds or other acceptable support under certain contractual arrangements 

as of the date of this filing occidental has provided required financial assurance through a combination of cash letters of credit and surety bonds occidental has not issued any letters of credit under the rcf or other committed facilities for additional information see risk factors in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

sustainability and environmental stewardship strategy 

in 2020 occidental was the first us oil and gas company to announce goals to achieve netzero ghg emissions for its total emissions inventory including use of sold products these goals include achieving netzero ghg emissions i from its operations and energy use before 2040 with an ambition to do so before 2035 and ii from the use of its sold products with an ambition to do so before 2050 in 2020 occidental also set various interim targets including 2025 carbon and methane intensity targets and occidental was also the first us oil and gas company to endorse the world bank’s initiative for zero routine flaring by 2030 in 2021 occidental made progress on these sustainability commitments and established additional interim targets toward its netzero goals to advance a lowcarbon future 

occidental seeks to meet its sustainability and environmental goals through its development and commercialization of technologies that lower both ghg emissions from industrial processes and existing atmospheric concentrations of co 2  occidental believes that carbon removal technologies including dac and ccus can with incentives necessary for their development and deployment provide essential co 2 reductions in the medium term while the world transitions to a lower carbon intensive economy occidental has undertaken the following actions among others toward advancing its lowcarbon strategy 

■ incorporated specific ghg emissions reduction targets in its rcf and receivables securitization facility which can impact its costs related to its borrowing facilities 

■ invested in a third party to develop a zeroemission natural gas generation demonstration facility and license the underlying technology 

■ initiated a front end engineering and design study on an industrial scale dac facility 

■ implemented multiple programs to reduce emissions and the routine flaring of gas 

■ delivered the world’s first cargo of carbonneutral oil in january 2021 

■ formed teams to specifically advance occidental’s environmental social and governance goals and associated accounting and report to executive management and 

■ provided technical advisory services to third parties regarding their ccus projects 

in 2022 olcv plans to invest approximately 300 million in the development and commercialization of new technologies and lowcarbon business models in addition occidental plans to invest approximately 83 million in emissions reduction capital projects at its existing oil and gas chemical and other midstream operations in 2022 such as retrofitting facilities to reduce co 2  methane and other air emissions the future costs associated with emissions reduction carbon removal and ccus to meet its longterm netzero ghg goals may be substantial and execution of its plans depends on securing financing occidental is pursuing multiple pathways to finance these projects including 

■ project financing with longterm carbon removal or ccus agreements 

■ identifying business opportunities with stakeholders in carbonintensive industries and 

■ occidental selffunding with excess cash flow 

liquidity 

occidental exited 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of 28 billion and total borrowings at face value of 285 billion occidental undertook the following actions to improve its liquidity position beyond the improvements provided by 2021’s strong cash flows 

■ maintained its 2021 capital budget of 29 billion while exceeding production guidance 

■ maintained the majority of cost savings achieved in prior years 

■ completed its largescale asset divestiture program 

■ amended and extended the rcf to june 2025 with a fully committed borrowing capacity of 40 billion the amended facility is now a secured overnight financing rate sofr priced sustainability linked loan with no material change to existing covenants and 

■ amended and extended the receivables securitization facility to december 2024 with a borrowing capacity as of the date of this filing of 400 million the amended facility is now a sofrpriced sustainability linked loan 





in the current commodity price environment occidental intends to continue strengthening its financial position while returning additional cash to shareholders through an increase in the common dividend and a reactivated share repurchase program occidental expects to fund its return of capital to shareholders as well as its operational and capital requirements with cash flows from operations occidental will continue to evaluate the economic environment as well as the commodity price environment and may make further adjustments to its future levels of capital expenditures and operating and corporate costs however lower oil and gas prices as a result of the covid19 pandemic or reduced demand may result in the short or longterm reduction of occidental’s capital expenditures and production profile occidental believes the longterm sustainability of the increased dividend rate even in a lower oil and gas price environment will be enhanced by continued deleveraging and the reactivated share repurchase program 

key performance indicators 

occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success against key performance indicators that drive total stockholder return in addition to efficient capital allocation and deployment discussed below in the section titled oil and gas segment  business strategy  occidental believes the following are its most significant performance indicators 

safety 

■ injury incidence rate iir and days away restricted transfer dart rate  occidental’s combined employee and contractor iir is determined by multiplying the total number of occupational safety and health administration osha recordable injuries and illnesses by 200000 and dividing that result by the total number of hours worked by all employees and contractors the dart rate is calculated in the same manner as iir but uses the number of incidents that resulted in days away from work job transfer or restricted job duties instead of the number of recordable injuries or illnesses 

operational 

■ total spend per barrel  in 2022 occidental will continue to focus on controlling total costs from a perbarrel perspective total spend per barrel is the sum of capital spending general and administrative expenses other operating and nonoperating expenses and oil and gas lease operating costs divided by global oil ngl and natural gas sales volumes 

■ daily production  occidental seeks to maintain 2021 production levels 

financial 

■ cash returns on capital employed croce  croce is calculated as i the cash flows from operating activities before changes in working capital plus distributions from wes classified as investing cash flows divided by ii the average of the opening and closing balances of total equity plus total debt 

■ reduce financial leverage 

sustainability and environmental 

■ specific emissions reduction emissions intensity and zero routine flaring targets to advance our goal of netzero operational and energy use emissions before 2040 with an ambition to achieve before 2035 

■ milestones in specific carbon removal and ccus projects that advance our netzero total emissions inventory including use of sold products with an ambition to achieve before 2050 

■ water recycling targets to reduce the use of fresh water resources and the disposal of surplus produced water 

■ facilitate deployment of carbon removal ccus and other solutions to advance total carbon impact past 2050 

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

occidental continues to focus on protecting the health and safety of its employees and contractors during the covid19 pandemic new workplace safety protocols and procedures were implemented by occidental for its offices and work sites in response to help mitigate the spread of covid19 and any related variants occidental has not incurred material costs or significant disruptions to its daytoday operations related to the covid19 pandemic to date however the extent to which the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect occidentals business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which remain uncertain 







business strategy 

occidental’s oil and gas segment focuses on longterm value creation and leadership in sustainability health safety and the environment in each core operating area occidental’s operations benefit from scale technical expertise decades of highmargin inventory environmental and safety leadership and commercial and governmental collaboration these attributes allow occidental to bring additional production quickly to market extend the life of older fields at lower costs and provide lowcost returnsdriven growth opportunities with advanced technology 

with the completion of the acquisition occidental became one of the largest us producers of liquids which includes oil and ngl allowing occidental to maximize cash margins on a bbl basis since the acquisition occidental initially focused on its divestiture program to pay down nearterm debt maturities however the advantages that occidental’s portfolio provides coupled with unmatched subsurface characterization ability and the proven ability to execute position occidental for fullcycle success in the years ahead the oil and gas segment has realized synergies to deliver lower breakeven costs and generate excess free cash flow and with the late 2021 sale of the ghana assets occidental has completed its large scale asset divestiture program 

occidental’s assets are strategically positioned to provide a future portfolio of projects that are flexible and have a mix of shortcycle and midcycle investment paybacks together with occidental’s technical capabilities the oil and gas segment strives to achieve low development and operating costs to maximize fullcycle value of the assets 

the oil and gas business implements occidental’s strategy primarily by 

■ operating and developing areas where reserves are known to exist and optimizing capital intensity in core areas primarily in the permian basin dj basin gulf of mexico uae oman and algeria 

■ maintaining a disciplined and prudent approach to capital expenditures with a focus on highreturn shortcycle cashflowgenerating opportunities and an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing occidental’s existing positions 

■ focusing occidental’s subsurface characterization and technical activities on unconventional opportunities primarily in the permian basin 

■ using eor techniques such as co 2  water and steam floods in mature fields and 

■ focusing on costreduction efficiencies and innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions 

in 2021 oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately 24 billion and primarily focused on occidental’s assets in the permian basin dj basin gulf of mexico and oman 

oil and gas price environment 

oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s financial performance the following table presents the average daily wti and brent prices for oil and new york mercantile exchange nymex natural gas prices for 2021 and 2020 



the following table presents occidental’s average realized prices for continuing operations as a percentage of wti brent and nymex for 2021 and 2020 

  

prices and differentials can vary significantly even on a shortterm basis making it difficult to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty 





domestic interests 

business review 

occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both occidental’s domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to 10 years which is extended through the end of production once it commences occidental has leasehold and mineral interests in 95 million net acres of which approximately 52 is leased 24 is owned subsurface mineral rights and 24 is owned land with mineral rights

the permian basin extends throughout west texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states accounting for more than 41 of total united states oil production in 2021 overall in 2021 occidental’s share of production in the permian basin was approximately 487 mboed 

occidental manages its permian basin operations through two business units permian resources which includes unconventional opportunities and permian eor which utilizes eor techniques such as co 2 floods and waterfloods occidental has a leading position in the permian basin producing approximately 9 of total oil in the basin throughout 2021 by exploiting the natural synergies between permian resources and permian eor occidental is able to deliver unique short and longterm advantages efficiencies and expertise across its permian basin operations 

permian resources unconventional oil development projects provide very shortcycle investment payback averaging less than two years these investments contribute cash flow while increasing longterm value and sustainability through higher return on capital employed occidental’s oil and gas operations in permian resources include approximately 15 million net acres in 2021 well design processes technologies and logistics improvements drove increased operational efficiencies which helped lower the overall well cost while improving recovery overall in 2021 permian resources produced from approximately 6000 gross wells and added 222 mmboe to occidental’s proved reserves through development and extensions of proved area 

the permian basin’s concentration of large conventional reservoirs favorable co 2 flooding performance and the expansive co 2 transportation and processing infrastructure has resulted in decades of highvalue enhanced oil production with 35 active co 2 floods and over 50 years of experience occidental is the industry leader in permian basin co 2 flooding which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10 to 25 technology improvements such as the recent trend toward vertical expansion of the co 2 flooded interval into residual oil zone targets continue to yield more recovery from existing projects and permian eor produced from approximately 14100 gross wells in 2021 

significant opportunities also remain to gain additional recovery by expanding occidental’s existing co 2 projects into new portions of reservoirs that have only been waterflooded permian eor has a large inventory of future co 2 projects 





which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated depending on market conditions in addition olcv continues making progress towards supplying anthropogenic co 2 for the purpose of ccus in occidental’s permian eor operations 

in 2021 occidental spent approximately 11 billion of capital in the permian basin of which approximately 93 was spent on permian resources assets also in 2021 occidental divested of certain nonstrategic assets in the permian resources business unit as well as acquired additional working interests in certain assets in our permian eor business unit in 2022 occidental expects to allocate approximately 17 billion to 19 billion or almost half of its worldwide capital budget to the permian basin 

rockies and other domestic 

occidental was colorado’s top oil and gas producer in 2021 with interests in approximately 600000 net acres and net production of approximately 302 mboed in 2021 in our rockies and other domestic locations production in colorado is derived from 2200 operated vertical wells and 2300 operated horizontal wells primarily focused in 400000 net acres in the niobrara and codell formations the dj basin provides competitive economics low breakeven costs and free cash flow generation through occidental’s contiguous acreage position and royalty uplift 

in the dj basin horizontal drilling results in the field continue to be strong with improved operational efficiencies in drilling and completions in 2021 occidental drilled 72 operated horizontal wells and completed 163 operated horizontal wells also in 2021 occidental divested of certain nonoperated assets in the dj basin in 2022 occidental plans to deploy approximately 04 billion in total net capital spending in the rockies and other domestic 

in january 2021 the cogcc adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements or “setbacks” on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures other state agencies including the colorado department of public health and environment and the colorado air quality control commission have also updated their regulations regarding oil and gas operations as of december 31 2021 occidental is fully permitted or has submitted permit applications to applicable regulatory agencies for all planned 2022 drilling and completions activity in the dj basin as of yearend 2021 occidental had not been denied any permits and received its first oil  gas development plan permit approval under the new cogcc regulations in the fourth quarter of 2021 occidental has a dedicated multidisciplinary stakeholder relations team that conducts regulatory and community outreach with respect to its permit applications and operations in colorado occidental continues to have development optionality by flexing resources between the dj basin and other high rateofreturn projects in the permian or powder river basin occidental’s focus for 2022 in colorado is continuing to proactively implement colorado’s new and updated regulatory processes and build operational inventory 

occidental has gained efficiencies in the permitting process and will continue to look for additional opportunities to do so as discussed above occidental does not anticipate significant nearterm changes to our development program in the dj basin based on these regulations however if occidental is unable to obtain new drilling permits to develop a significant portion of the company’s undeveloped acreage in the dj basin the company’s dj basin assets may be subject to testing for impairment and if deemed to be impaired such impairment could be material to our financial statements 

occidental holds approximately 50 million net acres in other domestic locations which includes the powder river basin north dj basin and wyoming 

offshore domestic assets 

gulf of mexico 

occidental is the fourthlargest oil and gas producer in the deepwater gulf of mexico operating 10 strategically located deepwater floating platforms producing from 17 active fields while owning a working interest in 180 blocks – one of the largest portfolios in the gulf of mexico occidental further operates marine shorebases in galveston texas and port fourchon louisiana as well as two helicopter bases in louisiana that are configured to support the western and eastern gulf operations which are located across the 600mile platform spread as well as providing back up and redundancy to each other a central supply chain base with a training center is located in broussard louisiana and the operations are supported and managed with engineering and technical staff from the woodlands texas offices 

in 2021 occidental increased net production to 144 mboed from approximately 78 gross wells investing over 300 million in capital primarily directed towards drilling activity in its horn mountain west subsea development lucius and holstein facilities using one floating drill ship and one platform rig occidental also progressed and accelerated key infrastructure facility projects for horn mountain west caesartonga subsea expansion as well as initiating a major subseapumping project supporting the k2 complex 

operational excellence and efficiency was a prime initiative in 2021 for both drilling and well performance including the implementation of several stimulations and artificial lift projects together with optimum sequencing of platform turnarounds to reduce both planned and unplanned downtime for a third consecutive year hazard and operability studies of all 10 platforms were completed in 2021 and implementation of the resulting risk reduction projects was commenced during 2021 all necessary regulatory permits for new wells and for existing operations were obtained timely 





the following table shows areas of continuing development in the gulf of mexico along with the corresponding working interest in those areas 



in 2022 occidental expects to allocate approximately 05 billion in capital expenditures to continue to leverage its strategically advantaged infrastructure across the gulf of mexico to deliver highmargin production while seeking expansion and exploration opportunities occidental plans to conduct production adding activities with one floating drillship onetotwo platform rigs with several other well service vessels horn mountain west first production is scheduled for summer 2022 with caesartonga subsea expansion ready for first production before spring 2023 several seismic acquisition programs are planned in 2022 to delineate and derisk development opportunities as well as generate new opportunities that support the strategy of continued longterm production from the gulf of mexico 

international interests 

business review 

occidental conducts its ongoing international operations in two subregions the middle east and north africa its activities include oil ngl and natural gas production through direct workinginterests production sharing agreements psa and production sharing contracts psc under the pscs occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain development and production costs and an additional share for profit these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher approximately 05 billion of occidental’s worldwide capital budget is expected to be allocated to its international operations in 2022

ghana  discontinued operations 

in october 2021 occidental completed the sale of its ghana assets prior to the divestiture ghana operations included production and development activities located offshore in the west cape three point block and the deepwater tano block occidental’s net share of production in 2021 was 16 mboed 





proved reserves 

proved oil ngl and natural gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements oil ngl and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity quality and transportation costs 

the following table shows the 2021 2020 and 2019 calculated firstdayofthemonth average prices for both wti and brent oil prices as well as the henry hub gas prices measured in million british thermal units mmbtu 



a mt belvieu pricing was added as an ngl benchmark beginning in 2020 prior to 2020 wti oil was used as a benchmark for ngl 

occidental had proved reserves from continuing operations at yearend 2021 of 3512 mmboe compared to the yearend 2020 amount of 2911 mmboe proved developed reserves represented approximately 75 and 78 of occidental’s total proved reserves at yearend 2021 and 2020 respectively the following table shows the breakout of occidental’s proved reserves from continuing operations by commodity as a percentage of total proved reserves 



occidental does not have any reserves from nontraditional sources for further information regarding occidental’s proved reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information section in item 8 of this form 10k 

changes in proved reserves 

occidental’s total proved reserves from continuing operations increased 601 mmboe in 2021 which was primarily driven by price and other revisions of 829 mmboe and extensions and discoveries of 145 mmboe these increases were partially offset by production of 426 mmboe and asset divestitures of 11 mmboe changes in reserves were as follows 



occidental’s ability to add reserves other than through purchases depends on the success of infill development extension discovery and improved recovery projects each of which depends on reservoir characteristics technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices as well as capital and operating costs many of these factors are outside management’s control and may negatively or positively affect occidental’s reserves 

revisions of previous estimates 

revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic production decline or operating performance data in addition product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental for example lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves particularly for domestic properties because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations offsetting this effect lower prices increase occidental’s share of proved reserves under pscs because more oil is required to recover costs conversely when prices rise occidental’s share of proved reserves decreases for pscs and economically 





recoverable reserves may increase for other operations reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data 

in 2021 occidental’s revisions of previous estimates of proved reserves were positive 829 mmboe of which approximately 421 mmboe were positive price revisions the positive price revisions were primarily associated with the permian basin 380 mmboe and the dj basin 51 mmboe which were partially offset by negative price revisions of 35 mmboe on international pscs 

an additional 208 mmboe of positive revisions were related to additions associated with infill development projects primarily in the permian basin 103 mmboe and the dj basin 90 mmboe 

further positive revisions of 101 mmboe were associated with updates based on reservoir performance 

the remaining revisions were associated with various other cost related revisions 57 mmboe and management changes in development plans primarily due to higher average commodity prices compared to the prior year 42 mmboe 

improved recovery 

in 2021 occidental added proved reserves of 20 mmboe related to improved recovery primarily due to secondary and tertiary projects mainly in certain international assets which accounted for approximately twothirds of the reserve additions these properties comprise conventional projects which are characterized by the deployment of eor development methods largely employing application of co 2 flood waterflood or steam flood these types of conventional eor development methods can be applied through existing wells though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells the use of either co 2 or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation the evaluation of engineering data availability and cost of either co 2 or steam and other economic factors both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells 

extensions and discoveries 

occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs in 2021 extensions and discoveries added 145 mmboe primarily related to the recognition of proved reserves in the permian basin 120 mmboe and gulf of mexico 10 mmboe 

purchases of proved reserves 

in 2021 occidental purchased proved reserves of 44 mmboe primarily consisting of proved reserves in the permian eor 

sales of proved reserves 

in 2021 occidental sold 11 mmboe in proved reserves primarily related to the divestitures of certain nonstrategic assets in the permian basin 

proved undeveloped reserves 

occidental had pud reserves at yearend 2021 of 865 mmboe compared to the yearend 2020 amount of 645 mmboe 

changes in pud reserves were as follows 



revisions of previous estimates were a positive 280 mmboe approximately 203 mmboe of the positive revisions were related to additions associated with infill development projects primarily in the permian basin 99 mmboe and the dj basin 90 mmboe additionally the revisions included positive price revisions of 50 mmboe the positive price revisions were primarily associated with the permian basin 48 mmboe and the dj basin 8 mmboe further 38 mmboe of positive revisions were related to management changes in development plans the remaining revisions were associated with various updates based on reservoir performance 

extensions and discoveries added 60 mmboe primarily related to the recognition of proved reserves in the permian basin 45 mmboe and gulf of mexico 10 mmboe total improved recovery additions of 10 mmboe were primarily the result 





of secondary and tertiary projects in international assets 9 mmboe the 2021 additions to pud reserves were offset by transfers to proved developed reserves transfers to proved developed reserves were a total of 136 mmboe the transfers were primarily associated with the dj basin 70 mmboe the permian basin 41 mmboe and gulf of mexico 18 mmboe 

pud reserves are supported by a fiveyear detailed fieldlevel development plan which includes the timing location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled only pud reserves which are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan a portion of the pud reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved longterm development projects 

in 2021 occidental incurred approximately 06 billion to convert pud reserves to proved developed reserves and in 2021 occidental converted approximately 15 of its pud reserves to proved developed when adjusted for revisions and sales as of december 31 2021 occidental had 865 mmboe of pud reserves of which 60 were associated with domestic onshore 8 with gulf of mexico and 32 with international assets occidental’s most active development areas are located in the permian basin which represented 45 of the pud reserves as of december 31 2021 almost half of occidental’s 2022 capital program of 39 billion to 43 billion is allocated to the development program in the permian basin overall occidental plans to spend approximately 30 billion over the next five years to develop its pud reserves in the permian basin 

as of december 31 2021 occidental had 192 mmboe of pre2017 pud reserves that remained undeveloped these pud reserves relate to approved longterm development plans 187 mmboe of which are associated with international development projects with physical limitations in existing gas processing capacity occidental remains committed to these projects and continues to actively progress the development of these volumes in addition to the above occidental has 112 mmboe of pud reserves that are scheduled to be developed more than five years from their initial date of booking these pud reserves are primarily related to approved longterm development plans with physical limitations in existing gas processing capacity 63 mmboe of which are associated with other permian eor projects and 38 mmboe associated with international development projects 

reserves evaluation and review process 

occidental’s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of december 31 2021 were made by occidental’s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management the estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by occidental to develop the reserves this process involves reservoir engineers geoscientists planning engineers and financial analysts as part of the proved reserves estimation process all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates operating costs and capital expenditures price differentials between benchmark prices the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods including estimates from decline curve analysis type curve analysis material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance these reliable fieldtested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities 

net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor 

net pud reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion pud reserves are supported by a fiveyear detailed fieldlevel development plan which includes the timing location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled the development plan is reviewed and approved annually by senior management and technical personnel annually a detailed review is performed by occidental’s worldwide reserves group and its technical personnel on a leasebylease basis to assess whether pud reserves are being converted on a timely basis within five years from the initial disclosure date any leases not showing timely transfers from pud reserves to proved developed reserves are reviewed by senior management to determine if the remaining reserves will be developed in a timely manner and have sufficient capital committed in the development plan only pud reserves that are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan a portion of the pud reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved longterm development plans

occidental has a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee consisting of senior corporate officers to review and approve occidental’s oil and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidental’s board of directors during the year since 2003 occidental has retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum engineering consultants to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes for additional reserves information see supplemental oil and gas information under item 8 of this form 10k 

in 2021 ryder scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of december 31 2021 in accordance with sec regulatory standards ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of occidental’s 2021 yearend total proved reserves portfolio in 2021 ryder scott reviewed approximately 36 of occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves since being engaged in 2003 ryder scott has reviewed the specific application of occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 91 of occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves 

management retained ryder scott to provide objective thirdparty input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by occidental occidental has filed ryder scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this form 10k 

based on its reviews including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current sec regulations 

industry outlook 

the oil and gas exploration and production industry is highly competitive is subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions and operations are highly dependent on oil prices and to a lesser extent ngl and natural gas prices oil prices increased significantly in 2021 during 2021 as compared to 2020 the average annual bbl of wti crude increased to 6791 from 3940 and the average annual brent price per barrel increased to 7078 from 4321 

oil prices will continue to be affected by i global supply and demand which are generally a function of global economic conditions inventory levels production or supply chain disruptions technological advances regional market conditions and the actions of opec other significant producers and governments ii transportation capacity infrastructure constraints and costs in producing areas iii currency exchange rates and inflation rates and iv the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions 

ngl prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock in addition infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region 

domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals as well as government regulations global lng demand and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas 

we expect that oil prices in the nearterm will continue to be influenced by the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic and its resulting impact on oil and gas supply and demand 

these and other factors make it difficult to predict the future direction of oil ngl and domestic gas prices reliably for purposes of the current capital plan occidental will continue to focus on allocating capital to its highestreturn assets with the flexibility to adjust based on fluctuations in commodity prices international gas prices are generally fixed under longterm contracts occidental continues to adjust capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital 

the timing process and ultimate cost to transition to a lower carbon intensive economy remains largely unknown various industry forecasts indicate a growing demand for hydrocarbons for the remainder of the current decade occidental believes its operational flexibility regarding its mix of shortcycle and midcycle projects and its knowledge and experience in co 2 separation transportation use recycling and storage means that its oil and gas segment is well positioned to support occidental’s transition to net zero as well as create opportunities in a lowcarbon future

the marketing group markets substantially all of occidental’s oil ngl and natural gas production and optimizes its transportation and storage capacity occidental’s thirdparty marketing activities focus on purchasing oil ngl and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets these purchases allow occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets in 2021 compared to the prior year marketing results were favorable due to the rising crude oil price environment and its impact on export sales 

delivery and transportation commitments 

occidental has made longterm commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil ngl and natural gas the total amount contracted to be delivered is approximately 92 mmbbl of oil through 2025 731 mmbbl of ngl through 2029 and 764 bcf of gas through 2029 the price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product 

occidental has pipeline takeorpay capacity of approximately 800 thousand barrels per day mbbld to the gulf coast leased storage capacity of approximately 10 mmbbl and capacity at the ingleside crude terminal of approximately 525 mbbld 

pipeline 

occidental’s pipeline business mainly consists of its 245 ownership interest in del del owns and operates a 230milelong 48inchdiameter natural gas pipeline dolphin pipeline which transports dry natural gas from qatar to the uae and oman the dolphin pipeline has capacity to transport up to 32 bcfd and currently transports approximately 20 bcfd and up to 22 bcfd in the summer months 

gas processing gathering and co 2 

occidental processes its and thirdparty domestic wet gas to extract ngl and other gas byproducts including co 2 and delivers dry gas to pipelines margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for ngl 

as of december 31 2021 occidental owned all of the 22 nonvoting general partner interest and 497 of the limited partner units in wes on a combined basis with its 2 nonvoting limited partner interest in western midstream operating lp wes operating occidentals total effective economic interest in wes and its subsidiaries was 518 see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form

occidental’s 40 participating interest in al hosn gas also includes sour gas processing facilities that are designed to process 128 bcfd of natural gas and separate it into salable gas condensate ngl and sulfur in 2021 the project produced 640 mmcfd of natural gas 100 mbbld of ngl and condensate and 11700 tonsd of sulfur of which occidental’s net share was 256 mmcfd of natural gas 40 mbbld of ngl and condensate and 4700 tonsd of sulfur  

in 2021 compared to the prior year gas processing gathering and co 2 results increased primarily due to higher sulfur and ngl prices 

power generation facilities 

earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties 

lowcarbon ventures 

olcv was formed to execute on occidental’s vision to reduce global emissions and provide a more sustainable future through the development of lowcarbon energy and products olcv capitalizes on occidental’s extensive experience in utilizing co 2 in its development of ccus projects and providing services to third parties to facilitate the implementation of their ccus projects moreover olcv is fostering new technologies including dac and lowcarbon power sources and business models with the potential to position occidental as a leader in the production of lowcarbon oil and products 

occidental has developed standards and protocols recognized by the epa for monitoring reporting and verifying the amount safety and permanence of co 2 stored through secure geologic sequestration occidental holds the nation’s first two epaapproved monitoring reporting and verification mrv plans for geologic sequestration through eor production and obtained a third mrv plan in 2021 

olcv is currently conducting frontend engineering design work and feasibility studies on a number of projects to capture and sequester co 2  either from the atmosphere or from industrial point sources in 2022 olcv plans to invest approximately 300 million to pursue various projects 

the profitability of sequestration projects is dependent upon the costs of developing building and operating sequestration infrastructure demand for sequestration services from emitters and the availability of certain tax attributes and credits generated from the capture and storage of co 2  

industry outlook 

midstream and marketing segment results can experience volatility depending on the midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads commodity price changes and demand impacting export sales to a lesser extent declines in commodity prices including ngl and sulfur prices reduce the results for the gas processing business 

at the end of 2021 the us experienced economywide cost increases which could increase the cost of sequestration projects occidental saw increased interest from third parties in providing sequestration services during the year additionally grants credits and other taxadvantaged lowcarbon attributes continue to be actively discussed at both state and federal levels these trends are expected to continue which occidental believes will enhance the economics of sequestration projects 







segment results of operations 

segment earnings exclude income taxes interest income interest expense environmental remediation expenses unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations but include gains and losses from divestitures of segment assets and income from the segments’ equity investments seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in occidental’s consolidated quarterly earnings during the year

a 2020 and 2019 average realized prices have been adjusted to reflect the exclusion of colombia which was sold in 2020 

domestic oil and gas results excluding significant items affecting comparability increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher realized oil ngl and natural gas prices partially offset by higher dda rates and overall lower oil volumes primarily in the permian basin and dj basin 

international oil and gas results excluding significant items affecting comparability increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher oil prices partially offset by lower oil volumes 

production

average daily production volumes from ongoing operations decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to maintaining capital expenditures at a level to sustain production at the rate occidental exited 2020 

lease operating expense 

the following table sets forth the average lease operating expense per boe from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2021 



average lease operating expense per boe increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily as a result of higher maintenance support and workover costs in the gulf of mexico including additional costs associated with platforms reaching the end of their useful life as well as higher energy and purchase injectant costs in the permian partially offset by continued operational efficiencies which decreased down hole maintenance and workover and support costs in the permian

total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance were 35 billion and 43 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets net of any allowances through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences the total deferred tax liabilities were 105 billion and 114 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease in net deferred tax liability in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the impact of lower capital spending and domestic asset impairments for which occidental does not receive an immediate tax benefit partially offset by the utilization of net operating losses and other tax attributes 

legal entity reorganization 

in order to align occidental’s legal entity structure with the nature of its business activities after completing the acquisition of anadarko and subsequent large scale postacquisition divestiture program management has undertaken a legal entity reorganization that is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022 

as a result of this legal entity reorganization management will make an adjustment to the tax basis in a portion of its operating assets thus reducing occidental’s deferred tax liabilities accordingly in the first quarter of 2022 occidental will record a onetime noncash tax benefit that is currently estimated not to exceed 26 billion in connection with this reorganization the timing of any reduction in occidental’s future cash taxes as a result of this legal entity reorganization will be dependent on a number of factors including prevailing commodity prices capital activity level and production mix occidental will complete its review of its tax basis calculations fair value assessments and other information and will finalize the adjustment to its deferred tax liabilities during the first quarter of 2022 

worldwide effective tax rate 

the following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations 







in 2021 occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate was 25 which was higher than the us statutory rate of 21 due to higher tax rates in the foreign jurisdictions in which occidental operates partially offset by the tax impact of business credits state tax revaluations and other domestic tax benefits 

in 2020 occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate was 14 which was largely a result of the impairment of the wes goodwill and certain international assets for which occidental received no tax benefit and highertaxed international operations which generally caused occidental’s tax rate to vary significantly from the us corporate tax rate

cash flow analysis 

cash provided by operating activities 



cash provided by operating activities increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher commodity prices especially for oil as average wti and brent prices increased by 72 and 64 respectively the chemical segment also generated substantial operating cash flows largely due to higher demand for most chemical products including caustic soda and pvc and higher pricing relative to 2020 the overall increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by an increase in working capital related to receivables which increased largely as a result of higher commodity prices 

cash used by investing activities 



cash flows used by investing activities increased by 434 million in 2021 compared to 2020 in 2020 occidental reduced capital spending in response to the covid19 pandemic and targeted its capital spend in 2021 to maintain q4 production and other maintenance capital for operating segments additionally occidental completed its major divestiture plans reducing proceeds from asset sales year over year see note 5  acquisitions divestitures and other transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for a listing of assets and equity investments sold in 2021 2020 and 2019 in addition occidental received a 450 million return of investment from del which is being presented in other investing activities net and acquired an additional working interests in certain assets in the permian basin and the gulf of mexico for approximately 360 million

legal matters 

occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property damage or other losses punitive damages civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar federal state local and international environmental laws these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties and injunctive relief usually occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies further some lawsuits claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction 

in accordance with applicable accounting guidance occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated reserves for matters other than for environmental remediation and the arbitration award disclosed below that satisfy this criteria as of december 31 2021 and 2020 were not material to occidental’s consolidated balance sheets 

in 2016 occidental received payments from the republic of ecuador of approximately 10 billion pursuant to a november 2015 arbitration award for ecuador’s 2006 expropriation of occidental’s participation contract for block 15 the awarded amount represented a recovery of 60 of the value of block 15 in 2017 andes petroleum ecuador ltd andes filed a demand for arbitration claiming it is entitled to a 40 share of the judgment amount obtained by occidental occidental contends that andes is not entitled to any of the amounts paid under the 2015 arbitration award because occidental’s recovery was limited to occidental’s own 60 economic interest in the block on march 26 2021 the arbitration tribunal issued an award in favor of andes and against occidental exploration and production company oepc in the amount of 391 million plus interest in june 2021 oepc filed a motion to vacate the award due to concerns regarding the validity of the award in addition oepc has made a demand for significant additional claims not addressed by the arbitration tribunal that oepc has against andes relating to andes 40 share of costs liabilities losses and expenses due under the farmout agreement and joint operating agreement to which andes and oepc are parties in december 2021 the us district court southern district of new york confirmed the arbitration award plus prejudgment interest in the aggregate amount of 558 million oepc has appealed the judgement 

in august 2019 sanchez energy corporation and certain of its affiliates sanchez filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code sanchez is a party to agreements with anadarko as a result of its 2017 purchase of anadarkos eagle ford shale assets sanchez attempted to reject some of the agreements related to the purchase of anadarko’s eagle ford shale assets the bankruptcy litigation if sanchez was permitted to reject certain of those agreements then anadarko may owe deficiency payments to various third parties in december 2021 occidental and certain of its affiliates entered into an agreement to resolve the bankruptcy litigation occidental recorded a contingency reserve as of september 30 2021 associated with the settlement 

if unfavorable outcomes of these matters were to occur future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected occidental’s estimates are based on information known about the legal matters and its experience in contesting litigating and settling similar matters occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available 

tax matters 

during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and international tax jurisdictions tax years through 2017 for us federal income tax purposes have been audited by the irs pursuant to its compliance assurance program and subsequent taxable years are currently under review tax years through 2012 have been audited for state income tax purposes significant audit matters in international jurisdictions have been resolved through 2010 during the course of tax audits disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law 

for anadarko its taxable years through 2014 and tax year 2016 for us federal tax purposes have been audited by the irs tax years through 2008 have been audited for state income tax purposes there is one outstanding significant tax matter in an international jurisdiction related to a discontinued operation as stated above during the course of tax audits disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law 

other than the matter discussed below occidental believes that the resolution of these outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

anadarko received an 881 million tentative refund in 2016 related to its 52 billion tronox adversary proceeding settlement payment in 2015 in september 2018 anadarko received a statutory notice of deficiency from the irs disallowing the net operating loss carryback and rejecting anadarko’s refund claim as a result anadarko filed a petition with the us tax court to dispute the disallowances in november 2018 the case was in the irs appeals process until the second 





quarter of 2020 however it has since been returned to the us tax court where a trial date has been set for july 2022 and occidental expects to continue pursuing resolution 

in accordance with asc 740’s guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions occidental has recorded no tax benefit on the tentative cash tax refund of 881 million as a result should occidental not ultimately prevail on the issue there would be no additional tax expense recorded relative to this position for financial statement purposes other than future interest however in that event occidental would be required to repay approximately 1 billion in federal taxes 27 million in state taxes and accrued interest of 314 million a liability for this amount plus interest is included in deferred credits and other liabilitiesother 

indemnities to third parties 

occidental its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2021 occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 



occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal state local and international laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality the laws that require or address environmental remediation including cercla and similar federal state local and international laws may apply retroactively and regardless of fault the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites occidental or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating closed and thirdparty sites remedial activities may include one or more of the following investigation involving sampling modeling risk assessment or monitoring cleanup measures including removal treatment or disposal or operation and maintenance of remedial systems the environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties injunctive relief and government oversight costs

as of december 31 2021 occidental’s environmental liabilities exceeded 10 million each at 20 of the 165 sites described above and 96 of the sites had liabilities from 0 to 1 million each as of december 31 2021 two sites — the maxus energy corporation maxusindemnified diamond alkali superfund site and a landfill in western new york — accounted for 96 of its liabilities associated with npl sites 14 of the 30 npl sites are indemnified by maxus 

five of the 69 thirdparty sites — a maxusindemnified chrome site in new jersey a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee a former oil field and a landfill in california and an active refinery in louisiana where occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities — accounted for 75 of occidental’s liabilities associated with these sites nine of the 69 thirdparty sites are indemnified by maxus 

four sites — oil and gas operations in colorado and chemical plants in kansas louisiana and texas — accounted for 69 of the liabilities associated with the occidentaloperated sites ten other sites — a landfill in western new york a 





former refinery in oklahoma former chemical plants in california delaware michigan new york ohio tennessee and washington and a closed coal mine in pennsylvania — accounted for 75 of the liabilities associated with closed or nonoperated occidental sites 

environmental remediation liabilities vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or divestitures identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation occidental recorded environmental remediation expenses of 28 million 36 million and 112 million for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively environmental remediation expenses primarily relate to changes to existing conditions from past operations based on current estimates occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40 of the yearend remediation balance over the next three to four years with the remainder over the subsequent 10 or more years occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those amounts currently recorded for environmental remediation for all of its environmental sites could be up to 13 billion 

maxus environmental sites 

when occidental acquired diamond shamrock chemicals company dscc in 1986 maxus a subsidiary of ypf sa agreed to indemnify occidental for a number of environmental sites including the diamond alkali superfund site site along a portion of the passaic river on june 17 2016 maxus and several affiliated companies filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal district court in the state of delaware prior to filing for bankruptcy maxus defended and indemnified occidental in connection with cleanup and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity including the site 

in march 2016 the epa issued a record of decision rod specifying remedial actions required for the lower 83 miles of the lower passaic river the rod does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river or newark bay during the third quarter of 2016 and following maxus’s bankruptcy filing occidental and the epa entered into an administrative order on consent aoc to complete the design of the proposed cleanup plan outlined in the rod with an estimated cost of 165 million the epa announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties 

occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and remediation called for in the aoc and the rod as well as for certain other maxusindemnified sites occidentals accrued estimated environmental reserve does not consider any recoveries for indemnified costs occidental’s ultimate share of this liability may be higher or lower than the reserved amount and is subject to final design plans and the resolution of occidentals allocable share with other potentially responsible parties occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the aoc and the rod and to perform remediation at other maxusindemnified sites in light of the maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties in june 2018 occidental filed a complaint under cercla in federal district court in the state of new jersey against numerous potentially responsible parties for reimbursement of amounts incurred or to be incurred to comply with the aoc and the rod or to perform other remediation activities at the site 

in september 2021 the epa issued a rod with an estimated cost of 441 million for an interim remedy plan for the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river at this time occidental’s role or responsibilities under this rod and those of other potentially responsible parties have not been determined with the epa discussions between occidental and the epa are ongoing about this rod 

in june 2017 the court overseeing the maxus bankruptcy approved a plan of liquidation plan to liquidate maxus and create a trust to pursue claims against current and former parents ypf and each of its respective subsidiaries and affiliates ypf and repsol sa and each of its respective subsidiaries and affiliates repsol as well as others to satisfy claims by occidental and other creditors for past and future cleanup and other costs in july 2017 the courtapproved plan became final and the trust became effective the trust is pursuing claims against ypf repsol and others and is expected to distribute assets to maxus creditors in accordance with the trust agreement and plan in june 2018 the trust filed its complaint against ypf and repsol in delaware bankruptcy court asserting claims based upon among other things fraudulent transfer and alter ego during 2019 the bankruptcy court denied repsols and ypfs motions to dismiss the complaint as well as their motions to move the case away from the bankruptcy court discovery remains ongoing 





environmental costs 

occidental’s environmental costs some of which include estimates are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended december 31 



operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures relate to longerlived improvements in properties currently operated by occidental remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations 



a portion of occidental’s assets are located outside north america the following table shows the geographic distribution of occidental’s assets as of december 31 2021 at both the segment and consolidated level related to occidental’s ongoing operations 



for the year ended december 31 2021 net sales outside north america totaled 42 billion or approximately 16 of total net sales 







the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires occidental’s management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts the selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management’s judgment 

oil and gas properties 

the carrying value of occidental’s property plant and equipment ppe represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset including any asset retirement obligations aros and capitalized interest net of dda and any impairment charges for assets acquired in a business combination ppe cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date aros and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets 

occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found if proved reserves have been found the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory drilling costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the economic and operating viability of the project at the end of each quarter management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities in particular whether occidental is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed 

occidental expenses annual lease rentals the costs of injectants used in production and geological and geophysical costs as incurred for exploration activities 

occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unitofproduction method it amortizes leasehold acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves as a result of occidentals midyear reserve review undertaken in the second quarter of 2021 dda rates for the second half of 2021 were lower compared to the first half of 2021 due to increased proved reserves primarily related to positive price revisions proved oil ngl and natural gas reserves were estimated during this midyear review using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month for the twelve months ended june 30 2021 unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

several factors could change occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves for example occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline generally occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices in other cases particularly with longlived properties lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical for such properties higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidental’s control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded changes in the political and regulatory climate could lead to decreases in proved reserves as development horizons may be extended into the future 

occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable if there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to significant and prolonged declines in current and forward prices significant changes in reserve estimates changes in management’s plans or other significant events management will evaluate the property for impairment under the successful efforts method if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the 





period individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows unless observable and comparable transactions are available the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants the impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time these assumptions include estimates of future production product prices contractual prices estimates of riskadjusted oil and gas proved and unproved reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs it is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in impairments 

for impairment testing unless prices are contractually fixed occidental uses observable forward strip prices for oil and natural gas prices when projecting future cash flows future operating and development costs are estimated using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce oil and gas reserves market prices for oil ngl and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future changes in global supply and demand transportation capacity currency exchange rates applicable laws and regulations and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions could impact current forecasts future fluctuations in commodity prices could result in estimates of future cash flows to vary significantly 

net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were 148 billion as of december 31 2021 and 186 billion as of december 31 2020 the unproved amounts are not subject to dda until they are classified as proved properties individually insignificant unproved properties are combined and amortized on a group basis based on factors such as lease terms success rates and other factors to provide for full amortization upon lease expiration or abandonment 

significant unproved properties primarily as a result of the acquisition are assessed individually for impairment and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recovered a valuation allowance is provided if an impairment is indicated occidental periodically reviews significant unproved properties for impairments numerous factors are considered including but not limited to availability of funds for future exploration and development activities current exploration and development plans favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property or the adjacent property geologists’ evaluation of the property the current and projected political and regulatory climate contractual conditions and the remaining lease term for the properties if an impairment is indicated occidental will first determine whether a comparable transaction for similar properties or implied acreage valuation derived from domestic onshore market participants is available and will adjust the carrying amount of the unproved property to its fair value using the market approach in situations where the market approach is not observable and unproved reserves are available undiscounted future net cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based on managements’ risk adjusted estimates of unproved reserves future commodity prices and future costs to produce the reserves if undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property the future net cash flows are discounted and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record occidental utilizes the same assumptions and methodology discussed above for cash flows associated with proved properties 

proved reserves 

occidental estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the sec and financial accounting standards board this definition includes oil ngl and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods government regulations etc at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions for reserves information see the supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities under item 8 of this form 10k 

engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information occidental’s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons these estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised either upward or downward as warranted by additional data revisions are necessary due to changes in among other things development plans reservoir performance prices economic conditions and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date a material adverse change in the estimated volume of proved reserves could have a negative impact on dda and could result in property impairments 

the most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in occidental’s oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the dda rate for example a 5 increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the dda rate by approximately 065bbl which would increase or decrease pretax income by approximately 275 million annually at current production rates 





fair values 

occidental estimates fairvalue of longlived assets for impairment testing assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in nonmonetary transactions pension plan assets and initial measurements of aros 

accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value 

occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs when estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed occidental must apply various assumptions 

financial assets and liabilities 

occidental utilizes published prices or counterparty statements for valuing the majority of its financial assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value in addition to using market data occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value occidental measures fair value using the following methods 

■ occidental values exchangecleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date these derivatives are classified as using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities level 1 

■ overthecounter otc bilateral financial commodity contracts international exchange contracts options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industrystandard models that consider various inputs including quoted forward prices for commodities time value volatility factors credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments as well as other relevant economic measures substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 

■ occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves the assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as using unobservable inputs level 3 within the valuation hierarchy 

■ occidental values debt using marketobservable information for debt instruments that are traded on secondary markets for debt instruments that are not traded the fair value is determined by interpolating the value based on debt with similar terms and credit risk 

nonfinancial assets 

occidental uses marketobservable prices for assets when comparable transactions can be identified that are similar to the asset being valued when occidental is required to measure fair value and there is not a marketobservable price for the asset or for a similar asset then the cost or income approach is used depending on the quality of information available to support management’s assumptions the cost approach is based on management’s best estimate of the current asset replacement cost the income approach is based on management’s best assumptions regarding expectations of future net cash flows and the expected cash flows are discounted using a commensurate riskadjusted discount rate such evaluations involve significant judgment the results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput development and operating costs and the timing thereof economic and regulatory climates and other factors most of which are often outside of management’s control however assumptions used reflect a market participant’s view of longterm prices costs and other factors and are consistent with assumptions used in occidental’s business plans and investment decisions 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate occidental records environmental liabilities and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the environmental remediation liability and the range of reasonably possible additional losses occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience remedial objectives available technologies applicable laws and regulations and costsharing arrangements occidental bases its environmental remediation liabilities on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred using the most costeffective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective occidental periodically reviews its environmental remediation liabilities and adjusts them as new information becomes available occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received or when receipt of recovery is 





highly probable 

many factors could affect occidental’s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental remediation liabilities and the range of reasonably possible additional losses the most significant are 1 cost estimates for remedial activities may vary from the initial estimate 2 the length of time type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination 3 a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify occidental’s proposed remedial plan 4 improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs 5 laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability and 6 changes in allocation or costsharing arrangements may occur 

certain sites involve multiple parties with various costsharing arrangements which fall into the following three categories 1 environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties 2 oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest or 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of properties in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs in these circumstances occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate when estimating occidental’s ultimate share of liability occidental records its environmental remediation liabilities at its expected net cost of remedial activities and based on these factors believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved 

in addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures which often take in excess of 10 years at cercla npl sites occidental’s environmental remediation liabilities include management’s estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and adjusts its environmental remediation liabilities accordingly 

if occidental were to adjust the balance of its environmental remediation liabilities based on the factors described above the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings for example if the balance were reduced by 10 occidental would record a pretax gain of 110 million if the balance were increased by 10 occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 110 million 

income taxes 

occidental files various us federal state and foreign income tax returns the impact of changes in tax regulations are reflected when enacted in general deferred federal state and foreign income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis occidental routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets if occidental concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance occidental recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefit recorded is equal to the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized through final settlement with a taxing authority interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense benefit see note 10  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

loss contingencies 

occidental is involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings and audits occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis 

loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate management’s judgments could change based on new information changes in or interpretations of laws or regulations changes in management’s plans or intentions opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings or other factors see note 13  lawsuits claims commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 



general 

occidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil ngl and natural gas prices price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect occidental’s budgeted 2022 pretax annual income by approximately 200 million for a 1 per barrel change in oil prices and approximately 30 million for a 1 per barrel change in ngl prices if domestic natural gas prices varied by 010 per mcf it would have an estimated annual effect on occidental’s budgeted 2022 pretax income of approximately 40 million these pricechange sensitivities include the impact of psc and similar contract volume changes on income if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidental’s results to prices also will change marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil natural gas and to a lesser degree other commodities a 025 change in the midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads impacts budgeted 2022 operating cash flows by approximately 65 million 

occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices a variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of 10 per ton would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 10 million and 30 million respectively a variation in pvc prices of 001 per lb would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 30 million historically over time product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins 

occidental uses forwards derivative instruments to manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations for oil and natural gas and swaps to manage interest rate risks 

risk management 

occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies the controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check members of the risk management group report to the corporate vice president and treasurer controls for these activities include limits on value at risk limits on credit limits on total notional trade value segregation of duties delegation of authority daily price verifications reporting to senior management on various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls 

fair value of marketing derivative contracts 

occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value fair values for these contracts are derived from level 1 and level 2 sources the fair values in future maturity periods are insignificant 

the following table shows the fair value of occidental’s derivatives excluding collateral segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation 



quantitative information 

occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities this measure determines the maximum potential negative one day change in fair value with a 95 level of confidence additionally occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice as a result of these controls occidental believes that the market risk of its trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance 







general 

occidental pays fixed interest rates and receives a floating interest rate indexed to threemonth libor on its interest rate swaps the remaining swaps have mandatory termination dates in september 2022 and 2023 with notional amounts of 275 million and 450 million respectively as of december 31 2021 as of december 31 2021 occidental had a net liability of approximately 428 million based on the fair value of the swaps of negative 751 million netted against 323 million in posted cash collateral a 25basis point decrease in implied libor rates over the term of the swaps would result in an additional liability of approximately 88 million on these swaps 

as of december 31 2021 occidental had variable rate debt with a notional value of 68 million outstanding a 25basis point increase in libor interest rates would increase gross interest expense approximately 17 million per year 

as of december 31 2021 occidental had fixed rate debt with a fair value of 311 billion outstanding a 25basis point change in treasury rates would change the fair value of the fixed rate debt approximately 629 million 

the table below provides information about occidental’s longterm debt obligations debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date 



a excluded net unamortized debt premiums of 670 million and debt issuance costs of 135 million 

b in january 2022 occidental used cash on hand to repay 101 million in outstanding 2600 senior notes due april 2022 at face value 



occidental’s international operations have limited currency risk occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes a vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in united states dollars additionally all of occidental’s consolidated international oil and gas subsidiaries have the united states dollar as the functional currency the effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income 



the majority of occidental’s counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and any inability of these customers to meet their settlement commitments occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants as appropriate occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits occidental also enters into futures contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers which are subject to minimal credit risk if any 

certain otc derivative instruments contain creditriskcontingent features primarily tied to credit ratings for occidental or its counterparties which may affect the amount of collateral that each party would need to post the fair value of derivative instruments with creditriskcontingent features that were net liabilities as of december 31 2021 was 107 million net of 323 million collateral and 104 million net of 374 million collateral as of december 31 2020 creditriskcontingent features are primarily related to interest rate swaps 

as of december 31 2021 the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties occidental believes its exposure to creditrelated losses as of december 31 2021 was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented 








 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

occidental had no changes in and no disagreements with occidental’s accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 




 item 9a controls and procedures 



the management of occidental petroleum corporation and its subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting occidental’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap occidental’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and divestitures of occidental’s assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap and that occidental’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of occidental’s management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of occidental’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to occidental’s business and operations 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and the ultimate effect on our operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected the global economy disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility in the financial markets in addition the pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions business closures and the institution of quarantining and other restrictions on movement in many communities as a result there has been a significant reduction in demand for and prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas if the reduced demand for and prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas persist for a prolonged period our operations financial condition cash flows level of expenditures and the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties may be materially and adversely affected our operations also may be adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic we have implemented workplace restrictions in our offices and work sites for health and safety reasons and continue to monitor national state and local government directives where we have operations andor offices further our business plan including our financing and liquidity plan includes among other things planned divestitures if general economic conditions or conditions in the energy industry persist at current levels for an extended period of time we may not be able to complete these transactions on favorable terms in a timely manner or at all the extent to which the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic the covid19 pandemic may also materially adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations to the extent the covid19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business operations financial condition and operating results it may also have the effect of heightening the other risks described herein 

volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products particularly oil and to a lesser extent ngl and its chemical products and natural gas 

prices for oil ngl and natural gas fluctuate widely historically the markets for oil ngl and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future if the prices of oil ngl or natural gas continue to be volatile or decline occidental’s operations financial condition cash flows level of expenditures and the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties may be materially and adversely affected prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in occidental’s control these factors include among others 

■ worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for oil ngl natural gas and refined products 

■ the cost of exploring for developing producing refining and marketing oil ngl natural gas and refined products 

■ operational impacts such as production disruptions technological advances and regional market conditions including available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints in producing areas 

■ changes in weather patterns and climate 

■ the impacts of the members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and other nonopec memberproducing nations that may agree to and maintain production levels 

■ the worldwide military and political environment including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities or acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere 

■ the price and availability of alternative and competing fuels 

■ technological advances affecting energy consumption and supply 

■ domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes 

■ shareholder activism or activities by nongovernmental organizations to restrict the exploration development and production of oil ngl and natural gas 

■ additional or increased nationalization and expropriation activities by foreign governments 

■ the impact and uncertainty of world health events including the covid19 pandemic 





■ volatility in commodity markets 

■ the effect of energy conservation efforts and 

■ global inventory levels and general economic conditions 

the longterm effects of these and other conditions on the prices of oil ngl natural gas and refined products are uncertain and there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for occidental’s products will follow historic patterns or recover meaningfully in the nearterm prolonged or substantial decline or sustained market uncertainty in these commodity prices may have the following effects on occidental’s business 

■ adversely affect occidental’s financial condition liquidity ability to reduce debt pay dividends and finance planned capital expenditures ability to repurchase shares and results of operations 

■ reduce the amount of oil ngl and natural gas that occidental can produce economically 

■ cause occidental to delay or postpone some of its capital projects 

■ reduce occidental’s revenues operating income or cash flows 

■ reduce the amounts of occidental’s estimated proved oil ngl and natural gas reserves 

■ reduce the carrying value of occidental’s oil and natural gas properties due to recognizing impairments of proved properties unproved properties and exploration assets 

■ reduce the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil ngl and natural gas reserves 

■ limit occidental’s access to or increase the cost of sources of capital such as equity and longterm debt and 

■ adversely affect the ability of occidental’s partners to fund their working interest capital requirements 

generally occidental’s historical practice has been to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities in 2019 occidental entered into 2020 brentpriced 3way collars combined with 2021 call options on the same volume to manage its nearterm exposure to cash flow variability from oil price risks in 2020 the 2021 call options were sold to enhance the upside retention in 2020 in 2020 management elected to hedge a portion of occidental’s expected 2021 natural gas production to enhance cash flow stability in the future management may continue to hedge some of the risk of oil ngl and natural gas price fluctuations commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to regulatory counterparty credit and other risks 

the prices obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate to the health of the united states and global economies as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

occidental may experience delays cost overruns losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities 

oil ngl and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil ngl and natural gas production in its development and exploration activities occidental bears the risks of 

■ equipment failures 

■ construction delays 

■ escalating costs or competition for services materials supplies or labor 

■ property or border disputes 

■ disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance 

■ title problems and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns 

■ actions by thirdparty operators of our properties 

■ delays and costs of drilling wells on lands subject to complex development terms and circumstances and 

■ oil ngl and natural gas gathering transportation and processing availability restrictions or limitations 

exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses 

governmental actions and political instability may affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s businesses are subject to the actions and decisions of many federal state local and foreign governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 

■ new or amended laws and regulations or new or different applications or interpretations of existing laws and regulations including those related to drilling manufacturing or production processes including flaring well stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and acidization pipelines labor and employment taxes royalty rates permitted production rates entitlements import export and use of raw materials equipment or products use 





or increased use of land water and other natural resources safety the manufacturing of chemicals asset integrity management the marketing or export of commodities security and environmental protection all of which may restrict or prohibit activities of occidental or its contractors increase occidental’s costs or reduce demand for occidental’s products in addition violation of certain governmental laws and regulations may result in strict joint and several liability and the imposition of significant civil and criminal fines and penalties 

■ refusal of or delay in the extension or grant of exploration development or production contracts and 

■ development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for or denial of drilling construction environmental and other regulatory approvals permits and authorizations 

the following are examples of actions and decisions recently taken by federal and state governments that impact occidental’s businesses 

in january 2021 the colorado oil and gas conservation commission cogcc adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements or “setbacks” on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures pursuant to the regulations well pads cannot be located within 500 feet of an occupied structure without the consent of the property owner as part of the permitting process the cogcc will consider a series of siting requirements for all drilling locations located between 500 feet and 2000 feet of an occupied structure alternatively the operator may seek a waiver from each owner and tenant within the designated distance while occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these regulations on its business at this time occidental does not anticipate significant nearterm changes to our development program in the dj basin based on these regulations however as a result certain of occidental’s proved undeveloped pud reserves have been derecognized as they no longer meet the regulatory certainty criteria to be considered proved reserves occidental’s ability to reestablish previously derecognized pud reserves as well as establishing new pud locations will depend upon occidental establishing a history of obtaining drilling permits under the new regulations and thus meeting the sec’s “reasonably certain” threshold for adding pud reserves occidental currently believes it will be able to successfully navigate the new setback guidelines 

an executive order was issued in january 2021 tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad  that mandated an indefinite pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands onshore and offshore while a comprehensive review of oil and gas permitting and leasing process is conducted by the us department of the interior in conducting this review the secretary of the interior is required to consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs 

in addition effective january 20 2021 the department of the interior issued an order temporarily elevating the decisionmaking approval previously delegated to the department of the interior’s agencies and bureaus including the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of land management blm to issue any onshore and offshore fossil fuel authorization for including but not limited to a lease amendment to a lease affirmative extension of a lease contract or other agreement or permit to drill to the leadership of the department of the interior occidental is continuing to evaluate the overall impact of these new regulatory issuances on its oil and gas operations on federal leases 

in addition occidental has experienced and may continue to experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability nationalizations corruption armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources 

occidental’s oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves 

results of operations reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend in part on occidental’s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves occidental has many competitors including national oil companies some of which i are larger and better funded ii may be willing to accept greater risks iii have greater access to capital iv have substantially larger staffs or v have special competencies competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts further during periods of low product prices any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts also there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry our failure to acquire properties grow production replace reserves and attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 

in addition occidental’s acquisition activities carry risks that it may i not fully realize anticipated benefits due to lessthanexpected reserves or production or changed circumstances such as declines in oil ngl and natural gas prices ii bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties iii experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity or iv be subject to liabilities that are greater than anticipated 





occidental’s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability including production decline rates operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices future operating costs and capital expenditures workover and remedial costs assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies the quantity quality and interpretation of relevant data taxes and availability of funds the procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants however there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves actual production revenues expenditures oil ngl and natural gas prices and taxes with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates and the variance may be material if occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected 

in addition the discounted cash flows included in this form 10k should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year in accordance with sec regulations actual future prices and costs may differ materially from sec regulationcompliant prices and costs used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves also actual future net cash flows may differ from these discounted net cash flows due to the amount and timing of actual production availability of financing for capital expenditures necessary to develop our undeveloped reserves supply and demand for oil ngl and natural gas increases or decreases in consumption of oil ngl and natural gas and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 

climate change and further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may adversely affect occidental’s operations or results 

continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional and local legislation and regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in december 2009 the environmental protection agency epa determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are according to the epa contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes based on these findings the epa began adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the clean air act the current administration has identified climate change as a priority and has issued new executive orders and regulatory actions prohibiting or restricting oil and gas development activities in certain areas as an example in january 2021 the actions undertaken by the department of the interior to temporarily elevate the decisionmaking approval process for new fossil fuel leases or permits in addition the united states has reentered the paris agreement which requires countries to periodically review and represent a progression in greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and an executive order was issued protecting public health and the environment and restoring science to tackle the climate crisis  in the future the united states may choose to adhere to other international agreements targeting greenhouse gas reductions and there may be new executive orders regulatory actions andor legislation targeting greenhouse gas emissions or prohibiting or restricting oil and gas development activities 

however in the current absence of federal legislation to significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to date many state governments have established rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions some including greenhouse gas cap and trade programs most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels including refineries and natural gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances 

these and other government actions relating to greenhouse gas emissions could require occidental to incur increased operating and maintenance costs including higher rates charged by service providers costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems to acquire emission allowances pay carbon taxes or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements or prevent occidental from conducting oil and gas development activities in certain areas or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for oil ngl and natural gas and other products that occidental’s businesses produce any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming and thereby reduce demand for oil ngl natural gas or other products produced by occidental’s businesses and lower the value of its reserves consequently government actions designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on occidental’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows and reserves 

it is difficult to predict the timing and certainty of such government actions and their ultimate effect on occidental which could depend on among other things the type and extent of greenhouse gas reductions required the availability and price of emission allowances or credits the availability and price of alternative fuel sources the energy sectors covered and occidental’s ability to recover the costs incurred through its operating agreements or the pricing of its oil ngl natural gas and other products and whether service providers are able to pass increased costs through to occidental 

there also have been efforts in the investment community including investment advisers and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds as well as other stakeholders promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves such environmental activism and 





initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could adversely affect our business activities operations and ability to access capital such initiatives could cause the market value of our securities to decrease our cost of capital to increase and adversely affect our reputation finally increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against occidental without regard to causation or our contribution to the asserted damage which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business occidental has been named in certain private litigation relating to these matters 

occidental has recorded impairments of its proved and unproved oil and gas properties and will continue to assess further impairments in the future 

we have recorded impairments of our proved and unproved oil and gas properties resulting from prolonged declines in oil and gas prices and may record such impairments in the future past impairments include pretax impairment and related charges to both proved and unproved oil and gas properties and a lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment for crude inventory in 2020 occidental recognized a pretax impairment to its oil and gas proved and unproved properties of 92 billion if there is a worsening of the macroeconomic conditions and if such worsened condition is expected to or does persist for a prolonged period of time occidental’s oil and gas properties may be subject to further testing for impairment which could result in additional noncash asset impairments such impairments could be material to the financial statements 

occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic events 

the occurrence of events such as hurricanes floods droughts earthquakes or other acts of nature well blowouts pandemics fires explosions pipeline ruptures chemical releases oil releases including maritime releases releases into navigable waters and groundwater contamination material or mechanical failure industrial accidents physical attacks abnormally pressured or structured formations and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates coastal operations are particularly susceptible to disruption from extreme weather events any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of 

■ damage to and destruction of property and equipment including property and equipment owned by thirdparties which our operations rely upon 

■ damage to natural resources 

■ pollution and other environmental damage including spillage or mishandling of recovered chemicals or fluids 

■ regulatory investigations and penalties 

■ loss of well location acreage expected production and related reserves 

■ suspension or delay of our operations 

■ substantial liability claims and 

■ repair and remediation costs 

thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses in addition under certain circumstances we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of properties that we own lease or operate as a result we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities for environmental matters for which we do not have insurance coverage which could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration development or acquisitions or cause us to incur losses 

occidental uses co 2 for its eor operations occidental’s production from these operations may decline if occidental is not able to obtain sufficient amounts of co 2  

occidental’s co 2 eor operations are critical to occidental’s longterm strategy oil production from occidental’s co 2 eor projects depends largely on having access to sufficient amounts of naturally occurring or anthropogenic co 2  occidental’s ability to produce oil from its co 2 eor projects would be hindered if the supply of co 2 was limited due to among other things problems with current co 2 producing wells and facilities including compression equipment catastrophic pipeline failure or the ability to economically purchase naturally occurring or anthropogenic co 2  this could have a material adverse effect on occidental’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows future oil production from its co 2 eor operations is dependent on the timing volumes and location of co 2 injections and in particular occidental’s ability to obtain sufficient volumes of co 2  market conditions may cause the delay or cancellation of the development of naturally occurring co 2 sources or construction of plants that produce anthropogenic co 2 as a byproduct that can be purchased thus limiting the amount of co 2 available for use in occidental’s co 2 eor operations 

occidental is exposed to cyberrelated risks 

the oil and gas industry is increasingly dependent on digital and industrial control technologies to conduct certain exploration development and production activities occidental relies on digital and industrial control systems related 





infrastructure technologies and networks to run its business and to control and manage its oil and gas chemicals marketing and pipeline operations use of the internet cloud services mobile communication systems and other public networks exposes occidental’s business and that of other third parties with whom occidental does business to cyber attacks cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years 

information and industrial control technology system failures network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results resulting in the unintentional disclosure of company partner customer or employee information or could damage our reputation a cyber attack involving our information or industrial control systems and related infrastructure or that of our business associates could negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways including but not limited to the following 

■ unauthorized access to seismic data reserves information strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and natural gas resources 

■ data corruption communication or systems interruption or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in delays and failure to reach the intended target or cause a drilling incident 

■ data corruption communication or systems interruption or operational disruptions of productionrelated infrastructure could result in a loss of production or accidental discharge 

■ a cyber attack on our chemical operations could result in a disruption of the manufacturing and marketing of our products or a potential environmental hazard 

■ a cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt our construction and development projects 

■ a cyber attack on thirdparty gathering pipeline processing terminal or other infrastructure systems could delay or prevent us from transporting processing and marketing our production 

■ a cyber attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities 

■ a cyber attack that halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feedstock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market 

■ a cyber attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption 

■ a cyber attack on our automated and surveillance systems could cause a loss in production and potential environmental hazards 

■ a deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of noncompliance which could then lead to regulatory fines or penalties and 

■ a cyber attack resulting in the loss or disclosure of or damage to our or any of our customer’s or supplier’s data or confidential information could harm our business by damaging our reputation subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability and requiring us to incur significant costs including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps 

even though occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of a cyber attack that it believes are reasonable there can be no assurance that such cyber security measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches of its systems from occurring and if a breach occurs it may remain undetected for an extended period of time further occidental has no control over the comparable systems of the third parties with whom it does business while occidental has experienced cyber attacks in the past occidental has not suffered any material losses however if in the future occidental’s cyber security measures are compromised or prove insufficient the potential consequences to occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant as cyber attacks continue to evolve in magnitude and sophistication occidental may be required to expend additional resources in order to continue to enhance occidental’s cyber security measures and to investigate and remediate any digital and operational systems related infrastructure technologies and network security vulnerabilities which would increase our costs a system failure or data security breach or a series of such failures or breaches could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

occidental’s oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect occidental’s business 

producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors unless occidental conducts successful exploration or development activities acquires properties containing proved reserves or both proved reserves will generally decline and negatively impact our business the value of our securities and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace reserves that are depleted by production or replace our declining production with new production occidental expects improved recovery extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors such as geology government regulations and permits the effectiveness of development plans and the ability to make the necessary capital investments or acquire capital are partially or fully outside management’s control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations 





occidental’s operations and financial results could be significantly negatively impacted by its offshore operations 

occidental is vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our operations and financial results occidental conducts offshore operations in the gulf of mexico and ghana occidental’s operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by conditions in some of these areas and are also vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore including those relating to the following 

■ hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions 

■ geological complexities and water depths associated with such operations 

■ limited number of partners available to participate in projects 

■ oilfield service costs and availability 

■ compliance with environmental safety and other laws and regulations 

■ terrorist attacks or piracy 

■ remediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials 

■ failure of equipment or facilities and 

■ response capabilities for personnel equipment or environmental incidents 

in addition occidental conducts some of its exploration in deep waters greater than 1000 feet where operations support services and decommissioning activities are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters the deep waters in the gulf of mexico as well as international deepwater locations lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters as a result deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and the time that occidental can market its production thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations 

additional domestic and international deepwater drilling laws regulations and other restrictions delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration development oil spill response and decommissioning plans and other offshorerelated developments may have a material adverse effect on occidental’s business financial condition or results of operations 

boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee have imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters in addition these governmental agencies are continuing to evaluate develop and implement new more restrictive regulatory requirements which could result in additional costs delays restrictions or obligations with respect to oil exploration and production operations conducted offshore for example the boem has considered and may adopt supplemental bonding procedures for the decommissioning of offshore wells platforms pipelines and other facilities which may be material compliance with these more stringent regulatory requirements and with existing environmental and oil spill regulations together with any uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits or exploration development oil spill response and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts 

occidental’s indebtedness may make it more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in its business further downgrades in occidental’s credit ratings or future increases in interest rates may negatively impact occidental’s cost of and ability to access the capital markets 

occidental’s level of indebtedness could increase occidental’s vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions economic downturns and adverse developments in its business andor limit occidental’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and the industries in which it operates from time to time occidental has relied on access to the capital markets for funding including in connection with the acquisition there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to occidental in the future on acceptable terms or at all occidental’s ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing will be subject to a number of factors including general economic and market conditions occidental’s performance investor sentiment and its ability to meet existing debt compliance requirements if occidental is unable to generate sufficient funds from its operations to satisfy its capital requirements including its existing debt obligations or to raise additional capital on acceptable terms occidental’s business could be adversely affected as of december 31 2020 occidental’s longterm debt was rated bb by fitch ratings ba2 by moody’s investors service and bb by standard and poor’s any additional downgrade in the credit rating of occidental could negatively impact its cost of and ability to access capital and to effectively execute aspects of its strategy and may require occidental to provide cash collateral letters of credit or other forms of security under certain contractual agreements which would increase occidental’s operating costs and reduce liquidity as a result further downgrades in occidental’s credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on occidental’s financial condition operating results or liquidity 





further a portion of occidental’s indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates some of which is tied to the london interbank offered rate libor in july 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after the end of 2021 in early december 2020 the administrator for libor proposed subject to market consultation to end the publication of one week and two month usd libor after december 2021 and remaining usd libor tenors in mid2023 at the same time major us bank regulators called upon banks to cease entering into new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate by the end of 2021 at the latest the alternative reference rates committee a group of market participants convened under the auspices of the us federal reserve board and other us regulators has recommended the secured overnight financing rate sofr calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities as its recommended alternative benchmark rate to replace usd libor 

however at this time it is not known whether or when sofr or other proposed alternative reference rates will attain market traction as replacements for libor and the proposal to cease publication of major usd libor tenors by mid2023 is not yet final it is not possible to predict the effect of these changes other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere these reforms and other pressures will likely cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but may include an increase in the cost of occidental’s variable rate indebtedness including floating rate notes and interest rate swaps which may have an adverse effect on occidental’s financial condition operating results or cash flows 

anadarko’s tronox settlement may not be deductible for income tax purposes occidental may be required to repay the tax refund anadarko received in 2016 related to the deduction of the tronox settlement payment which may have a material adverse effect on occidental’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

in april 2014 anadarko and kerrmcgee corporation and certain of its subsidiaries collectively kerrmcgee entered into a settlement agreement for 52 billion resolving all claims that were or could have been asserted in connection with the may 2009 lawsuit filed by tronox against anadarko and kerrmcgee in the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york after the settlement became effective in january 2015 anadarko paid 52 billion and deducted this payment on its 2015 federal income tax return due to the deduction anadarko had a net operating loss carryback for 2015 which resulted in a tentative tax refund of 881 million in 2016 

the irs has audited anadarko’s tax position regarding the deductibility of the payment and in september 2018 issued a statutory notice of deficiency rejecting anadarko’s refund claim anadarko disagreed and filed a petition with the us tax court to dispute the disallowance in november 2018 the case was in the irs appeals process until the second quarter of 2020 however it has since been returned to the us tax court where occidental expects to continue pursuing resolution in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic 740’s guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2020 occidental has recorded no tax benefit on the tentative cash tax refund if the payment is ultimately determined not to be deductible occidental would be required to repay the tentative refund received plus interest totaling approximately 12 billion as of december 31 2020 which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and consolidated balance sheets occidental’s consolidated financial statements include an uncertain tax position for the tentative cash tax refund 898 million in federal taxes and 27 million in state taxes plus accrued interest of approximately 255 million this amount is not covered by insurance for additional information on income taxes see note 11  lawsuits claims commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

occidental may not be able to complete its planned divestitures of certain assets on favorable terms or at all 

since the acquisition occidental has realized 82 billion of aftertax net proceeds from significant asset divestitures the completion of any future divestitures will be subject to customary closing conditions and certain of the divestitures may be conditioned on the receipt of required government and regulatory approvals occidental may not be able to complete its planned divestitures on favorable terms in a timely manner or at all any difficulties with respect to the completion of the planned divestitures could have a material adverse effect on occidental’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor stock price see note 4  divestitures and other transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for information about the total transaction 

occidental’s future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to execute new business strategies effectively 

occidental’s results of operations depend on the extent to which it can execute new business strategies effectively occidental’s strategies which include reaching netzero emissions with its operations before 2040 are subject to business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond its control additionally occidental may be forced to develop or implement new technologies at substantial costs to achieve its strategies these uncertainties and costs could cause occidental to not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results and benefits of its business strategies

the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements which are included in this form 10k in item 8 and the information set forth in risk factors under part 1 item 1a 









general 

occidental’s operations financial condition cash flows and levels of expenditures are highly dependent on oil prices and to a lesser extent ngl and natural gas prices the midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads and the prices it receives for its chemical products the worldwide economy has been severely impacted by the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic which began during the first quarter of 2020 in the first quarter travel restrictions and stayathome orders were implemented for much of the world to limit the spread of covid19 though certain restrictions have been lifted some areas have recently reinstated stay at home orders and oil and gas demand remains below prepandemic levels on april 12 2020 certain members of the opec and 10 nonopec partner countries opec agreed to production cuts intended to mitigate the oil supply and demand imbalance to stabilize prices on january 5 2021 opec agreed to extend the cuts through march 2021 these production cuts coupled with declining us production helped mitigate the supply and demand imbalance while the spot wti oil price has recovered to above 6000bbl as of the date of this filing the average daily wti oil price fell from 5703bbl in 2019 to 3940bbl in 2020 or 31 percent we expect that the oil supply and demand balance and consequently oil prices in the nearterm will continue to be influenced by the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic the effectiveness and pace of the distribution of the recently approved vaccines and opec and us production levels 

liquidity 

in response to the dramatic drop in oil prices and the current macroeconomic environment occidental has taken significant measures to increase its near and midterm liquidity and address nearterm debt maturities specifically during 2020 occidental 

■ reduced its 2020 capital budget to 26 billion from a range of 52 billion to 54 billion a midpoint reduction of approximately 50 

■ made significant cuts to its 2020 operating and corporate costs on an annualized basis occidental has realized 15 billion of overhead savings and over 900 million in operating cost savings of which a majority is expected to remain permanent in future years 

■ reduced the quarterly common stock dividend to 001 per share from 079 per share effective july 2020 which on an annualized basis will reduce its common stock dividend outlay by approximately 29 billion 

■ elected to pay the preferred stock dividend paid in the second and third quarters of 2020 in the form of shares of common stock in lieu of cash preserving 400 million of liquidity occidental elected to pay the dividend paid in the fourth quarter in cash the board of directors will continue to assess market conditions and occidentals financial condition on a quarterly basis to determine whether the preferred stock dividend will be paid in shares of stock in cash or a combination of shares of common stock and cash 

■ entered into a new receivable securitization facility that provides additional liquidity of up to 400 million 

■ issued 70 billion in senior unsecured notes the senior notes offerings during 2020 to extend certain debt maturities in 20212023 to 20252031 

■ since the acquisition completed significant asset divestitures for net proceeds of approximately 82 billion 

■ used the net proceeds from asset sales cash on hand and senior notes offerings to retire or tender 60 billion of 2021 27 billion of 2022 and 264 million of 2023 maturities and 

■ exchanged approximately 279 million wes common units to retire a 260 million note payable to wes due 2038 

in 2019 occidental entered into threeway oil collar and call derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to commodity price risk and increase the predictability of nearterm cash flows the majority of the collars settled in 2020 with the receipt of cash of 960 million the remaining 52 million settled in 2021 see note 9  derivat ives in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

occidental believes the actions outlined above enhance its liquidity position to fund its operations occidental will continue to evaluate the economic environment as well as the commodity price environment and may make further adjustments to its future levels of expenditures and operating and corporate costs however the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on occidentals results of operations cash flows and financial position are unknown and those impacts could be material additionally actions taken in response to the current macroenvironment may result in the longterm reduction of its capital expenditure and production profile 

debt and interest rate swaps 

with the completion of the liquidity measures above as of the date of this filing occidental has debt maturities of approximately 371 million in 2021 21 billion in 2022 and 09 billion in 2023 

occidental’s 23 billion zero coupon senior notes due 2036 zero coupons can be put to occidental in october of each year in whole or in part for the then accreted value of the outstanding zero coupons an immaterial amount was put 





to occidental in 2020 the zero coupons can next be put to occidental in october 2021 which if put in whole would require a payment of approximately 10 billion at such date occidental currently has the intent and ability to meet this obligation including if necessary using amounts available under the revolving credit facility rcf should the put right be exercised 

interest rate swaps with a notional value of 750 million and fair value of 894 million as of december 31 2020 have mandatory termination dates in september 2021 interest rate swaps with a notional value of 725 million and fair value of 876 million as of december 31 2020 have mandatory termination dates in september 2022 and 2023 the interest rate swaps fair value and cash required to settle them on their termination dates will continue to fluctuate with changes in interest rates through the mandatory termination dates 

as of december 31 2020 occidental had approximately 20 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand as of the date of this filing 50 billion of borrowing capacity under its existing rcf which matures in 2023 occidental continues to pursue divestitures of certain assets and intends to use the net proceeds from asset sales and excess free cash flow to repay its nearerterm debt maturities but the expected timing and final proceeds from such asset sales are uncertain occidental currently expects its cash on hand and funds available under its rcf to be sufficient to meet its debt maturities operating expenditures and other obligations for the next 12 months from the date of this filing however given the inherent uncertainty associated with the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic and its resulting impact on oil demand occidental may need to raise capital to fund its operations and refinance debt maturities 

debt ratings 

in connection with the senior notes offerings occidentals longterm debt credit ratings were reviewed by the three major rating agencies as of december 31 2020 occidental’s longterm debt was rated bb by fitch ratings ba2 by moody’s investors service and bb by standard and poor’s any additional downgrade in credit ratings could impact occidentals ability to access capital markets and increase its cost of capital in addition given that occidental’s current debt ratings are noninvestment grade occidental may be requested and in some cases required to provide collateral in the form of cash letters of credit surety bonds or other acceptable support as financial assurance of its performance and payment obligations under certain contractual arrangements such as pipeline transportation contracts environmental remediation obligations oil and gas purchase contracts and certain derivative instruments 

as of the date of this filing occidental has provided required financial assurances through a combination of cash letters of credit and surety bonds and has not issued any letters of credit under the rcf or other committed facilities for additional information see risk factors in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

impact of covid19 pandemic to global operations 

occidental is focused on protecting the health and safety of its employees and contractors during the covid19 pandemic occidental has implemented workplace restrictions in our offices and work sites for health and safety reasons occidental has not incurred material costs as a result of new protocols and procedures occidental continues to monitor national state and local government directives where occidental has operations andor offices while occidental has not incurred any significant disruptions to its daytoday operations as a result of any workplace restrictions related to the covid19 pandemic to date the extent to which the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain 

recent governmental rule making and executive orders 

in january 2021 the cogcc adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements or “setbacks” on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures pursuant to the regulations well pads cannot be located within 500 feet of an occupied structure without the consent of the property owner as part of the permitting process the cogcc will consider a series of siting requirements for all drilling locations located between 500 feet and 2000 feet of an occupied structure alternatively the operator may seek a waiver from each owner and tenant within the designated distance while occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these regulations on its business at this time occidental does not anticipate significant nearterm changes to our development program in the dj basin based on these regulations however as a result certain of occidental’s pud reserves have been derecognized as they no longer meet the regulatory certainty criteria to be considered proved reserves occidental’s ability to reestablish previously derecognized pud reserves as well as establishing new pud locations will depend upon occidental establishing a history of obtaining drilling permits under the new regulations and thus meeting the sec’s “reasonably certain” threshold for adding pud reserves occidental currently believes it will be able to successfully navigate the new setback guidelines 

an executive order was issued in january 2021 tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad  that mandated an indefinite pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands onshore and offshore while a comprehensive review of oil and gas permitting and leasing is conducted by the us department of the interior in conducting this review the secretary of the interior shall consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs 

in addition effective january 20 2021 the department of the interior issued an order temporarily elevating the decisionmaking approval previously delegated to the department of the interior’s agencies and bureaus including the boem and the blm to issue any onshore and offshore fossil fuel authorization for including but not limited to a lease 





amendment to a lease affirmative extension of a lease contract or other agreement or permit to drill to the leadership of the department of the interior 

neither of these orders impact existing operations or permits for ongoing operations under valid leases and does not preclude the issuances of leases permits and other authorizations both of these orders align with the new governmental administration’s commitment to addressing climate change specifically both orders allow for the department of the interior to consider potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas activities on public lands or in offshore waters 

approximately 9 of occidental’s onshore net acres are on federal lands while all of its gulf of mexico leases are in federal waters 

occidental is continuing to evaluate the overall impact of these new regulatory issuances on its oil and gas operations on federal leases and will reallocate capital to nonfederal leases to the extent there are delays in obtaining permits and other authorizations that would alter the timing of development and exploration programs on federal leases 

strategy 

occidental is focused on delivering a unique shareholder value proposition with its combined integrated asset portfolio continual enhancements to its organizational capability and commitment to implement innovative carbon management and storage solutions for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions occidental conducts its operations with a focus on sustainability health safety and environmental and social responsibility capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner occidental aims to maximize shareholder returns through a combination of 

■ maximizing capital efficiency to sustain fourth quarter 2020 production levels in order to maximize free cash flow 

■ prioritizing projects to decrease its carbon footprint and create a business model to help other companies lower theirs 

■ reducing financial leverage and 

■ maintaining a robust liquidity position 

key performance indicators 

occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success against key performance indicators that drive total stockholder return in addition to efficient capital allocation and deployment discussed below in “oil and gas segment  business strategy” occidental believes the following are its most significant performance indicators 

safety 

■ injury incidence rate iir and days away restricted transfer rate dart  occidental’s combined employee and contractor iir is determined by multiplying the total number of occupational safety and health administration osha recordable injuries and illnesses by 200000 and dividing that result by the total number of hours worked by all employees and contractors the dart rate is calculated in the same manner as iir but uses the number of incidents that resulted in days away from work job transfer or restricted job duties instead of the number of recordable injuries or illnesses 

operational 

■ annual cost synergies  post acquisition occidental has focused on an annualized reduction in overhead and operating expense strategies from the historical amounts of occidental and anadarko and exceeded its initial goal of at least 11 billion by realizing 23 billion in total synergies and additional cost savings on an annualized basis in 2020 

■ total spend per barrel  in 2021 occidental will focus on controlling total costs from a perbarrel perspective total spend per barrel is the sum of capital spending general and administrative expenses other operating and nonoperating expenses and oil and gas lease operating costs divided by global oil ngl and natural gas sales volumes 

financial 

■ cash returns on capital employed croce  croce is calculated as i the cash flows from operating activities before changes in working capital plus distributions from wes divided by ii the average of the opening and closing balances of total equity plus total debt 

■ reduce financial leverage 

sustainability and environmental 

■ advancing specific carbon capture use and sequestration projects 

■ netzero operational and energy use emissions before 2040 with an ambition to achieve before 2035 

■ netzero total emissions inventory including product use with an ambition to achieve before 2050 and 

■ total carbon impact through carbon removal and storage technology and development past 2050 







business strategy 

occidental’s oil and gas segment focuses on longterm value creation and leadership in sustainability health safety and the environment in each core operating area occidental’s operations benefit from scale technical expertise decades of highmargin inventory environmental and safety leadership and commercial and governmental collaboration these attributes allow occidental to bring additional production quickly to market extend the life of older fields at lower costs and provide lowcost returnsdriven growth opportunities with advanced technology 

with the completion of the acquisition occidental became one of the largest us producers of liquids which includes oil condensate and ngl allowing occidental to maximize cash margins on a boe basis since the acquisition occidental has focused on its divestiture program to divest of noncore assets to pay down nearterm debt maturities however the advantages that occidental’s portfolio provides coupled with unmatched subsurface characterization ability and the proven ability to execute ensures that occidental is positioned for fullcycle success in the years ahead the oil and gas segment has realized synergies to deliver lower breakeven costs and generate excess free cash flow since the acquisition occidental completed the sale of significant noncore assets for net proceeds of approximately 82 billion 

despite the pandemic impacts on commodity prices and the overall economy as discussed above occidental’s assets are strategically positioned to provide a future portfolio of projects that are flexible and have shortcycle investment paybacks together with occidental’s technical capabilities the oil and gas segment strives to achieve low development and operating costs to maximize fullcycle value of the assets 

the oil and gas business implements occidental’s strategy primarily by 

■ operating and developing areas where reserves are known to exist and optimizing capital intensity in core areas primarily in the permian basin dj basin gulf of mexico uae oman and algeria 

■ maintaining a disciplined and prudent approach to capital expenditures with a focus on highreturn shortcycle cashflowgenerating opportunities and an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing occidental’s existing positions 

■ focusing occidental’s subsurface characterization and technical activities on unconventional opportunities primarily in the permian basin 

■ using eor techniques such as co 2  water and steam floods in mature fields and 

■ focusing on costreduction efficiencies and innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions 

in 2020 oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately 22 billion and primarily focused on occidental’s assets in the permian basin dj basin gulf of mexico and oman 

oil and gas price environment 

oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s financial performance the following table presents the average daily west texas intermediate wti and brent prices for oil in dollars per barrel bbl and new york mercantile exchange nymex natural gas prices for 2020 and 2019 



the following table presents occidental’s average realized prices for continuing operations as a percentage of wti brent and nymex for 2020 and 2019 



a prior period percentages have been adjusted to reflect the algeria operations as continuing operations 





prices and differentials can vary significantly even on a shortterm basis making it difficult to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty 

as a result of the expected prolonged period of lower commodity prices brought on by the covid19 pandemic’s impact on oil demand occidental tested substantially all of its oil and gas assets for impairment during the second quarter of 2020 occidental recognized pretax impairment charges of 64 billion related to continuing operations and 22 billion related to discontinued operations for the three months ended june 30 2020 while oil prices have modestly improved since the second quarter of 2020 if there was a worsening of the macroeconomic conditions caused by the impacts of covid19 and if such worsened condition was expected to be prolonged occidental’s oil and gas properties may be subject to further testing for impairment which could result in additional noncash asset impairments and such impairments could be material to our financial statements 

domestic interests 

business review 

occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both occidental’s domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to 10 years which is extended through the end of production once it commences occidental has leasehold and mineral interests in 95 million net acres of which approximately 52 is leased 24 is owned subsurface mineral rights and 24 is owned land with mineral rights 

the following chart shows occidental’s domestic production volumes for the previous three years in thousand barrels of oil equivalent mboe per day 





domestic assets a 



a map represents geographic outlines of the respective basins 

the permian basin 

the permian basin extends throughout west texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states accounting for more than 36 of total united states oil production in 2020 

occidental manages its permian basin operations through two business units permian resources which includes unconventional opportunities and permian eor which utilizes eor techniques such as co 2 floods and waterfloods occidental has a leading position in the permian basin producing approximately 13 of total oil in the basin by exploiting the natural synergies between permian resources and permian eor occidental is able to deliver unique short and longterm advantages efficiencies and expertise across its permian basin operations 

permian resources unconventional oil development projects provide very shortcycle investment payback averaging less than two years and generate some of the highest margin and returns of any oil and gas projects in the world these investments contribute cash flow while increasing longterm value and sustainability through higher return on capital employed occidental’s oil and gas operations in permian resources include approximately 16 million net acres in 2020 new well design and flowback methods were implemented which helped lower the overall well cost while improving recovery overall in 2020 permian resources produced approximately 435 mboed from approximately 6000 gross wells additionally in 2020 permian resources added 122 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe to occidental’s proved reserves for improved recovery additions 

the permian basin’s concentration of large conventional reservoirs favorable co 2 flooding performance and the expansive co 2 transportation and processing infrastructure has resulted in decades of highvalue enhanced oil production with 34 active co 2 floods and over 40 years of experience occidental is the industry leader in permian basin co 2 flooding which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10 to 25 technology improvements such as the recent trend toward vertical expansion of the co 2 flooded interval into residual oil zone targets continue to yield more recovery from existing projects occidental’s share of production from permian eor was approximately 140 mboed in 2020 

significant opportunities also remain to gain additional recovery by expanding occidental’s existing co 2 projects into new portions of reservoirs that have only been waterflooded permian eor has a large inventory of future co 2 projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated depending on market conditions in addition olcv continues making progress towards supplying anthropogenic or manmade co 2 for the purpose of carbon capture utilization and storage in occidental’s permian eor operations 

in 2020 occidental spent approximately 11 billion of capital in the permian basin of which over 87 was spent on permian resources assets also in 2020 occidental divested of certain noncore largely nonoperated acreage in the permian basin in 2021 occidental expects to allocate approximately 38 of its worldwide capital budget to the permian basin 





dj basin 

occidental remains colorado’s top oil and gas producer with interest in approximately 07 million net acres in colorado production is derived from 2500 operated vertical wells and 2100 operated horizontal wells primarily focused in 460000 net acres in the niobrara and codell formations the dj basin provides competitive economics low breakeven costs and free cash flow generation 

occidental produced approximately 293 mboed in the dj basin in 2020 horizontal drilling results in the field continue to be strong with improved operational efficiencies in drilling and completions in 2020 occidental drilled 65 operated horizontal wells and completed 117 operated horizontal wells 

occidental is currently fully permitted for all planned 2021 completions activity and has received drilling permits for all planned drilling activity through the first half of 2021 new statewide regulations were adopted in the fourth quarter of 2020 and became effective in midjanuary 2021 occidental’s focus for 2021 is continuing to build operational inventory while implementing the new regulations and maintaining social licenses to operate occidental additionally continues to have development optionality by flexing resources between the dj basin and another emerging high rateofreturn program in the powder river basin 

as discussed above in january 2021 the cogcc adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements or “setbacks” on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures while occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these regulations on its business at this time occidental does not anticipate significant nearterm changes to our development program in the dj basin based on these regulations however if occidental is unable to obtain new drilling permits to develop a significant portion of the company’s undeveloped acreage in the dj basin the company’s dj basin assets may be subject to testing for impairment and if deemed to be impaired such impairment could be material to our financial statements 

other domestic 

occidental holds approximately 50 million net acres in other domestic locations which is primarily comprised of the powder river basin north dj basin and wyoming occidentals share of production in other domestic locations was approximately 39 mboed in 2020 

offshore domestic assets 

gulf of mexico 

occidental owns a working interest in 182 blocks in the gulf of mexico operates 10 active floating platforms and holds interests in 17 active fields the gulf of mexico produced approximately 130 mboed during 2020 in 2021 occidental will continue to take advantage of its extensive infrastructure across the gulf of mexico to execute its longterm plan for development and exploration occidental will operate one floating drillship and one platform rig together with two multiservice vessels to cost effectively develop known resources 

occidental continues to work with the bsee and the boem to address the additional regulatory requirements to ensure a minimal disruption of activities in the gulf of mexico 

the following table shows areas of continuing development in the gulf of mexico along with the corresponding working interest in those areas 



international interests 

business review 

occidental conducts its ongoing international operations in two subregions the middle east and africa its activities include oil ngl and natural gas production through direct workinginterests and production sharing contracts psc 

production sharing contracts 

occidental’s interest in oman and qatar are subject to pscs under such contracts occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain development and production costs and an additional share for profit these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on 





occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher 

the following chart shows occidental’s international production volumes for the previous three years 

note operations sold exited or held for sale include the ghana assets held for sale at december 31 2020 and 2019 the colombia onshore assets sold in december 2020 and the qatar idd el shargi fields exited in 2019 

middle east  north africa assets 



algeria 

in april 2020 subsequent to communications with algerian government officials occidental determined that the sale of the algeria operations to total would not be consummated and the decision was made to continue to operate within algeria as a result occidental reclassified 2019 results to reflect the algeria operations as continuing operations operations in algeria involve production and development activities in 18 fields within blocks 404a and 208 which are located in the berkine basin in algeria’s sahara desert and are governed by a production sharing agreement psa between occidental sonatrach and other partners under this psa occidental is responsible for 245 of the development and production costs the el merk central processing facility cpf in block 208 processed produced oil and ngl while the hassi berkine 





south and ourhoud cpfs in block 404a processed produced oil in 2020 occidental drilled two development wells and plans to continue drilling operations throughout 2021 net production in algeria was 44 mboed in 2020 

oman 

in oman occidental is the operator of block 9 with a 50 working interest block 27 with a 65 working interest block 53 with a 47 working interest and block 62 with a 100 working interest occidental additionally has exploration and production sharing agreements for blocks 30 51 65 and 72 occidental holds 60 million gross acres and has 10000 potential well inventory locations in 2020 occidental’s share of production was 85 mboed 

the block 9 contract expires in 2030 and the block 27 contract expires in 2035 occidental’s share of production for blocks 9 and 27 was 30 mboed and six mboed in 2020 respectively the block 53 mukhaizna field contract expires in 2035 and is a major worldclass pattern steam flood project for eor that utilizes some of the largest mechanical vapor compressors ever built since assuming operations in mukhaizna in 2005 occidental has drilled over 3550 new wells and has increased gross production by over 15 fold occidental’s share of production for block 53 was 30 mboed in 2020 subject to a declaration of commerciality occidental’s permit for block 62 will expire in 2028 occidental’s share of production for block 62 was 19 mboed in 2020 

qatar 

in qatar occidental partners in the dolphin energy project an investment that is comprised of two separate economic interests occidental has a 245 interest in the upstream operations dolphin to develop and produce ngl natural gas and condensate from qatar’s north field through mid2032 occidental also has a 245 interest in dolphin energy limited which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in the midstream and marketing segment section in this form 10k under pipeline occidental’s net share of production from the dolphin upstream operations was 44 mboed in 2020 

united arab emirates 

in 2011 occidental acquired a 40 participating interest in the shah gas field al hosn gas joining with the abu dhabi national oil company adnoc in a 30year joint venture agreement in 2020 occidental’s share of production from al hosn gas was 238 mmcfd of natural gas and 38 mboed of ngl and condensate al hosn gas includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in the midstream and marketing segment section in this form 10k under gas processing gathering and co 2  

in 2019 and 2020 occidental acquired 9year exploration concessions and subject to a declaration of commerciality 35year production concessions adjacent to al hosn gas for onshore block 3 and block 5 which cover an area of approximately 15 million acres and 10 million acres respectively occidental conducts a majority of its middle east business development activities through its office in abu dhabi which also provides various support functions for occidental’s middle east oil and gas operations 

ghana  discontinued operations 

in may 2020 occidental and total mutually agreed to execute a waiver of the obligation to purchase and sell the ghana assets so that occidental could begin marketing the sale of the ghana assets to other third parties occidental is currently marketing the ghana assets the assets and liabilities for ghana remain presented as held for sale in discontinued operations at december 31 2020 ghana operations include production and development activities located offshore in the west cape three point block and the deepwater tano block occidental’s share of production in 2020 was 30 mboed 

latin america assets 

colombia 

in december 2020 occidental completed the sale of its colombia onshore assets specifically the operations and working interests in the llanos norte middle magdalena and putumayo basins occidental has retained a presence with exploration blocks offshore colombia 

proved reserves 

proved oil ngl and natural gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements oil ngl and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity quality and transportation costs 





the following table shows the 2020 2019 and 2018 calculated firstdayofthemonth average prices for both wti and brent oil prices as well as the henry hub gas prices measured in million british thermal units mmbtu 



a mt belvieu pricing was added as an ngl benchmark beginning in 2020 prior to 2020 wti oil was used as a benchmark for ngl 

occidental had proved reserves from continuing operations at yearend 2020 of 2911 mmboe compared to the yearend 2019 amount of 3904 mmboe proved developed pd reserves represented approximately 78 and 77 of occidental’s total proved reserves at yearend 2020 and 2019 respectively the following table shows the breakout of occidental’s proved reserves from continuing operations by commodity as a percentage of total proved reserves 



occidental does not have any reserves from nontraditional sources for further information regarding occidental’s proved reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information section in item 8 of this form 10k 

changes in proved reserves 

occidental’s total proved reserves from continuing operations decreased 993 mmboe in 2020 which was primarily driven by price and other revisions of 484 mmboe and asset divestitures of 241 mmboe these decreases were partially offset by increases from occidental’s development program of 212 mmboe changes in reserves were as follows 



occidental’s ability to add reserves other than through purchases depends on the success of improved recovery extension and discovery projects each of which depends on reservoir characteristics technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices as well as capital and operating costs many of these factors are outside management’s control and may negatively or positively affect occidental’s reserves 

revisions of previous estimates 

revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic production decline or operating performance data in addition product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental for example lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves particularly for domestic properties because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations offsetting this effect lower prices increase occidental’s share of proved reserves under pscs because more oil is required to recover costs conversely when prices rise occidental’s share of proved reserves decreases for pscs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data 

in 2020 occidental’s revisions of previous estimates of proved reserves were negative 484 mmboe of which approximately 342 mmboe were negative price revisions the negative price revisions were primarily associated with the 





permian basin 283 mmboe and the dj basin 74 mmboe which were partially offset by positive price revisions of 36 mmboe on international production sharing contracts 

an additional 197 mmboe of negative revisions were related to management changes in development plans due to lower average commodity prices compared to the prior year and the reallocation of capital to higher return projects these changes were primarily associated with the permian basin 143 mmboe 

further positive revisions of 57 mmboe net were associated with updates based on reservoir performance the remaining revisions were associated with various other cost related revisions 

improved recovery 

in 2020 occidental added proved reserves of 190 mmboe related to improved recovery primarily due to additional development drilling mainly in the permian basin which accounted for approximately twothirds of the reserve additions these properties comprise both unconventional projects and conventional projects which are characterized by the deployment of eor development methods largely employing application of co 2 flood waterflood or steam flood and unconventional projects these types of conventional eor development methods can be applied through existing wells though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells the use of either co 2 or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation the evaluation of engineering data availability and cost of either co 2 or steam and other economic factors both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells many of occidental’s projects including unconventional projects rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells in addition some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells further positive additions of 32 mmboe in the uae 13 mmboe in oman 9 mmboe in the dj basin and 9 mmboe in the gulf of mexico were similarly the result of development drilling 

extensions and discoveries 

occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs in 2020 extensions and discoveries added 22 mmboe primarily related to the recognition of proved reserves in the dj basin wyoming and oman 

purchases of proved reserves 

in 2020 occidental purchased proved reserves of 4 mmboe primarily consisting of proved reserves in the permian basin 

sales of proved reserves 

in 2020 occidental sold 241 mmboe in proved reserves primarily related to the divestitures of the colombia onshore assets the mineral acres and fee surface acres located in wyoming colorado and utah and the noncore largely nonoperated acreage in the permian basin 

proved undeveloped reserves 

occidental had proved undeveloped reserves at yearend 2020 of 645 mmboe compared to the yearend 2019 amount of 905 mmboe 

changes in proved undeveloped reserves were as follows 



total improved recovery additions of 132 mmboe were primarily the result of additional development drilling in the permian basin 80 mmboe international assets 41 mmboe and the dj basin 7 mmboe the 2020 additions to proved undeveloped reserves were offset by transfers to proved developed reserves and negative revisions of previous estimates transfers to proved developed reserves were a total of 104 mmboe the transfers were primarily associated with the dj basin 53 mmboe and the permian basin 48 mmboe revisions of previous estimates were a negative 253 mmboe approximately 123 mmboe of the negative revisions were related to management changes in development plans primarily associated with the permian basin 111 mmboe additionally the revisions include preliminary impacts related to the 





january 2021 cogcc regulation in the dj basin further 77 mmboe of negative revisions were associated with updates based on reservoir performance and 55 mmboe of negative revisions were associated with price revisions 

proved undeveloped reserves are supported by a fiveyear detailed fieldlevel development plan which includes the timing location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled only proved undeveloped reserves which are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan a portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved longterm development projects 

in 2020 occidental incurred approximately 05 billion to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves given the impact of the covid19 pandemic on demand and cash flows occidental reduced its 2020 capital expenditures from 52 billion to 26 billion and accordingly converted a lower than expected amount of reserves from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves in 2020 occidental converted approximately 17 of its puds to proved developed when adjusted for revisions and sales as of december 31 2020 occidental had 645 mmboe of puds of which 49 were associated with domestic onshore 8 with gulf of mexico and 43 with international assets 

occidental’s most active development areas are located in the permian basin which represented 36 of the proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 2020 approximately 40 of occidental’s 2021 capital program of 29 billion is allocated to the development program in the permian basin overall occidental plans to spend approximately 15 billion over the next five years to develop its proved undeveloped reserves in the permian basin 

at december 31 2020 occidental had 207 mmboe of pre2016 proved undeveloped reserves that remained undeveloped these proved undeveloped reserves relate to approved longterm development plans 187 mmboe of which are associated with international development projects with physical limitations in existing gas processing capacity and 20 mmboe associated with certain permian eor projects occidental remains committed to these projects and continues to actively progress the development of these volumes in addition to the above occidental has 89 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves that are scheduled to be developed more than five years from their initial date of booking these proved undeveloped reserves are primarily related to approved longterm development plans with physical limitations in existing gas processing capacity 51 mmboe of which are associated with other permian eor projects and 31 mmboe associated with international development projects 

reserves evaluation and review process 

occidental’s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of december 31 2020 were made by occidental’s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management the estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by occidental to develop the reserves this process involves reservoir engineers geoscientists planning engineers and financial analysts as part of the proved reserves estimation process all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates operating costs and capital expenditures price differentials between benchmark prices the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods including estimates from decline curve analysis type curve analysis material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance these reliable fieldtested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities 

net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor 

net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion proved undeveloped reserves are supported by a fiveyear detailed fieldlevel development plan which includes the timing location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled the development plan is reviewed and approved annually by senior management and technical personnel annually a detailed review is performed by occidental’s worldwide reserves group and its technical personnel on a leasebylease basis to assess whether proved undeveloped reserves are being converted on a timely basis within five years from the initial disclosure date any leases not showing timely transfers from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves are reviewed by senior management to determine if the remaining reserves will be developed in a timely manner and have sufficient capital committed in the development plan only proved undeveloped reserves that are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan a portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved longterm development plans

occidental has a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee consisting of senior corporate officers to review and approve occidental’s oil and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidental’s board of directors during the year since 2003 occidental has retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum engineering consultants to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes for additional reserves information see supplemental oil and gas information under item 8 of this form 10k 

in 2020 ryder scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of december 31 2020 in accordance with sec regulatory standards ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of occidental’s 2020 yearend total proved reserves portfolio in 2020 ryder scott reviewed approximately 30 of occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves since being engaged in 2003 ryder scott has reviewed the specific application of occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 87 of occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves 

management retained ryder scott to provide objective thirdparty input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by occidental occidental has filed ryder scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this form 10k 

based on its reviews including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current sec regulations 



business strategy 

oxychem seeks to be a lowcost producer in order to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve abovecostofcapital returns oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with the coproduction of caustic soda and chlorine caustic soda and chlorine are marketed to external customers in addition chlorine together with ethylene is converted through a series of intermediate products into pvc oxychem’s focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chloralkali and pvc businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities in 2020 capital expenditures for oxychem totaled 255 million 

business environment 

in 2020 the united states economic contraction estimated to be 35 was significantly lower than the 22 growth experienced in 2019 which resulted in lower demand for caustic soda and pvc pricing for pvc rebounded in the second half of 2020 and finished higher than the 2019 average due to increased domestic demand and lower supply caustic soda prices were lower in 2020 partially offset by lower ethylene and energy costs 

business review 

basic chemicals 

the us economic contraction due to the covid19 pandemic resulted in lower domestic demand as the industry chloralkali operating rates decreased by 8 compared to 2019 liquid caustic soda prices were lower both domestically and globally in 2020 due to weaker demand in the pulp and paper and industrial market segments which was partially offset by lower energy prices than in 2019 stronger chlorine derivative demand in relation to caustic soda resulted in persistent downward pressure on caustic soda pricing 

vinyls 

due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic and supply interruptions during a very active hurricane season industry demand for pvc in 2020 decreased yearoveryear by 4 resulting in 6 lower operating rates domestic demand was up 54 while export demand was down 22 from 2019 second half 2020 housing starts construction and home improvement markets were the main contributors for the strong rebound in domestic demand us domestic producers grappled with extended production outages resulting in lower pvc availability for export markets export volume 





represented 28 of total north american production industry pvc margins increased in 2020 due to a strong price environment driven by higher than expected demand and limited supply 

industry outlook 

industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy and the effectiveness of the vaccine rollouts continued recovery from 2020 should result in improvement in the housing construction automotive and durable goods markets the housing and construction as well as automotive markets are expected to strengthen over the next year margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices recovery in the petroleum industry should strengthen the demand and pricing of a number of occidental’s products that are consumed by industry participants us commodity export markets will continue to be impacted by the relative strength of the us dollar 

basic chemicals 

demand for basic chemicals is expected to improve in 2021 over 2020 levels improvement in most market segments is expected with improvement in the overall economy demand for chlorine and derivatives will improve with continued growth in the housing general construction and automotive markets demand for alkali products particularly caustic soda will improve with growth in the pulp and paper industrial and alumina markets chloralkali operating rates should improve moderately with higher demand and continued competitive energy and raw material pricing as compared to global feedstock costs 

vinyls 

domestic pvc demand is expected to improve in 2021 over 2020 levels growth in residential construction spending and expected new infrastructure projects is forecast to drive domestic growth in 2021 although overall pvc demand is expected to remain strong in north america operating rates are anticipated to remain relatively flat in 2021 as new pvc capacity is expected to enter the market in the second half of the year 



business strategy 

the midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing the use of its gathering processing transportation storage and terminal commitments and by providing access to domestic and international markets to generate returns the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to occidental’s subsidiaries as well as third parties the midstream and marketing segment operates or contracts for services on gathering systems gas plants cogeneration facilities and storage facilities and invests in entities that conduct similar activities as of december 31 2019 occidental began accounting for its ownership investment in wes under the equity method of accounting see note 16  investments and relatedparty transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for more information 

the midstream and marketing segment has equity investments in wes and dolphin energy limited wes owns gathering systems plants and pipelines and earns revenue from feebased and servicebased contracts with occidental and third parties dolphin energy limited owns and operates a pipeline which connects its gas processing and compression plant in qatar and its receiving facilities in uae and uses its network of dolphin energy limitedowned and other existing leased pipelines to supply natural gas across the uae and to oman also included in the midstream and marketing segment is olcv olcv seeks to leverage occidental’s carbon management expertise that is derived from its eor operations to develop carbon capture utilization and storage facilities that are expected to source anthropogenic co 2 and promote innovative technologies that drive cost efficiencies and economically grow occidental’s business while reducing emissions 

this segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas and power used in occidental’s various businesses capital is employed to sustain or expand assets to improve the competitiveness of occidental’s businesses in 2020 capital expenditures related to the midstream and marketing segment totaled 50 million 

business environment 

midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its various businesses including its marketing gathering and transportation gas processing and powergeneration assets the marketing business aggregates markets and stores occidental and thirdparty volumes marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs the marketing business results can experience significant volatility depending on commodity price changes and the midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads the midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads have decreased from an average of 658 per barrel in 2019 to 143 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2020 and averaging 059 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2020 a 025 change in the midlandtogulf coast oil spreads impacts total year operating cash flows by 65 million in 2020 permian to gulf coast transportation capacity increased as new thirdparty pipelines were completed this along with reduction in permian basin production reduced the midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads gas gathering processing and transportation results are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment’s plants as well 





as the margins obtained on related services from investments in which occidental has an equity interest the 2020 declines in ngl prices and sulfur prices negatively impacted the gas processing business 

business review 

marketing 

the marketing group markets substantially all of occidental’s oil ngl and natural gas production as well as trades around its assets including contracted transportation and storage capacity occidental’s thirdparty marketing activities focus on purchasing oil ngl and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets these purchases allow occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets in 2020 compared to the prior year marketing results were negatively impacted by the decline in the midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads 

pipeline 

occidental’s pipeline business mainly consists of its 245 ownership interest in dolphin energy limited dolphin energy limited owns and operates a 230milelong 48inchdiameter natural gas pipeline dolphin pipeline which transports dry natural gas from qatar to the uae and oman the dolphin pipeline has capacity to transport up to 32 bcfd and currently transports approximately 22 bcfd and up to 25 bcfd in the summer months 

gas processing gathering and co 2 

occidental processes its and thirdparty domestic wet gas to extract ngl and other gas byproducts including co 2 and delivers dry gas to pipelines margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for ngl 

as of december 31 2020 occidental has a 2 nonvoting general partner interest and a 518 limited partner interest in wes and a 2 nonvoting limited partner interest in wes operating a subsidiary of wes as of december 31 2020 on a combined basis occidentals total effective economic interest in wes and its subsidiaries is 535 occidental intends to reduce its limited partner ownership interest in wes to below 50 see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for more information regarding occidental’s equity method investment in wes wes owns gathering systems plants and pipelines and earns revenue from feebased and servicebased contracts with occidental and third parties 

occidental’s 40 participating interest in al hosn gas also includes sour gas processing facilities that are designed to process 13 bcfd of natural gas and separate it into salable gas condensate ngl and sulfur in 2020 the facilities produced 11300 tons per day of sulfur of which approximately 4500 tons per day was occidental’s net share 

in 2020 compared to the prior year gas processing gathering and co 2 results decreased primarily due to lower ngl prices and sulfur prices which negatively impacted the gas processing business 

power generation facilities 

earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties 

low carbon ventures 

olcv was formed to execute on occidental’s vision to reduce global emissions and provide a more sustainable future through low carbon energy and products olcv capitalizes on occidental’s extensive experience in utilizing co 2 for eor by investing in technologies developing projects and providing services to facilitate and accelerate the implementation of carbon capture utilization and storage projects and opportunities for zerocarbon power moreover olcv is fostering new technologies and business models with the potential to position occidental as a leader in the production of lowcarbon oil and products 

occidental has developed standards and protocols recognized by the epa for monitoring reporting and verifying the amount safety and permanence of co 2 stored through secure geologic sequestration the company holds the nation’s first two epaapproved monitoring reporting and verification plans for geologic sequestration through eor production 

industry outlook 

midstream and marketing segment results can experience volatility depending on the midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads and commodity price changes to a lesser extent declines in commodity prices including ngl and sulfur prices reduce the results for the gas processing business

the following table sets forth the average realized prices for oil ngl and natural gas from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2020 and includes a yearoveryear change calculation 







domestic oil and gas results excluding significant items affecting comparability decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower realized oil ngl and natural gas prices partially offset by higher crude oil ngl and natural gas sales volumes mostly due to additional production from the acquisition 

international oil and gas results excluding significant items affecting comparability decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in realized commodity prices as well as lower volumes as a result of exiting qatar in 2019 

production 

the following table sets forth the production volumes of oil ngl and natural gas per day from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2020 and includes a yearoveryear change calculation 



a natural gas volumes have been converted to boe based on energy content of six mcf of gas to one barrel of oil boe equivalent does not necessarily result in price equivalency please refer to the supplemental oil and gas information unaudited section of this form 10k for additional information on oil and gas production and sales 

average daily production volumes from ongoing operations increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a full year of production associated with the assets acquired from the acquisition 

lease operating expense 

the following table sets forth the average lease operating expense per boe from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2020 



average lease operating expense per boe decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to operational efficiencies related to downhole maintenance and supports 





chemical segment 



chemical segment results decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower realized caustic soda prices and overall lower sales volumes as a result of the covid19 pandemic partially offset by lower natural gas costs and lower plant spending 

midstream and marketing segment 



a results included items affecting comparability listed below 

b the 2020 amount represented a loss on the exchange of wes common units to retire a 260 million note the 2019 amount represented a 114 million gain on the sale of an equity investment in plains all american pipeline lp and plains gp holdings lp together plains the 2018 amount represented a gain on sale of noncore domestic midstream assets

d the 2019 amount represented a 30 million marktomarket gain on an interest rate swap for wes 

midstream and marketing segment results excluding items affecting comparability decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower marketing margins from the tightening of the average midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads by 515 per barrel and to a lesser extent lower pipeline income following the sale of the plains equity investment in the third quarter of 2019 and lower sulfur prices impacting al hosn gas 

corporate 

significant corporate items include the following 





total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance were 43 billion and 37 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets net of any allowances through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences the total deferred tax liabilities were 114 billion and 134 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease in net deferred tax liability in 2020 over 2019 is primarily driven by domestic asset impairments for which occidental does not receive an immediate tax benefit as well as an increase in net operating loss carryforwards 





worldwide effective tax rate 

the following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations 



in 2020 occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate was 14 which was largely a result of the impairment of the wes goodwill and certain international assets for which occidental receives no tax benefit and highertaxed foreign operations which generally caused occidental’s tax rate to vary significantly from the us corporate tax rate occidental’s effective tax rate is impacted each year by the relative pretax income loss earned by its domestic and international operations 



revenue and other income items 



price and volume changes generally represent the majority of the change in the oil and gas and chemical segments sales midstream and marketing sales are mainly impacted by the lower marketing margins from the decrease in the midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads and to a lesser extent the change in ngl and sulfur prices for the gas processing business 

the decrease in net sales in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower realized oil prices in the oil and gas segment despite higher volumes as a result of a full year of production from properties added in the acquisition and net gains on the threeway oil collars midstream and marketing sales declined due to tightening of the midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads chemical sales declined primarily due to lower sales volumes across all products and lower realized caustic soda prices 

the 2020 losses on sales of assets net is primarily comprised of 820 million related to the sale of certain noncore largely nonoperated acreage in the permian basin 440 million related to the sale of 45 million mineral acres and 1 million fee surface acres located in wyoming colorado and utah 353 million related to the sale of the colombia onshore assets and a loss of 46 million related to the wes note exchange 





expense items 



oil and gas operating expense 

oil and gas operating expense decreased in 2020 from the prior year primarily due to operational efficiencies that decreased downhole maintenance and workover and support costs and lower energy and purchased injectant costs 

transportation and gathering expense 

transportation and gathering expense increased in 2020 from the prior year primarily due to a full year of increased sales volumes related to the acquisition as well as transportation costs to wes which was previously a consolidated entity in 2019 

chemical and midstream cost of sales 

chemical and midstream cost of sales decreased in 2020 from the prior year primarily due to favorable raw material costs in the chemical segment and lower midstream operation costs due to the loss of control of wes in 2019 

purchased commodities 

purchased commodities decreased in 2020 largely as a result of lower crude oil prices on thirdparty crude purchases related to the midstream and marketing segment 

other operating and nonoperating expense 

other operating and nonoperating expense decreased in 2020 from the prior year primarily due to the realization of overhead savings and a net gain related to the settlement curtailment and special termination benefits on pension plans acquired in the acquisition 

depreciation depletion and amortization dda 

dda expense increased in 2020 from the prior year primarily due to having a full year of production in 2020 associated with assets acquired through the acquisition

in 2020 asset impairments and other charges included pretax impairments of 45 billion primarily related to domestic onshore unproved acreage as well as 13 billion primarily related to other domestic onshore assets and the gulf of mexico in addition there were 931 million of impairment and related charges associated with occidental’s proved properties in algeria to remeasure the algeria oil and gas properties to their fair value in addition for the midstream and marketing segment there were pretax impairment charges of 27 billion otherthantemporary impairment of the equity investment in wes and 12 billion of impairments related to the writeoff of goodwill 

taxes other than on income 

taxes other than on income in 2020 decreased from the prior year due to lower production taxes which are directly tied to prices on oil ngl and natural gas volumes 





acquisition related expenses 

acquisition related expenses in 2020 are associated with employee severance and related employee costs primarily related to onetime severance costs and the accelerated vesting of certain anadarko sharebased awards for former anadarko employees based on the terms of the acquisition and existing change of control provisions within the former anadarko employment agreements 

interest and debt expense net 

interest and debt expense net increased in 2020 from the prior year due to an increase in debt issued to partially fund the acquisition as well as the debt assumed through the acquisition 

other items 



gains losses on interest rate swaps and warrants 

gains losses on interest rate swaps and warrants are primarily due to a decline in the reference rate on the interest rate swaps throughout 2020 as fixed interest rates exceed the floating interest rates during the reference period 

income tax benefit expense 

occidental realized an income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to an income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to lower pretax income partially offset by the impairment of certain international assets as well as the equity method goodwill associated with the wes investment for which occidental received no tax benefit 

discontinued operations net 

discontinued operations net in 2020 is associated with the operations of ghana for which occidental continues to present as held for sale the decrease in income in 2020 is primarily associated with an aftertax impairment of 14 billion in the second quarter of 2020 to reflect the held for sale assets at their fair value less costs to sell based on the income approach 







cash on hand 

at december 31 2020 occidental had approximately 20 billion in cash and cash equivalents a substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the united states 

occidental’s 5 billion rcf available cash continued access to capital markets and positive operating cash flows will allow occidental to meet its short and longterm purchase obligations nearterm debt maturities and other liabilities 

at december 31 2020 occidental had 04 billion in current maturities of longterm debt through december 31 2021 and an additional 21 billion in longterm obligations due in 2022 other nearterm obligations include interest rate swaps with mandatory termination dates in september 2021 with a notional value of 750 million and accounts payable incurred in the course of occidental’s business activities 

occidental continues to pursue divestitures of certain assets and intends to use the net proceeds from asset sales and free cash flow to repay its nearerterm debt maturities but the expected timing and final proceeds from such asset sales are uncertain occidental currently expects its cash on hand to be sufficient to meet its debt maturities operating expenditures and other obligations for the next 12 months from the date of this filing however given the inherent uncertainty associated with the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic and its resulting impact on oil demand occidental may need to raise capital to fund its operations and refinance debt maturities 

at december 31 2020 occidental had 170 million in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents which was primarily associated with an international joint venture a benefits trust for former anadarko employees that was funded as part of the acquisition and a judicially controlled account related to a brazilian tax dispute restricted cash within the benefits trust will be made available to occidental as benefits are paid to former anadarko employees 

debt activity 

on march 23 2020 occidental amended the sole financial covenant in its rcf by revising the definition of total capitalization to exclude any noncash writedowns impairments and related charges occurring after september 30 2019 the amendments provide occidental with additional flexibility in the event of any such writedowns impairments or other changes under the ratio of total debt to total capitalization covenant 

in july august and december 2020 occidental issued several series of notes with maturities from five to ten years the proceeds from these issuances were used to tender and repay nearerterm notes and the term loan occidental used proceeds from the sale of mineral and surface acres located in wyoming colorado and utah the colombian asset sale and proceeds from other divestitures to repay debt occidental used the net proceeds from asset sales cash on hand and senior notes offerings to retire or tender 60 billion of 2021 27 billion of 2022 and 264 million of 2023 maturities 

in august 2020 occidental exchanged approximately 279 million wes common units to retire a 260 million note payable to wes

as of december 31 2020 under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on or acquisitions of occidental stock 

cash flow analysis 

cash provided by operating activities 



cash provided by operating activities decreased 34 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower oil prices as average wti and brent prices decreased by 31 and 33 respectively operating cash flows also decreased due to the decrease in the average midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads which decreased by 515 per barrel in 2020 compared to 2019 to a lesser extent the reduction in realized ngl and natural gas prices also impacted the lower operating cash flows in 2020 these decreases were partially offset by higher oil and gas sale volumes as 2020 had a full year of production from assets associated with the acquisition along with settlement of the threeway oil collars of 09 billion 





cash used by investing activities 



cash flows used by investing activities decreased by 282 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the 2019 acquisition additionally occidental reduced capital spending in 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic see note 4  divestitures and o ther tra nsactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for a listing of assets and equity investments sold in 2020 2019 and 2018 

cash provided used by financing activities 



cash provided by financing activities decreased by 267 billion compared to 2019 primarily due to the 2019 increase in debt used to fund the acquisition additionally common dividends paid in 2020 were lower than 2019 due to the board of directors’ decision to reduce the quarterly dividend rate effective as of july 2020 from 079 to 001 per share see note 7  longterm debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for more information related to occidental’s debt issuance and repayments

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes and crossreferences occidental’s contractual obligations and indicates on and offbalance sheet obligations as of december 31 2020 commitments related to held for sale assets are excluded

b occidental is the lessee under various agreements for real estate equipment plants and facilities see note 2  accounting and disclosure changes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k regarding the impact of rules effective january 1 2019 which required occidental to recognize most leases including operating leases on the balance sheet 

c includes long term obligations and current portions of long term obligations under postretirement benefit accrued transportation commitments ad valorem taxes and other accrued liabilities 

d amounts include payments which will become due under longterm agreements to purchase goods and services used in the normal course of business to secure terminal pipeline and processing capacity co 2 electrical power steam and certain chemical raw materials amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable longterm purchase contracts are discounted at a 441 discount rate 



legal matters 

occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property damage or other losses punitive damages civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar federal state local and foreign environmental laws these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties and injunctive relief usually occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies further some lawsuits claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction 

in accordance with applicable accounting guidance occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated reserves for matters other than for environmental remediation that satisfy this criteria as of december 31 2020 and 2019 were not material to occidental’s consolidated balance sheets 

in 2016 occidental received payments from the republic of ecuador of approximately 10 billion pursuant to a november 2015 arbitration award for ecuador’s 2006 expropriation of occidentals participation contract for block 15 the awarded amount represented a recovery of 60 of the value of block 15 in 2017 andes petroleum ecuador ltd andes filed a demand for arbitration claiming it is entitled to a 40 share of the judgment amount obtained by occidental occidental contends that andes is not entitled to any of the amounts paid under the 2015 arbitration award because occidental’s recovery was limited to occidental’s own 60 economic interest in the block the merits hearing occurred in september 2020 and an arbitration decision is expected within the next six months 

in august 2019 sanchez energy corporation and certain of its affiliates sanchez filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code sanchez is a party to agreements with anadarko as 





a result of its 2017 purchase of anadarkos eagle ford shale assets sanchez is attempting to reject some of the agreements related to the purchase of anadarko’s eagle ford shale assets if sanchez is permitted to reject certain of those agreements then anadarko may owe deficiency payments to various third parties occidental intends to defend vigorously any attempt by sanchez to reject the agreements occidental expects a ruling on sanchezs purported contract rejection in the first half of 2021 

on may 26 2020 a putative securities class action captioned city of sterling heights general employees’ retirement system et al v occidental petroleum corporation et al no 6519942020 city of sterling was filed in the supreme court of the state of new york the complaint asserts claims under sections 11 12 and 15 of the securities act of 1933 as amended the securities act based on alleged misstatements in the securities act filings including the registration statement filed in connection with the anadarko acquisition and occidental’s related issuance of common stock and debt securities offerings that took place in august 2019 the lawsuit was filed against occidental certain current and former officers and directors and certain underwriters of the debt securities offerings and seeks damages in an unspecified amount plus attorneys’ fees and expenses two additional putative class actions were filed in the same court together with city of sterling the state cases and the state cases were consolidated into in re occidental petroleum corporation securities litigation  no 6518302020 occidental intends to vigorously defend itself in all respects in regard to the state cases 

the ultimate outcome and impact of outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings on occidental cannot be predicted management believes that the resolution of these matters will not indivi dually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on occidentals consolidated balance sheets if unfavorable outcomes of these matters were to occur future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected occidental’s estimates are based on information known about the legal matters and its experience in contesting litigating and settling similar matters occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available 

tax matters 

during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax jurisdictions taxable years through 2017 for us federal income tax purposes have been audited by the us internal revenue service irs pursuant to its compliance assurance program and subsequent taxable years are currently under review taxable years through 2009 have been audited for state income tax purposes all other significant audit matters in foreign jurisdictions have been resolved through 2010 during the course of tax audits disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

for anadarko its taxable years through 2014 and tax year 2016 for us federal and state income tax purposes have been audited by the irs and respective state taxing authorities there are outstanding significant audit matters in one foreign jurisdiction as stated above during the course of tax audits disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law other than the matter discussed below occidental believes that the resolution of these outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

anadarko received an 881 million tentative refund in 2016 related to its 52 billion tronox adversary proceeding settlement payment in 2015 in september 2018 anadarko received a statutory notice of deficiency from the irs disallowing the net operating loss carryback and rejecting anadarko’s refund claim as a result anadarko filed a petition with the us tax court to dispute the disallowances in november 2018 the case was in the irs appeals process until the second quarter of 2020 however it has since been returned to the us tax court where occidental expects to continue pursuing resolution 

in accordance with asc 740’s guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions occidental has recorded no tax benefit on the tentative cash tax refund of 881 million as a result should occidental not ultimately prevail on the issue there would be no additional tax expense recorded relative to this position for financial statement purposes other than future interest however in that event occidental would be required to repay approximately 925 million 898 million federal and 27 million in state taxes plus accrued interest of approximately 255 million a liability for this amount plus interest is included in deferred credits and other liabilitiesother 

indemnities to third parties 

occidental its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2020 occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 







occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal state local and international laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality the laws that require or address environmental remediation including cercla and similar federal state local and international laws may apply retroactively and regardless of fault the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites occidental or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating closed and thirdparty sites remedial activities may include one or more of the following investigation involving sampling modeling risk assessment or monitoring cleanup measures including removal treatment or disposal or operation and maintenance of remedial systems the environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties injunctive relief and government oversight costs 

environmental remediation 

as of december 31 2020 occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 170 sites the following table presents occidental’s current and noncurrent environmental remediation liabilities as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities 123 million in 2020 and 162 million in 2019 and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities  environmental remediation liabilities 103 billion in 2020 and 104 billion in 2019 

occidental’s environmental remediation sites are grouped into four categories national priorities list npl sites listed or proposed for listing by the epa on the cercla npl and three categories of nonnpl sites — thirdparty sites occidentaloperated sites and closed or nonoperated occidental sites 



as of december 31 2020 occidental’s environmental liabilities exceeded 10 million each at 19 of the 170 sites described above and 96 of the sites had liabilities from 0 to 1 million each as of december 31 2020 two sites — the diamond alkali superfund site and a former chemical plant in ohio both of which are indemnified by maxus energy corporation as discussed further below — accounted for 92 of its liabilities associated with npl sites 17 of the 35 npl sites are indemnified by maxus 

five of the 69 thirdparty sites — a maxusindemnified chrome site in new jersey a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee a former oil field and a landfill in california and an active refinery in louisiana where occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities — accounted for 76 of occidental’s liabilities associated with these sites 9 of the 69 thirdparty sites are indemnified by maxus 

five sites — oil and gas operations in colorado and chemical plants in kansas louisiana new york and texas — accounted for 70 of the liabilities associated with the occidentaloperated sites seven other sites — a landfill in western new york a former refinery in oklahoma former chemical plants in california michigan tennessee and washington and a closed coal mine in pennsylvania — accounted for 70 of the liabilities associated with closed or nonoperated occidental sites 

environmental remediation liabilities vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or divestitures identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation occidental recorded environmental remediation expenses of 36 million 112 million and 47 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively environmental remediation expenses primarily relate to changes to existing conditions from past operations based on current estimates occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 45 of the yearend remediation balance over the next three to four years with the remainder over the subsequent 10 or more years occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those amounts currently recorded for environmental remediation for all of its environmental sites could be up to 11 billion 





maxus environmental sites 

when occidental acquired diamond shamrock chemicals company dscc in 1986 maxus agreed to indemnify occidental for a number of environmental sites including the diamond alkali superfund site site along a portion of the passaic river on june 17 2016 maxus and several affiliated companies filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal district court in the state of delaware prior to filing for bankruptcy maxus defended and indemnified occidental in connection with cleanup and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity including the site 

in march 2016 the epa issued a record of decision rod specifying remedial actions required for the lower 83 miles of the lower passaic river the rod does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river or newark bay during the third quarter of 2016 and following maxus’s bankruptcy filing occidental and the epa entered into an administrative order on consent aoc to complete the design of the proposed cleanup plan outlined in the rod at an estimated cost of 165 million the epa announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties 

occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and remediation called for in the aoc and the rod as well as for certain other maxusindemnified sites occidentals accrued estimated environmental reserve does not consider any recoveries for indemnified costs occidental’s ultimate share of this liability may be higher or lower than the reserved amount and is subject to final design plans and the resolution of occidentals allocable share with other potentially responsible parties occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the aoc the rod and to perform remediation at other maxusindemnified sites in light of the maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties in june 2018 occidental filed a complaint under cercla in federal district court in the state of new jersey against numerous potentially responsible parties for reimbursement of amounts incurred or to be incurred to comply with the aoc the rod or to perform other remediation activities at the site 

in june 2017 the court overseeing the maxus bankruptcy approved a plan of liquidation plan to liquidate maxus and create a trust to pursue claims against current and former parents ypf and each of its respective subsidiaries and affiliates ypf and repsol sa and each of its respective subsidiaries and affiliates repsol as well as others to satisfy claims by occidental and other creditors for past and future cleanup and other costs in july 2017 the courtapproved plan became final and the trust became effective the trust is pursuing claims against ypf repsol and others and is expected to distribute assets to maxus creditors in accordance with the trust agreement and plan in june 2018 the trust filed its complaint against ypf and repsol in delaware bankruptcy court asserting claims based upon among other things fraudulent transfer and alter ego during 2019 the bankruptcy court denied repsols and ypfs motions to dismiss the complaint as well as their motions to move the case away from the bankruptcy court discovery remains ongoing at the time of this report 

environmental costs 

occidental’s environmental costs some of which include estimates are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended december 31 



operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures relate to longerlived improvements in properties currently operated by occidental remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations 







a portion of occidental’s assets are located outside north america the following table shows the geographic distribution of occidental’s assets at december 31 2020 at both the segment and consolidated level related to occidental’s ongoing operations 



for the year ended december 31 2020 net sales outside north america totaled 34 billion or approximately 19 of total net sales 



the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires occidental’s management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts the selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management’s judgment 

oil and gas properties 

the carrying value of occidental’s property plant and equipment ppe represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset including any asset retirement obligations aros and capitalized interest net of dda and any impairment charges for assets acquired in a business combination ppe cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets 

occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found if proved reserves have been found the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory drilling costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the economic and operating viability of the project at the end of each quarter management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities in particular whether occidental is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed 

occidental expenses annual lease rentals the costs of injectants used in production and geological and geophysical costs as incurred for exploration activities 

occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unitofproduction method it amortizes leasehold acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain 





regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 

several factors could change occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves for example occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline generally occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices in other cases particularly with longlived properties lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical for such properties higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidental’s control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded changes in the political and regulatory climate could lead to decreases in proved reserves as development horizons may be extended into the future 

occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable if there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to significant and prolonged declines in current and forward prices significant changes in reserve estimates changes in management’s plans or other significant events management will evaluate the property for impairment under the successful efforts method if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants the impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time these assumptions include estimates of future production product prices contractual prices estimates of riskadjusted oil and gas proved and unproved reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs it is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in additional impairments 

for impairment testing unless prices are contractually fixed occidental uses observable forward strip prices for oil and natural gas prices when projecting future cash flows future operating and development costs are estimated using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce oil and gas reserves market prices for oil ngl and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future changes in global supply and demand transportation capacity currency exchange rates applicable laws and regulations and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions could impact current forecasts future fluctuations in commodity prices could result in estimates of future cash flows to vary significantly 

net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were 186 billion at december 31 2020 and 295 billion at december 31 2019 the unproved amounts are not subject to dda until they are classified as proved properties individually insignificant unproved properties are combined and amortized on a group basis based on factors such as lease terms success rates and other factors to provide for full amortization upon lease expiration or abandonment 

significant unproved properties primarily as a result of the acquisition are assessed individually for impairment and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recovered a valuation allowance is provided if an impairment is indicated occidental periodically reviews significant unproved properties for impairments numerous factors are considered including but not limited to availability of funds for future exploration and development activities current exploration and development plans favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property or the adjacent property geologists’ evaluation of the property the current and projected political and regulatory climate contractual conditions and the remaining lease term for the properties if an impairment is indicated occidental will first determine whether a comparable transaction for similar properties or implied acreage valuation derived from domestic onshore market participants is available and will adjust the carrying amount of the unproved property to its fair value using the market approach in situations where the market approach is not observable and unproved reserves are available undiscounted future net cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based on managements’ risk adjusted estimates of unproved reserves future commodity prices and future costs to produce the reserves if undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property the future net cash flows are discounted and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record occidental utilizes the same assumptions and methodology discussed above for cash flows associated with proved properties 





proved reserves 

occidental estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the sec and financial accounting standards board this definition includes oil ngl and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods government regulations etc at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions for reserves information see the supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities under item 8 of this form 10k 

engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information occidental’s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons these estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised either upward or downward as warranted by additional data revisions are necessary due to changes in among other things development plans reservoir performance prices economic conditions and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date a material adverse change in the estimated volume of proved reserves could have a negative impact on dda and could result in property impairments 

the most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in occidental’s oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the dda rate for example a 5 increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the dda rate by approximately 080bbl which would increase or decrease pretax income by approximately 330 million annually at current production rates 

fair values 

occidental estimates fairvalue of longlived assets for impairment testing assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in nonmonetary transactions pension plan assets and initial measurements of aros 

accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value 

occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs when estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed occidental must apply various assumptions 

financial assets and liabilities 

occidental utilizes the midpoint between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its financial assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value in addition to using market data occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value occidental measures fair value using the following methods 

■ occidental values exchangecleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date these derivatives are classified as using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities level 1 

■ overthecounter otc bilateral financial commodity contracts international exchange contracts options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industrystandard models that consider various inputs including quoted forward prices for commodities time value volatility factors credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments as well as other relevant economic measures substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 

■ occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves the assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as using unobservable inputs level 3 within the valuation hierarchy 

■ occidental values debt using marketobservable information for debt instruments that are traded on secondary markets for debt instruments that are not traded the fair value is determined by interpolating the value based on debt with similar terms and credit risk 





nonfinancial assets 

occidental uses marketobservable prices for assets when comparable transactions can be identified that are similar to the asset being valued when occidental is required to measure fair value and there is not a marketobservable price for the asset or for a similar asset then the cost or income approach is used depending on the quality of information available to support management’s assumptions the cost approach is based on management’s best estimate of the current asset replacement cost the income approach is based on management’s best assumptions regarding expectations of future net cash flows and the expected cash flows are discounted using a commensurate riskadjusted discount rate such evaluations involve significant judgment the results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput development and operating costs and the timing thereof economic and regulatory climates and other factors most of which are often outside of management’s control however assumptions used reflect a market participant’s view of longterm prices costs and other factors and are consistent with assumptions used in occidental’s business plans and investment decisions 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate occidental records environmental liabilities and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the environmental remediation liability and the range of reasonably possible additional losses occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience remedial objectives available technologies applicable laws and regulations and costsharing arrangements occidental bases its environmental remediation liabilities on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred using the most costeffective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective occidental periodically reviews its environmental remediation liabilities and adjusts them as new information becomes available occidental records environmental remediation liabilities on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established the reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established presently none of its environmental remediation liabilities are recorded on a discounted basis occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received or when receipt of recovery is highly probable 

many factors could affect occidental’s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental remediation liabilities and the range of reasonably possible additional losses the most significant are 1 cost estimates for remedial activities may vary from the initial estimate 2 the length of time type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination 3 a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify occidental’s proposed remedial plan 4 improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs 5 laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability and 6 changes in allocation or costsharing arrangements may occur 

certain sites involve multiple parties with various costsharing arrangements which fall into the following three categories 1 environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties 2 oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest or 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of properties in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs in these circumstances occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate when estimating occidental’s ultimate share of liability occidental records its environmental remediation liabilities at its expected net cost of remedial activities and based on these factors believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved 

in addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures which often take in excess of 10 years at cercla npl sites occidental’s environmental remediation liabilities include management’s estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and adjusts its environmental remediation liabilities accordingly 

if occidental were to adjust the balance of its environmental remediation liabilities based on the factors described above the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings for example if the balance were reduced by 10 occidental would record a pretax gain of 115 million if the balance were increased by 10 occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 115 million 

income taxes 

occidental files various us federal state and foreign income tax returns the impact of changes in tax regulations are reflected when enacted in general deferred federal state and foreign income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis occidental routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets if occidental concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the 





deferred tax assets will not be realized the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance occidental recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefit recorded is equal to the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized through final settlement with a taxing authority interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense benefit occidental uses the flowthrough method to account for its investment tax credits see note 12  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

loss contingencies 

occidental is involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings and audits occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis 

loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate management’s judgments could change based on new information changes in or interpretations of laws or regulations changes in management’s plans or intentions opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings or other factors see note 11  lawsuits claims commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information

portions of this report contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended all statements other than statements of historical fact are “forwardlooking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws and they include but are not limited to any projections of earnings revenue or other financial items or future financial position or sources of financing any statements of the plans strategies and objectives of management for future operations or business strategy any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance any statements of belief and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing words such as “estimate” “project” “predict” “will” “would” “should” “could” “may” “might” “anticipate” “plan” “intend” “believe” “expect” “aim” “goal” “target” “objective” “likely” or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes are generally indicative of forwardlooking statements you should not place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date of this report unless legally required occidental does not undertake any obligation to update modify or withdraw any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

although occidental believes that the expectations reflected in any of its forwardlooking statements are reasonable actual results may differ from anticipated results sometimes materially factors that could cause results to differ from those projected or assumed in any forwardlooking statement include but are not limited to the scope and duration of the covid19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic occidental’s indebtedness and other payment obligations including the need to generate sufficient cash flows to fund operations occidental’s ability to successfully monetize select assets repay or refinance debt and the impact of changes in occidental’s credit ratings assumptions about energy markets global and local commodity and commodityfutures pricing fluctuations such as the sharp decline in crude oil prices that occurred in the first half of 2020 supply and demand considerations for and the prices of occidental’s products and services actions by opec and nonopec oil producing countries results from operations and competitive conditions future impairments of our proved and unproved oil and gas properties or equity investments or writedowns of productive assets causing charges to earnings unexpected changes in costs availability of capital resources levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations the regulatory approval environment including occidentals ability to timely obtain or maintain permits or other governmental approvals including those necessary for drilling andor development projects occidentals ability to successfully complete or any material delay of field developments expansion projects capital expenditures efficiency projects acquisitions or dispositions risks associated with acquisitions mergers and joint ventures such as difficulties integrating businesses uncertainty associated with financial projections projected synergies restructuring increased costs and adverse tax consequences uncertainties and liabilities associated with acquired and divested properties and businesses uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil ngl and natural gas reserves lowerthanexpected production from development projects or acquisitions

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 



general 

occidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil ngl and natural gas prices price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect occidental’s pretax annual income by approximately 200 million for a 1 per barrel change in oil prices and 85 million for a 1 per barrel change in ngl prices if domestic natural gas prices varied by 010 per mcf it would have an estimated annual effect on occidental’s pretax income of approximately 35 million these pricechange sensitivities include the impact of psc and similar contract volume changes on income if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidental’s results to prices also will change marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil natural gas and to a lesser degree other commodities a 025 change in the midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads impacts total year operating cash flows by 65 million 

occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices a variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of 10 per ton would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 10 million and 30 million respectively a variation in pvc prices of 001 per lb would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 30 million historically over time product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins 

occidental uses derivative instruments including a combination of shortterm futures forwards options and swaps to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas 

risk management 

occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies the controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check members of the risk management group report to the corporate vice president and treasurer controls for these activities include limits on value at risk limits on credit limits on total notional trade value segregation of duties delegation of authority daily price verifications reporting to senior management on various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls 

fair value of marketing derivative contracts 

occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value fair values for these contracts are derived from level 1 and level 2 sources the fair values in future maturity periods are insignificant 





the following table shows the fair value of occidental’s derivatives excluding collateral segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation 



quantitative information 

occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities this measure determines the maximum potential negative one day change in fair value with a 95 level of confidence additionally occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice as a result of these controls occidental believes that the market risk of its trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance 



general 

occidental acquired interest rate swap contracts in the acquisition occidental pays a fixed interest rate and receives a floating interest rate indexed to threemonth libor the swaps have an initial term of 30 years with mandatory termination dates in september 2021 through 2023 and a total notional amount of approximately 15 billion as of december 31 2020 as of december 31 2020 occidental had a net liability of approximately 14 billion based on the fair value of the swaps of negative 18 billion netted against 374 million in posted cash collateral a 25basis point decrease in implied libor rates over the term of the swaps would result in an additional liability of approximately 173 million on these swaps 

as of december 31 2020 occidental had variable rate debt with a notional value of 11 billion outstanding a 25basis point increase in libor interest rates would increase gross interest expense approximately 3 million per year 

as of december 31 2020 occidental had fixed rate debt with a fair value of 327 billion outstanding a 25basis point change in treasury rates would change the fair value of the fixed rate debt approximately 600 million 

tabular presentation of interest rate risk 

the table below provides information about occidental’s longterm debt obligations debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date 



a excluded net unamortized debt premiums of 748 million and debt issuance cost of 156 million 



occidental’s international operations have limited currency risk occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes a vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in united states dollars additionally all of occidental’s consolidated 





international oil and gas subsidiaries have the united states dollar as the functional currency as of december 31 2020 the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the marketing operations was immaterial the effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income 



the majority of occidental’s counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and any inability of these customers to meet their settlement commitments occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants as appropriate occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits occidental also enters into futures contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis 

certain otc derivative instruments contain creditriskcontingent features primarily tied to credit ratings for occidental or its counterparties which may affect the amount of collateral that each party would need to post the fair value of derivative instruments with creditriskcontingent features that were net liabilities at december 31 2020 was 104 million net of 374 million collateral and 787 million net of 169 million collateral at december 31 2019 creditriskcontingent features are primarily related to interest rate swaps 

as of december 31 2020 the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties occidental believes its exposure to creditrelated losses at december 31 2020 was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented 



as of december 31 2020 occidental had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future oil production of 350mbbld as of december 31 2020 these derivative instruments were at a 42 million net derivative liability position 

the following table shows a sensitivity analysis based on both a 5 and 10 change in commodity prices and their effect on the net derivative liability position of 42 million at december 31 2020 



as of december 31 2020 occidental had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future gas production of 530 thousand mmbtud as of december 31 2020 these derivative instruments were at a 25 million net derivative asset position 

the following table shows a sensitivity analysis based on both a 5 and 10 change in commodity prices and their effect on the net derivative asset position of 25 million at december 31 2020 










 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

occidental had no changes in and no disagreements with occidental’s accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 




 item 9a controls and procedures 



the management of occidental petroleum corporation and its subsidiaries occidental is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting occidental’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles occidental’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and divestitures of occidental’s assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that occidental’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of occidental’s management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of occidental’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management has assessed the effectiveness of occidental’s internal control system as of december 31 2020 based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control  integrated framework issued in 2013 by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management believes that as of december 31 2020 occidental’s system of internal control over financial reporting is effective 

occidental’s independent auditors kpmg llp have issued an audit report on occidental’s internal control over financial reporting 



occidental’s president and chief executive officer and its senior vice president and chief financial officer supervised and participated in occidental’s evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation occidental’s president and chief executive officer and senior vice president and chief financial officer concluded that occidental’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2020 

there has been no change in occidental’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act during the fourth quarter of 2020 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect occidental’s internal control over financial reporting the report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting is set forth in item 8

risk factors 

tableend risks related to occidental’s business and operations 

  

volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products particularly oil and to a lesser extent natural gas and ngl and its chemical products 

prices for oil natural gas and ngl fluctuate widely historically the markets for oil natural gas and ngl have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future if the prices of oil natural gas or ngl continue to be volatile or decline occidental’s operations financial condition cash flows level of expenditures and the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties may be materially and adversely affected prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in occidental’s control these factors include among others 

 

the longterm effects of these and other conditions on the prices of oil natural gas ngl and refined products are uncertain and there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for occidental’s products will follow historic patterns or recover meaningfully in the near term prolonged or substantial decline or sustained market uncertainty in these commodity prices may have the following effects on occidental’s business 

 

generally occidental’s historical practice has been to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities in 2019 management elected to hedge a portion of occidental’s expected 2020 oil production to enhance cash flow stability following the acquisition in the future management may elect to hedge some of the risk of oil natural gas and ngl price fluctuations past or future commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to regulatory and other risks 

the prices obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate to the health of the united states and global economies as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 





occidental may experience delays cost overruns losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities 

  

oil natural gas and ngl exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil natural gas and ngl production in its development and exploration activities occidental bears the risks of 

  

   

exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses 

  

governmental actions and political instability may affect occidental’s results of operations 

  

occidental’s businesses are subject to the actions and decisions of many federal state local and foreign governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 

  

   

as an example of local governmental actions some counties in colorado have amended their land use regulations to impose new requirements on oil and gas development while other local governments have entered memoranda of agreement with oil and gas producers to accomplish the same objective further voters in colorado have proposed or advanced ballot initiatives restricting or banning oil and gas development in colorado in the event that these ballot initiatives are adopted or the countylevel regulations are implemented in areas where we conduct operations we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration development or production activities 

in addition occidental has and may continue to experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability nationalizations corruption armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources 

  

occidental’s oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves 

  

results of operations reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend in part on occidental’s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves occidental has many competitors including national oil companies some of which i are larger and better funded ii may be willing to accept greater risks iii have greater access to capital iv have substantially larger staffs or v have special competencies competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts further during periods of low product prices any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts also there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry our failure to acquire properties grow production replace reserves and attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 





in addition occidental’s acquisition activities carry risks that it may i not fully realize anticipated benefits due to lessthanexpected reserves or production or changed circumstances such as declines in oil ngl and natural gas prices ii bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties iii experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity or iv be subject to liabilities that are greater than anticipated 

  

occidental’s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

  

reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability including production decline rates operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices future operating costs and capital expenditures workover and remedial costs assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies the quantity quality and interpretation of relevant data taxes and availability of funds the procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants however there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves actual production revenues expenditures oil ngl and natural gas prices and taxes with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates and the variance may be material if occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected 

in addition the discounted cash flows included in this form 10k should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted 12month average firstdayofthemonth prices in accordance with sec regulations actual future prices and costs may differ materially from sec regulationcompliant prices and costs used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves also actual future net cash flows may differ from these discounted net cash flows due to the amount and timing of actual production availability of financing for capital expenditures necessary to develop our undeveloped reserves supply and demand for oil ngl and natural gas increases or decreases in consumption of oil natural gas and ngl and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 

  

climate change and further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may adversely affect occidental’s operations or results 

  

continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional and local legislation and regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in december 2009 the environmental protection agency epa determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are according to the epa contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes based on these findings the epa began adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the clean air act caa for example the epa issued rules restricting methane emissions from hydraulically fractured and refractured gas wells compressors pneumatic controls storage vessels and natural gas processing plants in addition in august 2019 the epa issued the affordable clean energy rule that designates heat rate improvement or efficiency improvement as the best system of emissions reduction for carbon dioxide from existing coalfired electric utility generating units 

in the absence of federal legislation to significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to date many state governments have established rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions including greenhouse gas cap and trade programs most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels including refineries and natural gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in the future the united states may also choose to adhere to international agreements targeting greenhouse gas reductions these and other government actions relating to greenhouse gas emissions could require occidental to incur increased operating and maintenance costs such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems to acquire emissions allowances pay carbon taxes or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for oil natural gas ngl and other products that occidental’s businesses produce any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming and thereby reduce demand for oil natural gas ngl and other products produced by occidental’s businesses and lower the value of its reserves consequently government actions designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on occidental’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows and reserves 

it is difficult to predict the timing and certainty of such government actions and their ultimate effect on occidental which could depend on among other things the type and extent of greenhouse gas reductions required the availability and price of emissions allowances or credits the availability and price of alternative fuel sources the energy sectors covered and occidental’s ability to recover the costs incurred through its operating agreements or the pricing of its oil natural gas ngl and other products 

there also have been efforts in the investment community including investment advisers and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds as well as other stakeholders promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities operations and ability to access capital such initiatives could cause the market value of our securities to decrease our cost of capital to 





increase and adversely affect our reputation finally increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against occidental without regard to causation or our contribution to the asserted damage which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business occidental has been named in certain private litigation relating to these matters 

  

occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic events 

  

the occurrence of events such as hurricanes floods droughts earthquakes or other acts of nature well blowouts pandemics fires explosions pipeline ruptures chemical releases oil releases including maritime releases releases into navigable waters and groundwater contamination material or mechanical failure industrial accidents physical attacks abnormally pressured or structured formations and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates coastal operations are particularly susceptible to disruption from extreme weather events any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of 

  

   

thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses in addition under certain circumstances we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of properties that we own lease or operate as a result we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities for environmental matters for which we do not have insurance coverage which could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration development or acquisitions or cause us to incur losses 

  

occidental uses co 2 for its enhanced oil recovery eor operations and its production from these operations may decline if occidental is not able to obtain sufficient amounts of co 2  

  

occidental’s co 2   eor operations are critical to occidental’s longterm strategy oil production from occidental’s eor projects depends largely on having access to sufficient amounts of naturally occurring or anthropogenic co 2  occidental’s ability to produce oil from its eor projects would be hindered if the supply of co 2 was limited due to among other things problems with current co 2 producing wells and facilities including compression equipment catastrophic pipeline failure or the ability to economically purchase naturally occurring or anthropogenic co 2  this could have a material adverse effect on occidental’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows future oil production from its eor operations is dependent on the timing volumes and location of co 2 injections and in particular occidental’s ability to obtain sufficient volumes of co 2  market conditions may cause the delay or cancellation of the development of naturally occurring co 2 sources or construction of plants that produce anthropogenic co 2 as a byproduct that can be purchased thus limiting the amount of co 2 available for use in occidental’s eor operations 

  

occidental is exposed to cyberrelated risks 

  

the oil and gas industry is increasingly dependent on digital and industrial control technologies to conduct certain exploration development and production activities occidental relies on digital and industrial control systems related infrastructure technologies and networks to run its business and to control and manage its oil and gas chemicals marketing and pipeline operations use of the internet cloud services mobile communication systems and other public networks exposes occidental’s business and that of other third parties with whom occidental does business to cyberattacks cyberattacks on businesses have escalated in recent years 

information and industrial control technology system failures network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results resulting in the unintentional disclosure of company partner customer or employee information or could damage our reputation a cyberattack involving our information or industrial control systems and related infrastructure or that of our business associates could negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways including but not limited to the following 

  







   

even though occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of a cyberattack that it believes are reasonable there can be no assurance that such cyber security measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches of its systems from occurring and if a breach occurs it may remain undetected for an extended period of time further occidental has no control over the comparable systems of the third parties with whom it does business while occidental has experienced cyberattacks in the past occidental has not suffered any material losses however if in the future occidental’s cyber security measures are compromised or prove insufficient the potential consequences to occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant as cyberattacks continue to evolve in magnitude and sophistication occidental may be required to expend additional resources in order to continue to enhance occidental’s cyber security measures and to investigate and remediate any digital and operational systems related infrastructure technologies and network security vulnerabilities which would increase our costs a system failure or data security breach or a series of such failures or breaches could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

occidental’s oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect occidental’s business 

  

producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors unless occidental conducts successful exploration or development activities acquires properties containing proved reserves or both proved reserves will generally decline and negatively impact our business the value of our securities and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace reserves that are depleted by production or replace our declining production with new production management expects improved recovery extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors such as geology government regulations and permits the effectiveness of development plans and the ability to make the necessary capital investments or acquire capital are partially or fully outside management’s control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations 

  

occidental’s commodityprice risk management may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to regulatory and other risks 

  

to the extent that we engage in activities to protect occidental’s cash flows from commodityprice declines we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk in addition occidental’s commodityprice risk management may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which the following occur 

  







occidental’s operations and financial results could be significantly negatively impacted by its offshore operations 

  

occidental is vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our operations and financial results occidental conducts offshore operations in the gulf of mexico and ghana occidental’s operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by conditions in some of these areas and are also vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore including those relating to the following 

  

Ø hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions 

Ø geological complexities and water depths associated with such operations 

Ø limited number of partners available to participate in projects 

Ø oilfield service costs and availability 

Ø compliance with environmental safety and other laws and regulations 

Ø terrorist attacks or piracy 

Ø remediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials 

Ø failure of equipment or facilities and 

Ø response capabilities for personnel equipment or environmental incidents 

  

in addition occidental conducts some of its exploration in deep waters greater than 1000 feet where operations support services and decommissioning activities are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters the deep waters in the gulf of mexico as well as international deepwater locations lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters as a result deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and the time that occidental can market its production thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations 

  

additional domestic and international deepwater drilling laws regulations and other restrictions delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration development oil spill response and decommissioning plans and other offshorerelated developments may have a material adverse effect on occidental’s business financial condition or results of operations 

  

the bureau of ocean energy management boem and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement have imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters in addition these governmental agencies are continuing to evaluate develop and implement new more restrictive regulatory requirements which could result in additional costs delays restrictions or obligations with respect to oil exploration and production operations conducted offshore for example the boem has considered and may adopt supplemental bonding procedures for the decommissioning of offshore wells platforms pipelines and other facilities which may be material compliance with these more stringent regulatory requirements and with existing environmental and oil spill regulations together with any uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits or exploration development oil spillresponse and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts 

  

occidental’s indebtedness may make it more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in its business a downgrade in occidental’s credit ratings or future increases in interest rates may negatively impact occidental’s cost of and ability to access the capital markets 

  

occidental incurred indebtedness and other payment obligations in connection with the acquisition occidental’s higher level of indebtedness could increase occidental’s vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions economic downturns and adverse developments in its business andor limit occidental’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and the industries in which it operates from time to time occidental has relied on access to the capital markets for funding including in connection with the acquisition there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to occidental in the future on acceptable terms or at all occidental’s ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing will be subject to a number of factors including general economic and market conditions occidental’s performance investor sentiment and its existing debt compliance requirements if occidental is unable to generate sufficient funds from its operations to satisfy its capital requirements including its existing debt obligations or to raise additional capital on acceptable terms occidental’s business could be adversely affected in addition a downgrade in the credit rating of occidental could negatively impact its cost of and ability to access capital and to effectively execute aspects of its strategy and may require occidental to provide collateral letters of credit or other forms of security under certain contractual agreements which would increase occidental’s operating costs as a result a downgrade below investment grade in occidental’s credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on occidental’s financial condition operating results or liquidity 

further a portion of occidental’s indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates some of which is tied to the london interbank offered rate “libor” libor tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates rates set by the federal reserve and other central banks the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market and general economic conditions in july 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks 





to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee is considering replacing us dollar libor with a newly created index calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities it is not possible to predict the effect of these changes other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but may include an increase in the cost of occidental’s variable rate indebtedness including floating rate notes and interest rate swaps which may have an adverse effect on occidental’s financial condition operating results or cash flows 

  

risks related to occidental’s acquisition of anadarko 

  

occidental may not be able to integrate anadarko successfully and many of the anticipated benefits of combining occidental and anadarko may not be realized 

  

occidental acquired anadarko with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits including among other things operating efficiencies achieving those anticipated benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties including whether occidental can integrate the business of anadarko in an efficient and effective manner occidental cannot ensure that those benefits will be realized as quickly as expected or at all if occidental does not achieve anticipated benefits costs could increase expected net income could decrease the stock price could decline and future business financial condition operating results and prospects could suffer 

the integration process could take longer than anticipated and involve unanticipated costs disruptions of each company’s ongoing businesses processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures practices policies and compensation arrangements could adversely affect the combined company occidental may also have difficulty addressing differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and harmonizing other systems and business practices although occidental expects that the elimination of certain duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will over time offset the substantial incremental transaction and acquisitionrelated costs occidental may not achieve this net benefit in the near term or at all 

moreover even if the integration of anadarko is successful the integration process places a significant burden on occidental’s management and internal resources the diversion of management’s attention away from daytoday business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the integration process could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

future results will be negatively impacted if occidental does not effectively manage its expanded operations 

  

with completion of the acquisition the size of occidental’s business has increased significantly occidental’s continued success depends in part upon its ability to manage this expanded business which poses substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity occidental cannot assure that it will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits from the combination currently anticipated 

  

anadarko’s tronox settlement may not be deductible for income tax purposes and occidental may be required to repay the tax refund anadarko received in 2016 related to the deduction of the tronox settlement payment which may have a material adverse effect on occidental’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

  

in april 2014 anadarko and kerrmcgee corporation and certain of its subsidiaries collectively kerrmcgee entered into a settlement agreement for 515 billion resolving all claims that were or could have been asserted in connection with the may 2009 lawsuit filed by tronox against anadarko and kerrmcgee corporation and certain of its subsidiaries in the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york after the settlement became effective in january 2015 anadarko paid 52 billion and deducted this payment on its 2015 federal income tax return due to the deduction anadarko had a net operating loss carryback for 2015 which resulted in a tentative tax refund of 881 million in 2016 occidental’s consolidated financial statements include an uncertain tax position greater than the amount of the tentative tax refund received 

the irs has audited anadarko’s tax position regarding the deductibility of the payment and in september 2018 issued a statutory notice of deficiency rejecting anadarko’s refund claim anadarko disagreed and filed a petition with the us tax court to dispute the disallowance in november 2018 it is possible that occidental may not ultimately succeed in defending this deduction if the payment is ultimately determined not to be deductible occidental would be required to repay the tentative refund received plus interest totaling approximately 11 billion as of december 31 2019 which could have a material adverse effect on our statement of operations liquidity and consolidated balance sheets this amount is not covered by insurance for additional information on income taxes see note 11  lawsuits claims commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  





occidental may not be able to complete its planned divestitures of certain assets on favorable terms or at all 

occidental announced a 15 billion divestiture program in connection with the acquisition the completion of these divestitures is subject to customary closing conditions and certain of the divestitures are conditioned on the receipt of required government and regulatory approvals occidental may not be able to complete its planned divestitures on favorable terms in a timely manner or at all any difficulties with respect to the completion of the planned divestitures could have a material adverse effect on occidental’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor stock price see note 4  acquisitions dispositions and other transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for information about the total transaction

general 

occidental is focused on delivering a unique shareholder value proposition through continual enhancements to its asset quality organizational capability and innovative technical applications that provide competitive advantages occidental’s integrated business provides conventional and unconventional opportunities through which to grow value occidental aims to maximize shareholder returns through a combination of 

 occidental conducts its operations with a focus on sustainability health safety and environmental and social responsibility capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner price volatility is inherent in the oil and gas business and occidental’s strategy is to position the business to thrive in an up or downcycle commodity price environment 

on august 8 2019 occidental closed on its acquisition of anadarko the acquisition added to occidental’s oil and gas portfolio primarily in the permian basin dj basin and gulf of mexico as well as a significant economic interest in wes postacquisition occidental’s diversified portfolio provides numerous competitive advantages occidental is now the largest oil and gas leaseholder in the united states on a net acreage basis with ample opportunities in the permian basin dj basin powder river basin and the gulf of mexico with the ability to selectively deploy capital in a way that optimizes capital intensity as the acquired assets are integrated and developed occidental will utilize its subsurface and operating expertise to improve productivity and reduce full cycle costs 

key performance indicators 

occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success against key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return in addition to efficient capital allocation and deployment discussed below occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics 

   



business strategy 

occidental’s oil and gas segment focuses on longterm value creation and leadership in sustainability health safety and the environment in each core operating area occidental’s operations benefit from scale technical expertise decades of highmargin inventory environmental and safety leadership and commercial and governmental collaboration these attributes allow occidental to bring additional production quickly to market extend the life of older fields at lower costs and provide lowcost returnsdriven growth opportunities with advanced technology 

with the completion of the acquisition occidental became the largest us producer of oil and liquids in the second half of 2019 allowing occidental to maximize cash margins on a boe basis through the acquisition occidental acquired modern 3d seismic data pertaining to approximately 450000 square miles of core domestic development areas this resulted in a 40 increase in occidental’s permian seismic inventory the advantages that occidental’s diversified portfolio provides coupled with unmatched subsurface characterization ability and the proven ability to execute ensures that occidental is positioned for fullcycle success in the years ahead the oil and gas segment continues to focus on integration of the newly acquired assets and efforts to realize synergies at an early stage to deliver lower breakeven costs and generate excess free cash flow 





as a result of occidental’s strategic positioning occidental’s assets provide current production and a future portfolio of projects that are flexible and have shortcycle investment paybacks together with occidental’s technical capabilities the oil and gas segment strives to achieve low development and operating costs to maximize fullcycle value of the assets 

the oil and gas business implements occidental’s strategy primarily by 

Ø   operating and developing areas where reserves are known to exist and optimizing capital intensity in core areas primarily in the permian basin dj basin gulf of mexico uae oman qatar and colombia 

Ø   maintaining a disciplined and prudent approach to capital expenditures with a focus on highreturn shortcycle cashflowgenerating opportunities and an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing occidental’s existing positions 

Ø   focusing occidental’s subsurface characterization and technical activities on unconventional opportunities primarily in the permian basin 

Ø   using enhanced oil recovery techniques such as co 2  water and steam floods in mature fields and 

Ø   focusing on costreduction efficiencies and innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions 

in 2019 oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately 55 billion and primarily focused on occidental’s assets in the permian basin the dj basin gulf of mexico and oman 

business environment 

oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s financial performance the following table presents the average daily west texas intermediate wti brent and new york mercantile exchange nymex prices for 2019 and 2018  



the following table presents occidental’s average realized prices for continuing operations as a percentage of wti brent and nymex for 2019 and 2018  



prices and differentials can vary significantly even on a shortterm basis making it difficult to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty 

domestic interests 

business review 

occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both occidental’s domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years which is extended through the end of production once it commences occidental has leasehold and mineral interests in 144 million net acres of which approximately 39 is leased 55 is owned subsurface mineral rights and 6 is owned land with mineral rights included in occidental’s total net acres is approximately 7 million net acres of primarily undeveloped minerals that pass through colorado wyoming and into utah occidental holds fee ownership of oil and gas mineral and hardrock mineral rights in this area 





the following chart shows occidental’s domestic production volumes for the last five years 

note operations sold include south texas sold in april 2017 piceance sold in march 2016 and williston sold in november 2015 

domestic assets 



permian basin 

the permian basin extends throughout west texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states accounting for more than 30 of total united states oil production in 2019 

occidental manages its permian basin operations through two business units permian resources which includes growthoriented unconventional opportunities and permian eor which utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques such as co 2 floods and waterfloods occidental has a leading position in the permian basin producing approximately 11 of total oil in 

the basin occidental’s position in the texas delaware subbasin was further enhanced through assets acquired as part of the acquisition by exploiting the natural synergies between permian resources and permian eor occidental is able to deliver unique short and longterm advantages efficiencies and expertise across its permian basin operations occidental expects to decrease its permian basin fullcycle breakeven costs while continuing to expand its highquality lowcost 





breakeven inventory occidental expects the combined technical advancements infrastructure utilization opportunities and operations across over 31 million net acres will provide sustainability of occidental’s lowcost position in the permian basin 

in the next few years growth within occidental’s permian basin portfolio is expected to be focused in the permian resources unconventional assets in 2019 occidental spent approximately 38 billion of capital in the permian basin of which over 85 was spent on permian resources assets in 2020 occidental expects to allocate approximately 40 of its worldwide capital budget to permian resources for development and approximately 8 to permian eor for the expansion of existing facilities to increase co 2 production and injection capacity 

in november 2019 occidental and ecopetrol formed a joint venture to explore and develop approximately 97000 net acres of occidental’s midland subbasin properties in the permian basin occidental owns a 51 interest in the joint venture and is the operator in exchange for its 49 interest ecopetrol paid 750 million in cash to occidental at closing and will carry 75 of occidental’s share of capital expenditures up to 750 million the joint venture allows occidental to accelerate its development plans in the midland basin where it currently has minimal activity occidental will retain production and cash flow from its existing operations in the midland basin 



permian resources 

permian resources unconventional oil development projects provide very shortcycle investment payback averaging less than two years and generate some of the highest margin and returns of any oil and gas projects in the world these investments contribute cash flow and production growth while increasing longterm value and sustainability through higher return on capital employed 

as part of the acquisition occidental acquired anadarko’s oil and gas operations in permian resources which included approximately 370000 net acres including 240000 net acres located primarily within loving and reeves counties a new well design and flowback method will be implemented in 2020 which is expected to lower the overall well cost while improving completion efficiency the 2020 plan contemplates the continued development of the newly acquired acreage occidental’s share of production from the acquired assets in permian resources was approximately 159 thousand boe per day mboed from the acquisition date through december 31 2019 overall in 2019 permian resources produced approximately 355 mboed from approximately 7600 gross wells in 2019 permian resources added 173 mmboe to occidental’s proved reserves for improved recovery additions 

permian eor 

the permian basin’s concentration of large conventional reservoirs favorable co 2 flooding performance and the proximity to naturally occurring co 2 supply has resulted in decades of highvalue enhanced oil production with 34 active co 2 floods and over 40 years of experience occidental is the industry leader in permian basin co 2 flooding which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10 to 25 technology improvements such as the recent trend toward vertical expansion of the co 2 flooded interval into residual oil zone targets continue to yield more recovery from existing projects occidental utilizes workover rigs to drill extra depth into additional co 2 floodable sections of the reservoir occidental completed 72 well workovers in 2019 and has plans to complete 81 well workovers in 2020 in 2019 permian eor added 14 mmboe to occidental’s proved 





reserves for improved recovery additions primarily as a result of executing co 2 flood development projects and expansions occidental’s share of production from permian eor was approximately 154 mboed in 2019 

significant opportunities also remain to gain additional recovery by expanding occidental’s existing co 2 projects into new portions of reservoirs that have only been waterflooded permian eor has a large inventory of future co 2 projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated depending on market conditions in addition olcv continues making progress towards supplying anthropogenic or manmade co 2 for the purpose of carbon capture utilization and storage in occidental’s permian eor operations 

dj basin 

through the acquisition occidental is colorado’s top oil and gas producer with interest in approximately 650000 net acres production is derived from 2700 operated vertical wells and 2000 operated horizontal wells primarily focused in 460000 net acres in the niobrara and codell formations the dj basin provides competitive economics low breakeven costs and free cashflow generation 

occidental’s share of production from the dj basin was approximately 303 mboed from the acquisition date through december 31 2019 horizontal drilling results in the field continue to be strong with improved operational efficiencies in drilling and completions 

license to operate continues to be a key focus moving into 2020 occidental has a majority of its planned 2020 completions activity permitted occidental maintains optionality by flexing resources between dj basin and another emerging high rate ofreturn program in the powder river basin 

powder river 

in the southern powder river basin occidental acquired through the acquisition approximately 400000 net acres mainly located in converse county wyoming the field contains the turner niobrara mowry and parkman formations that hold both liquids and natural gas 

greater natural buttes 

the greater natural buttes area in eastern utah is a tightgas asset producing primarily from the mesa verde wasatch and blackhawk formations occidental uses cryogenic and refrigeration processing facilities in this area to extract ngls from the naturalgas stream there was no development activity in this field during 2019 due to capital being allocated to highermargin projects 

offshore domestic assets 

gulf of mexico 

occidental owns a working interest in 230 blocks in the gulf of mexico operates 10 active floating platforms and holds interests in 18 active fields in 2020 occidental will take advantage of its extensive infrastructure across the gulf of mexico to execute its longterm plan for development and exploration it will operate one floating drillship and three platform rigs together with a floating well service rig to cost effectively develop known resources and perform exploration activities to identify tieback opportunities near existing facilities the following table shows areas of continuing development in the gulf of mexico along with the corresponding working interest in those areas acquired assets in the gulf of mexico produced approximately 147 mboed from the acquisition date through december 31 2019 in addition to its portfolio of undeveloped leases occidental’s gulf of mexico exploration assets are primarily related to a deepwater discovery located with tieback proximity to the horn mountain platform 







international interests 

business review 

occidental conducts its ongoing international operations in two subregions the middle east and latin america its activities include oil natural gas and ngl production through direct workinginterest and production sharing contracts psc 

production sharing contracts 

occidental’s interest in oman and dolphin are subject to pscs under such contracts occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain development and production costs and an additional share for profit in addition certain contracts in colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher 

the following chart shows occidental’s international production volumes for the last five years 

note operations sold exited or held for sale include the africa assets sold in 2019 or held for sale at december 31 2019 qatar exited in 2019 and other middle east and north africa operations exited in 2016 and 2015 

middle east assets 







oman 

in oman occidental is the operator of block 9 with a 50 working interest block 27 with a 65 working interest block 53 with a 45 working interest and block 62 with a 100 working interest in 2018 and 2019 occidental entered into exploration and production sharing agreements for blocks 30 51 65 and 72 which increased the acreage that occidental holds in oman from 23 million to 60 million gross acres and the potential well inventory locations to approximately 10000 in 2019 occidental’s share of production was 89 mboed 

the block 9 contract expires in 2030 and the block 27 contract expires in 2035 occidental’s share of production for blocks 9 and 27 was 27 mboed and 7 mboed in 2019 respectively the block 53 mukhaizna field contract expires in 2035 and is a major worldclass pattern steam flood project for enhanced oil recovery that utilizes some of the largest mechanical vapor compressors ever built since assuming operations in mukhaizna in 2005 occidental has drilled over 3450 new wells and has increased gross production by over 15 fold occidental’s share of production for block 53 was 33 mboed in 2019 subject to declaration of commerciality block 62 will expire in 2028 occidental’s share of production for block 62 was 22 mboed in 2019 

united arab emirates 

in 2011 occidental acquired a 40 participating interest in al hosn gas joining with the abu dhabi national oil company adnoc in a 30year joint venture agreement in 2019 occidental’s share of production from al hosn gas was 251 mmcf per day of natural gas and 40000 barrels per day of ngl and condensate al hosn gas includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in “marketing and midstream segment  gas processing gathering and co 2 ” 

in 2019 occidental acquired a 9year exploration concession and subject to a declaration of commerciality a 35year production concession for onshore block 3 which covers an area of approximately 15 million acres and is adjacent to al hosn gas occidental conducts a majority of its middle east business development activities through its office in abu dhabi which also provides various support functions for occidental’s middle east oil and gas operations 

qatar 

in qatar occidental partners in the dolphin energy project an investment that is comprised of two separate economic interests occidental has a 245 interest in the upstream operations to develop and produce natural gas ngl and condensate from qatar’s north field through mid2032 occidental also has a 245 interest in dolphin energy limited which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in “marketing and midstream segment – pipeline” occidental’s net share of production from the dolphin upstream operations was 42 mboed in 2019 

in 2019 occidental’s contract for idd el shargi north dome isnd expired and there was a mutually agreed early termination of its idd el shargi south dome issd contract 

latin america assets 



colombia 

occidental has working interests in the la cirainfantas and teca areas and has operations within the llanos norte basin occidental’s interests range from 39 to 61 and certain interests expire between 2023 and 2038 while others extend through the economic limit of the areas 





in 2019 occidental and ecopetrol initiated teca steam flood project second phase development activities during 2019 17 new wells were drilled and the initial facility upgrade project began 

occidental also farmed into two additional blocks in the prospective putumayo basin consolidating a position of 16 million gross acres in the basin 

occidental’s net share of production from colombia was 33 mboed in 2019  

africa assets 

in september 2019 occidental completed the sale of mozambique lng assets to total for approximately 42 billion in january 2020 occidental completed the sale of south africa assets to total occidental and total continue to work toward completing the sales of the remaining africa assets during 2020 the results of the africa assets are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows the remaining africa assets are classified as heldforsale and not considered part of occidental’s ongoing international operations as of december 31 2019 operations in algeria involve production and development activities in blocks 404a and 208 of algeria’s sahara desert the el merk central processing facility cpf in block 208 processed produced oil and ngl while the hassi berkine south and ourhoud cpfs in block 404a processed only produced oil ghana operations include production and development activities located offshore in the west cape three point block and the deepwater tano block 

proved reserves 

proved oil ngl and natural gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements oil ngl and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity quality and transportation costs 

the following table shows the 2019 2018 and 2017 calculated average prices for both wti and brent oil prices as well as the nymex gas prices 



occidental had proved reserves from continuing operations at yearend 2019 of 3827 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe excluding the africa assets compared to the yearend 2018 amount of 2752 mmboe proved developed reserves represented approximately 76 and 73 of occidental’s total proved reserves at yearend 2019 and 2018  respectively the following table shows the breakout of occidental’s proved reserves from continuing operations by commodity as a percentage of total proved reserves 



occidental does not have any reserves from nontraditional sources for further information regarding occidental’s proved reserves see “supplemental oil and gas information” 

the following table details the proved developed and undeveloped reserves related to the africa assets that were presented as held for sale at december 31 2019 







changes in proved reserves 

occidental’s total proved reserves from continuing operations increased 1075 mmboe in 2019  which was primarily driven by additions of 1311 mmboe primarily from the acquisition and 356 mmboe from occidental’s development program changes in reserves were as follows 



occidental’s ability to add reserves other than through purchases depends on the success of improved recovery extension and discovery projects each of which depends on reservoir characteristics technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices as well as capital and operating costs many of these factors are outside management’s control and may negatively or positively affect occidental’s reserves 

purchases of proved reserves 

in 2019 occidental purchased proved reserves of 1311 mmboe primarily as part of the acquisition including proved reserves in the permian delaware basin the dj basin and gulf of mexico as part of smaller asset purchases separate from the acquisition occidental purchased proved reserves in permian resources new mexico 

revisions of previous estimates 

revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic production decline or operating performance data in addition product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental for example lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves particularly for domestic properties because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations offsetting this effect lower prices increase occidental’s share of proved reserves under pscs because more oil is required to recover costs conversely when prices rise occidental’s share of proved reserves decreases for pscs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data 

in 2019 occidental had negative revisions of 200 mmboe primarily related to negative price revisions changes to development plans and reservoir performance in the permian basin 

improved recovery 

in 2019  occidental added proved reserves of 293 mmboe mainly associated with the permian basin these properties comprise both conventional projects which are characterized by the deployment of eor development methods largely employing application of co 2 flood waterflood or steam flood and unconventional projects these types of conventional eor development methods can be applied through existing wells though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells the use of either co 2 or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation the evaluation of engineering data availability and cost of either co 2 or steam and other economic factors both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells many of occidental’s projects including unconventional projects rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells in addition some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells 

extensions and discoveries 

occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs in 2019  extensions and discoveries added 63 mmboe primarily related to the recognition of proved undeveloped reserves due to postacquisition activities for acquired properties in the permian basin and gulf of mexico 

sales of proved reserves 

in 2019 occidental sold 29 mmboe in proved reserves mainly related to noncore permian basin acreage 





proved undeveloped reserves 

occidental had proved undeveloped reserves at yearend 2019 of 904 mmboe compared to the yearend 2018 amount of 750 mmboe changes in proved undeveloped reserves were as follows 



occidental incurred approximately 18 billion in 2019 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves permian basin added approximately 500 mmboe through improved recovery and purchases 

the 2019 additions to proved undeveloped reserves were partially offset by 196 mmboe transfers to proved developed reserves primarily in the permian basin 166 mmboe of negative revisions of previous estimates primarily related to negative price revisions changes to development plans and reservoir performance in the permian basin 

occidental’s highestreturn projects and most active development areas are located in the permian basin which represented 44 of the proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 2019 nearly half of occidental’s 2020 capital program of 53 billion is allocated to the development program in the permian basin overall occidental plans to spend approximately 36 billion over the next five years to develop its proved undeveloped reserves in the permian basin 

occidental’s proved undeveloped reserves in international locations are associated with approved longterm international development projects 

reserves evaluation and review process 

occidental’s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of december 31 2019  were made by occidental’s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management the estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by occidental to develop the reserves this process involves reservoir engineers geoscientists planning engineers and financial analysts as part of the proved reserves estimation process all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates operating costs and capital expenditures price differentials between benchmark prices the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods including estimates from decline curve analysis type curve analysis material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance these reliable fieldtested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities 

net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor 

net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion proved undeveloped reserves are supported by a fiveyear detailed fieldlevel development plan which includes the timing location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled the development plan is reviewed and approved annually by senior management and technical personnel annually a detailed review is performed by occidental’s worldwide reserves group and its technical personnel on a leasebylease basis to assess whether proved undeveloped reserves are being converted on a timely basis within five years from the initial disclosure date any leases not showing timely transfers from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves are reviewed by senior management to determine if the remaining reserves will be developed in a timely manner and have sufficient capital committed in the development plan only proved undeveloped reserves that are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan a portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved longterm development plans 

the current senior vice president reserves for oxy oil and gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates in compliance with us sec rules and regulations including the internal audit and review of occidental’s oil and gas reserves data he has over 35 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business and has held various assignments in north america asia and europe he is a threetime past chair of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee he is an american association of petroleum geologists aapg certified petroleum geologist and currently serves on the aapg committee on resource evaluation he is a member of the society 





of petroleum evaluation engineers the colorado school of mines potential gas committee and the unece expert group on resource management he has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in geology from emory university in atlanta 

occidental has a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee consisting of senior corporate officers to review and approve occidental’s oil and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidental’s board of directors during the year since 2003 occidental has retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum engineering consultants to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes in addition occidental utilized miller and lents ltd ml independent petroleum engineering consultants who were previously retained by anadarko to review the annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes associated with the anadarko reserves for additional reserves information see supplemental oil and gas information under item 8 of this form 10k 

in 2019  both ryder scott and ml conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of december 31 2019  in accordance with sec regulatory standards ryder scott and ml reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of occidental’s 2019 yearend total proved reserves portfolio in 2019  ryder scott reviewed approximately 20 of legacy occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves since being engaged in 2003 ryder scott has reviewed the specific application of occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 80 of legacy occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves ml reviewed approximately 90 of the anadarko proved oil and gas reserves 

management retained ryder scott and ml to provide objective thirdparty input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process neither ryder scott nor ml has been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by occidental occidental has filed ryder scott’s and ml’s independent reports as exhibits to this form 10k 

based on its reviews including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott and ml have concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current sec regulations 

industry outlook 

the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions wti and brent oil price indexes increased throughout 2019 closing at 6106 per barrel and 6600 per barrel respectively as of december 31 2019  

oil prices will continue to be affected by i global supply and demand which are generally a function of global economic conditions inventory levels production disruptions technological advances regional market conditions and the actions of opec other significant producers and governments ii transportation capacity infrastructure constraints and costs in producing areas iii currency exchange rates and iv the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions 

ngl prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock in addition infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region 

domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas 

these and other factors make it difficult to predict the future direction of oil ngl and domestic gas prices reliably for purposes of the current capital plan occidental will continue to focus on allocating capital to its highestreturn assets with the flexibility to adjust based on fluctuations in commodity prices international gas prices are generally fixed under longterm contracts occidental continues to adjust capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital 







business strategy 

oxychem seeks to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve abovecostofcapital returns the chemical segment focuses on being a lowcost producer in order to maximize cash flow generation oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with the coproduction of caustic soda and chlorine caustic soda and chlorine are marketed to external customers in addition chlorine together with ethylene is converted through a series of intermediate products into polyvinyl chloride pvc oxychem’s focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chloralkali and pvc businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities in 2019 capital expenditures for oxychem totaled 267 million 

business environment 

in 2019 the united states economic growth rate estimated to be 23 was lower than the 29 experienced in 2018 which resulted in lower demand for caustic soda and pvc ethylene prices trended downward in the first half of 2019 before increasing in the second half of the year with the total year average ethylene price being less than that of 2018 pricing for caustic soda and pvc was lower in 2019 partially offset by lower energy and feedstock costs domestic demand for caustic soda and pvc was negatively impacted by slower or no growth in manufacturing automotive and construction markets as well as a weaker pulp and paper market 

business review 

basic chemicals 

the lower us growth rate resulted in lower domestic demand as the industry chloralkali operating rates decreased by 3 compared to 2018 liquid caustic soda prices were lower both domestically and globally in 2019 due to weaker demand in the alumina and pulp and paper market segments which was partially offset by lower energy prices than in 2018 exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain decreased in 2019 as demand for pvc lagged yearoveryear 

vinyls 

demand for pvc in 2019 decreased yearoveryear in total as domestic demand was down 3 from 2018 while export demand increased by less than 1 domestic demand was weaker in the first half of 2019 due to lower construction demand caused by weather conditions and demand did not fully recover in the second half of 2019 export demand growth was driven by emerging economy growth and competitive north american feedstock costs export volume remains a significant portion of pvc sales representing over 34 of total north american producer’s production pvc industry operating rates decreased by 1 compared to 2018 industry pvc margins decreased in 2019 due to lower pvc prices partially offset by lower ethylene prices in the first half of 2019 and lower energy prices than in 2018 

industry outlook 

industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy specifically in the housing construction automotive and durable goods markets the housing and construction markets are expected to strengthen over the next year while the automotive and durable goods markets look to remain flat or decrease slightly margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices weakening in the petroleum industry may negatively affect the demand and pricing of a number of occidental’s products that are consumed by industry participants us commodity export markets will continue to be impacted by the relative strength of the us dollar 

basic chemicals 

continued improvement in the united states housing market offset by flat to weakening automotive and durable goods markets are expected to result in a flattening to a moderate increase in demand for basic chemical products in 2020 export demand for caustic soda is expected to be similar to 2019 levels driven by limited demand improvement into the alumina market chloralkali operating rates should improve moderately with higher demand and continued competitive energy and raw material pricing as compared to global feedstock costs businesses such as calcium chloride and muriatic acid may be affected by flatter us oil growth trends as well as shifts in drilling technology 

vinyls 

north american demand for pvc is expected to improve in 2020 over 2019 levels as growth in residential construction spending is expected to rebound along with upside potential driven by new infrastructure projects although overall demand is expected to increase in north america operating rates are anticipated to remain relatively flat in 2020 as new pvc capacity is expected to enter the market growth in the export market is likely along with favorable ethylene costs continuing in 2020 







business strategy 

the marketing and midstream segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing the use of its gathering processing transportation storage and terminal commitments and by providing access to domestic and international markets to generate returns the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to occidental’s subsidiaries as well as third parties the marketing and midstream segment operates gathering systems gas plants cogeneration facilities and storage facilities and invests in entities that conduct similar activities from august 8 2019 to december 31 2019 wes’s operating results were consolidated in the marketing and midstream segment as of december 31 2019 occidental will account for its ownership investment in wes under the equity method of accounting see note 16  investments and relatedparty transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements

the marketing group markets substantially all of occidental’s oil ngl and natural gas production as well as trades around its assets including contracted transportation and storage capacity occidental’s thirdparty marketing activities focus on purchasing oil ngl and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets these purchases allow occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets in 2019 compared to the prior year marketing results were negatively impacted by the decline in the midlandtogulf coast spreads as well as noncash marktomarket losses 





pipeline 

occidental’s pipeline business mainly consists of its 245 ownership interest in dolphin energy dolphin energy owns and operates a 230milelong 48inchdiameter natural gas pipeline dolphin pipeline which transports dry natural gas from qatar to the uae and oman the dolphin pipeline has capacity to transport up to 32 bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 22 bcf per day and up to 25 bcf per day in the summer months 

in 2019 compared to the prior year pipeline income declined due to the 2018 sale of the centurion pipeline common carrier oil pipeline and storage system and the ingleside crude terminal 

gas processing gathering and co 2 

occidental processes its and thirdparty domestic wet gas to extract ngl and other gas byproducts including co 2  and delivers dry gas to pipelines margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for ngl 

as of december 31 2019 occidental has 545 of limited partner unit interest and a 2 nonvoting general partner unit interest in wes in addition occidental has a 2 nonvoting limited partner interest in western midstream operating lp a consolidated subsidiary of wes prior to december 31 2019 occidental consolidated wes as of december 31 2019 occidental recognizes wes as an equity method investment see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements wes owns gathering systems plants and pipelines and earns revenue from feebased and servicebased contracts with occidental and third parties 

occidental also has a 40 participating interest in al hosn gas which is designed to process 13 bcf per day of natural gas and separate it into salable gas condensate ngl and sulfur in 2019 the facilities produced approximately 11500 metric tons per day of sulfur of which approximately 4600 metric tons was occidental’s share al hosn gas facilities generate revenues from gas processing fees and the sale of sulfur 

in 2019 compared to the prior year gas processing gathering and co 2 results increased primarily due to income from wes partially offset by lower ngl prices and sulfur prices which negatively impacted the gas processing business 

power generation facilities 

earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties 

low carbon ventures 

olcv was formed to execute on occidental’s vision to reduce global emissions and provide a more sustainable future through low carbon energy and products olcv capitalizes on occidental’s extensive experience in utilizing co 2 for eor by investing in technologies developing projects and providing services to facilitate and accelerate the implementation of carbon capture utilization and storage projects and opportunities for zerocarbon power moreover olcv is fostering new technologies and business models with the potential to position occidental as a leader in the production of lowcarbon oil and products 

industry outlook 

marketing and midstream segment results can experience volatility depending on the midland to gulf coast spreads and commodity price changes the decline in the midland to gulf coast spreads in the second half of 2019 has continued into the early part of 2020 if the spread remains at current levels or are lower for the rest of 2020 this could significantly reduce margins in the marketing business to a lesser extent declines in commodity prices including ngl and sulfur prices would reduce the results for the gas processing business 







segment results of operations 

segment earnings exclude income taxes interest income interest expense environmental remediation expenses unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments’ equity investments seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in occidental’s consolidated quarterly earnings during the year 

the following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items for the years ended december 31 



 





items affecting comparability 

oil and gas segment 

results of operations 



 

the following table sets forth the average realized prices for oil ngl and natural gas from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2019  and includes a yearoveryear change calculation 



domestic oil and gas results excluding items affecting comparability increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher oil ngl and natural gas sales volumes mostly due to added production from the acquisition and increased production in the legacy occidental permian resources operations partially offset by lower realized oil ngl and natural gas prices domestic oil and gas results excluding significant items affecting comparability increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in average domestic realized oil prices higher volumes and lower dda rates 





international oil and gas results excluding significant items affecting comparability decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower volumes from the expiration of the isnd contract and early termination of the issd contract as well as a decrease in realized oil prices in latin america and the middle east international oil and gas results excluding significant items affecting comparability increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in realized oil prices in latin america and the middle east respectively 

production 

the following table sets forth the production volumes of oil ngl and natural gas per day from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2019 and includes a yearoveryear change calculation 



   

average daily production volumes from ongoing operations increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to 264 mboed in acquired production from the acquisition including 120 mboed in dj basin 58 mboed in the gulf of mexico and 63 mboed in the delaware basin as well as an increase of 78 mboed in the legacy occidental permian resources operations as a result of increased drilling and well productivity 

average daily production volumes from ongoing operations increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher permian resources production which increased by 52 from the prior year due to developmental drilling activity and improved well performance 

lease operating expense 

the following table sets forth the average lease operating expense per boe from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2019  



  

average lease operating expense per boe decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to operational efficiencies related to maintenance and support cost combined 2019 permian resources lease operating expense per boe was 680 which represented a decrease of 6 from the prior year 

average lease operating costs per boe excluding taxes other than on income increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased surface operations and maintenance costs permian resources lease operating costs per boe for 2018 decreased by 10 from the prior year and the fourth quarter of 2018 costs were below 700 per boe due to continued improved operational efficiencies 





chemical segment 



chemical segment results decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower realized caustic soda prices and lower domestic demand across many product lines partially offset by favorable feedstock costs the 2019 earnings also reflected fees received under a pipeline easement agreement that was executed during the first quarter of 2019 

chemical segment results increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to significant improvements in realized caustic soda pricing strong margins and demand across many product lines and lower ethylene costs slightly offset by decreased caustic soda export volumes the 2018 earnings also benefited from the fullyear equity contributions from the joint venture ethylene cracker in ingleside texas and additional earning contributions from the geismar louisiana plant expansion to produce 4cpe 

marketing and midstream segment 



 

marketing and midstream segment results excluding items affecting comparability decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower marketing margins from the decrease in the midlandtogulf coast spreads by approximately 400 per barrel and lower pipeline income due to the 2018 sales of the centurion pipeline and the ingleside crude oil terminal 

marketing and midstream segment results excluding items affecting comparability increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher marketing margins from improved midlandtogulf coast spreads and higher gas plant income due to higher domestic ngl prices and higher sulfur prices in connection with al hosn gas sulfur sales 

corporate 

  

significant corporate items during 2019 include the following 









deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets of 37 billion were 97 billion at december 31 2019  the deferred tax assets net of allowances are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences 

worldwide effective tax rate 

the following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations 



in 2019 occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate was 373 which was largely a result of acquisitionrelated costs and charges associated with the loss of control of wes for which occidental received no tax benefit excluding the impact of items affecting comparability occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate for 2019 would be 36 

the increase in worldwide effective tax rate from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to the 2017 remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities to the new federal corporate income tax rate 



revenue and other income items 



price and volume changes generally represent the majority of the change in the oil and gas and chemical segments sales marketing and midstream sales are mainly impacted by the change in the midlandtogulf coast spread for the marketing business and to a lesser extent the change in ngl and sulfur prices for the gas processing business 

the increase in net sales in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher domestic volumes related to the acquisition which added approximately 35 billion in net sales as well as increased production activity in occidental’s permian resources operations partially offset by oil ngl and natural gas prices in the oil and gas segment and lower realized caustic soda prices in the chemical segment 

the increase in net sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was mainly due to higher oil prices and higher domestic oil volumes as well as higher marketing margins in the marketing and midstream segment due to improved midlandtogulf coast spreads and higher realized caustic soda prices in the chemical segment average worldwide realized oil prices rose approximately 24 from 2017 to 2018 

the 2019 gain on sale included a net gain of 475 million related to occidental’s midland basin joint venture with ecopetrol and sale of real estate assets and 114 million from the sale of occidental’s remaining equity investment in plains 

the 2018 gain on sale included the sale of noncore domestic midstream assets including the centurion common carrier pipeline and storage system southeast new mexico oil gathering system and ingleside crude terminal of 907 million 

the 2017 gain on sale included the sale of south texas and noncore proved and unproved permian acreage

chemical and midstream cost of sales 

chemical and midstream cost of sales decreased slightly in 2019 from the prior year primarily due to favorable raw material costs in the chemical segment partially offset by an increase in midstream operation costs due to wes 

chemical and midstream cost of sales decreased slightly in 2018 from the prior year primarily due to lower gas plant and maintenance expenses in the midstream segment 

purchased commodities 

purchased commodities included purchased oil volumes for which occidental does not act as agent several of these oil purchase agreements commenced in midyear 2018 the increase in 2019 from the prior year is due to a full year of purchases under these contracts which are used to ensure the full utilization of committed transportation capacity in the marketing business similarly the purchased oil volumes for contracts effective in late 2017 but in effect for the full year of 2018 caused the increase between those years 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expense increased in 2019 from the prior year primarily due to higher employee costs related to the acquisition 

selling general and administrative expense increased in 2018 from the prior year due to higher compensation costs 

other operating and nonoperating expense

other operating and nonoperating expense increased in 2018 from the prior year primarily due to higher environmental costs 

taxes other than on income 

taxes other than on income in 2019 increased from the prior year primarily due to production taxes on higher oil ngl and natural gas volumes as well as additional ad valorem tax related to the acquisition 

taxes other than on income increased in 2018 from the prior year primarily due to higher production taxes which are directly tied to higher commodity prices 





depreciation depletion and amortization 

dda expense increased in 2019 from prior year primarily due to increased production related to the acquisition 

dda expense decreased slightly in 2018 from the prior year due to lower domestic dda rates due to higher reserves partially offset by higher production volumes and higher dda rates in the middle east 

asset impairments and other charges 

asset impairments and other charges are primarily related to a 1 billion loss on the december 31 2019 loss of control of wes in addition occidental incurred impairment charges of approximately 285 million related to domestic undeveloped mineral leases that were set to expire in the near term where occidental had no plans to pursue exploration activities and 39 million related to early termination of its qatar issd contract 

in 2018 occidental incurred impairment and other charges of approximately 416 million on proved oil and gas properties and inventory in qatar due to the decline in oil prices also in 2018 the marketing and midstream segment incurred approximately 100 million of charges primarily for lower of cost or market adjustments on its crude inventory and line fill 

in 2017 occidental incurred impairment and other charges of 545 million of which 397 million related to proved and unproved noncore permian acreage and 120 million for idled marketing and midstream assets 

anadarko acquisitionrelated costs

income tax expense increased in 2018 from the prior year primarily due to tax reform in 2017 and higher pretax income in 2018 occidental recorded an income tax benefit in 2017 due to the revaluation of deferred taxes as a result of the corporate tax rate reduction enacted as part of tax reform partially offset by higher pretax operating income as a result of a recovery in commodity prices 







at december 31 2019  occidental had approximately 30 billion in cash and cash equivalents a substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the united states at december 31 2019 occidental had 05 billion in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents which was primarily associated with a benefits trust for former anadarko employees that was funded as part of the acquisition restricted cash within the benefits trust will be made available to occidental as benefits are paid to former anadarko employees 

debt activity 

in august 2019 occidental issued 130 billion of new senior unsecured notes consisting of both floating and fixed rate debt occidental also borrowed under the term loans which consisted of 1 a 364day senior unsecured variablerate term loan tranche of 44 billion and 2 a twoyear senior unsecured variablerate term loan tranche of 44 billion in total the 218 billion in debt issued was used to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition through the acquisition occidental assumed anadarko debt with an outstanding principal balance of 119 billion 

in 2019 occidental paid approximately 70 billion of longterm debt including a majority of the term loans using proceeds from assets sales and available cash 

on june 3 2019 occidental entered into an amendment to its existing 30 billion revolving credit facility occidental rcf pursuant to which among other things the commitments under the occidental rcf were increased to 50 billion at the closing of the acquisition borrowings under the occidental rcf bear interest at various benchmark rates including london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin based on occidental’s senior debtratings the facility has similar terms to other debt agreements and does not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict occidental’s ability to borrow or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt repayment the facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur occidental has not drawn down any amounts under the occidental rcf 

as of december 31 2019  under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on or acquisitions of occidental stock 

with a continued focus on capital and operational efficiencies occidental expects to fund its liquidity needs including future dividend payments through cash on hand cash generated from operations monetization of noncore assets or investments and if necessary proceeds from other forms of capital issuance 

cash flow analysis 

cash provided by operating activities 



cash provided by operating activities decreased 294 million in 2019 compared to 2018 reflecting acquisition related costs higher interest expense and slightly lower oil prices which were partially offset by a 92 increase in domestic production volumes 

cash provided by operating activities increased 28 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 reflecting higher realized worldwide oil and ngl prices which increased by 24 and 21 respectively as well as a 25 increase in domestic oil volumes operating cash flows in 2018 also benefited from higher marketing margins in the marketing and midstream segment due to improved midlandtogulf coast spreads and higher chemical margins from significant improvements in caustic soda prices 





cash used by investing activities 



a included 365 million related to wes in 2019 

the increase in cash flows used by investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily reflected the cash portion of the acquisition consideration partially offset by the cash acquired in 2019 proceeds from the sale of assets and equity investments net included the sale of mozambique lng assets the ecopetrol joint venture the equity investment in plains and real estate assets occidental’s capital expenditures increased by 14 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase was primarily related to the permian basin due to its high returns of legacy operations coupled with the addition of assets through the acquisition in the permian basin dj basin and gulf of mexico occidental’s 2020 capital spending is expected to be 53 billion 

the increase in cash flows used by investing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was a result of additional capital spending primarily in the permian basin due to its high returns in 2018 proceeds from sale of assets and equity investments net related to the sale of noncore domestic midstream assets partially offset by purchases of businesses and assets net related to the acquisition of a previously leased power and steam cogeneration plant 

cash provided used by financing activities 



cash provided by financing activities in 2019 increased 253 billion  compared to 2018 primarily due to net proceeds from longterm debt of 216 billion and the issuance of 100 billion of preferred shares with a warrant used to fund the acquisition these proceeds were partially offset by debt payments of  70 billion and dividends on common stock of 26 billion  







guarantees 

occidental has guaranteed its portion of the debt of dolphin energy an equity method investment and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds letters of credit indemnities and commitments provided by occidental to third parties mainly to provide assurance that opc or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations see “oil and gas segment — business review — qatar” and “segment results of operations” for further information about dolphin as of december 31 2019  and 2018 occidental had provided limited recourse guarantees on approximately 242 million and 244 million  respectively of dolphin energy’s debt which are limited to certain political and other events 



  

delivery commitments 

occidental has made commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil natural gas and ngl the total amount contracted to be delivered in the united states is approximately 158 million barrels of oil through 2025 1346 bcf of gas through 2035 and 660 million barrels of ngl through 2035 the price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes and crossreferences occidental’s contractual obligations and indicates on and offbalance sheet obligations as of december 31 2019  



 







  

legal matters 

occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property damage or other losses punitive damages civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar federal state local and foreign environmental laws these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties and injunctive relief usually occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies further some lawsuits claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction 

in accordance with applicable accounting guidance occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated reserves for matters other than for environmental remediation that satisfy this criteria as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 were not material to occidental’s consolidated balance sheets 

on may 30 2019 a complaint was filed in the court of chancery of the state of delaware by purported occidental stockholders high river limited partnership icahn partners master fund lp and icahn partners lp the “icahn complainants” captioned high river ltd p’ship v occidental petroleum corp ca no 20190403jrs seeking inspection of occidental’s books and records pursuant to section 220 of the delaware general corporation law in the complaint the icahn complainants noted that they had accumulated over 16 billion of occidental common stock on june 14 2019 occidental filed an answer to the complaint in the court of chancery of the state of delaware a trial was held on september 20 2019 and the court dismissed the icahn complaint the icahn complainants appealed and oral arguments occurred in february 2020 

in 2016 occidental received payments from the republic of ecuador of approximately 10 billion pursuant to a november 2015 arbitration award for ecuador’s 2006 expropriation of occidental’s participation contract for block 15 the awarded amount represented a recovery of 60 of the value of block 15 in 2017 andes petroleum ecuador ltd andes filed a demand for arbitration claiming it is entitled to a 40 share of the judgment amount obtained by occidental occidental contends that andes is not entitled to any of the amounts paid under the 2015 arbitration award because occidental’s recovery was limited to occidental’s own 60 economic interest in the block the merits hearing is scheduled for may 2020 occidental intends to vigorously defend against this claim in arbitration 

the ultimate outcome and impact of outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings on occidental cannot be predicted management believes that the resolution of these matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on occidental’s consolidated balance sheets if unfavorable outcomes of these matters were to occur future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected occidental’s estimates are based on information known about the legal matters and its experience in contesting litigating and settling similar matters occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available 

  

tax matters 

during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax jurisdictions taxable years through 2016 for us federal income tax purposes have been audited by the us internal revenue service irs pursuant to its compliance assurance program and subsequent taxable years are currently under review taxable years through 2009 have been audited for state income tax purposes while a single foreign tax jurisdiction is open for 2002 all other significant audit matters in foreign jurisdictions have been resolved through 2010 during the course of tax audits disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

for anadarko its taxable years through 2016 for us federal and state income tax purposes have been audited by the irs and respective state taxing authorities there are outstanding significant audit matters in one foreign jurisdiction during the course of the tax audit disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law other than the matter discussed below occidental believes that the resolution of these outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

anadarko received an 881 million tentative refund in 2016 related to its 52 billion tronox settlement payment in 2015 in september 2018 anadarko received a statutory notice of deficiency from the irs disallowing the net operating loss carryback and rejecting anadarko’s refund claim as a result anadarko filed a petition with the us tax court to dispute the disallowances in november 2018 the case is currently in the irs appeals process if the matter is not resolved in the irs appeals process occidental expects to continue pursuing resolution in the us tax court 

while occidental believes it is entitled to this refund in accordance with asc 740’s guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2019 occidental has recorded no tax benefit on the tentative cash tax refund of 





881 million as a result should occidental not ultimately prevail on the issue there would be no additional tax expense recorded for financial statement purposes other than future interest however in that event occidental would be required to repay approximately 925 million  898 million federal and 27 million in state taxes plus accrued interest of approximately 189 million  as a result a liability for this amount has been recorded in deferred credits and other liabilities  other at december 31 2019 

  

indemnities to third parties 

occidental its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2019 occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 



  

occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal state local and international laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality the laws that require or address environmental remediation including comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar federal state local and international laws may apply retroactively and regardless of fault the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites opc or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating closed and thirdparty sites remedial activities may include one or more of the following investigation involving sampling modeling risk assessment or monitoring cleanup measures including removal treatment or disposal or operation and maintenance of remedial systems the environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties injunctive relief and government oversight costs 

  

environmental remediation 

as of december 31 2019  occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 177 sites which included 36 sites assumed through the acquisition the following table presents occidental’s current and noncurrent environmental remediation liabilities as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities  162 million in 2019 and 120 million in 2018 and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities  environmental remediation liabilities  104 billion in 2019 and 762 million in 2018 occidental continues to evaluate the remediation obligations assumed through the acquisition 

occidental’s environmental remediation sites are grouped into four categories national priorities list npl sites listed or proposed for listing by the epa on the cercla npl and three categories of nonnpl sites — thirdparty sites occidentaloperated sites and closed or nonoperated occidental sites 



  

as of december 31 2019  occidental’s environmental remediation liabilities exceeded 10 million each at 20 of the 177 sites described above and 101 of the sites had liabilities from 0 to 1 million each as of december 31 2019  three sites — the diamond alkali superfund site and a former chemical plant in ohio both of which are indemnified by maxus energy corporation as discussed further below and a landfill in western new york — accounted for 94 percent of its liabilities associated with npl sites seventeen of the 36 npl sites are indemnified by maxus 

six of the 74 thirdparty sites — a maxusindemnified chrome site in new jersey a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee a former oil field a landfill and a chemical plant in california and an active refinery in louisiana where occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities — accounted for 75 percent of occidental’s liabilities associated with these sites nine of the 74 thirdparty sites are indemnified by maxus 

five sites — oil and gas operations in colorado and chemical plants in kansas louisiana new york and texas — accounted for 67 percent of the liabilities associated with the occidentaloperated sites 





six other sites — a landfill in western new york a former refinery in oklahoma former chemical plants in california tennessee and washington and a closed coal mine in pennsylvania — accounted for 64 percent of the liabilities associated with closed or nonoperated occidental sites 

environmental remediation liabilities vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation based on current estimates occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the year end remediation balance over the next three to four years with the remainder over the subsequent 10 or more years occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those amounts currently recorded for environmental remediation for all of its environmental sites could be up to 11 billion  

  

maxus environmental sites 

when occidental acquired diamond shamrock chemicals company dscc in 1986 maxus a subsidiary of ypf sa ypf agreed to indemnify occidental for a number of environmental sites including the diamond alkali superfund site site along a portion of the passaic river on june 17 2016 maxus and several affiliated companies filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal district court in the state of delaware prior to filing for bankruptcy maxus defended and indemnified occidental in connection with cleanup and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity including the site 

in march 2016 the epa issued a record of decision rod specifying remedial actions required for the lower 83 miles of the lower passaic river the rod does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river or newark bay during the third quarter of 2016 and following maxus’s bankruptcy filing occidental and the epa entered into an administrative order on consent aoc to complete the design of the proposed cleanup plan outlined in the rod at an estimated cost of 165 million the epa announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties 

occidental has accrued a remediation liability relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and the remediation called for in the aoc and the rod as well as for certain other maxusindemnified sites occidental’s accrued estimated environmental remediation liability does not consider any recoveries for indemnified costs occidental’s ultimate share of the estimated costs may be higher or lower than its accrued remediation liability and is subject to final design plans and the resolution with other potentially responsible parties occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the aoc the rod and to perform remediation at other maxusindemnified sites in light of the maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties in june 2018 occidental filed a complaint under cercla in federal district court in the state of new jersey against numerous potentially responsible parties for reimbursement of amounts incurred or to be incurred to comply with the aoc the rod or to perform other remediation activities at the site 

in june 2017 the court overseeing the maxus bankruptcy approved a plan of liquidation plan to liquidate maxus and create a trust to pursue claims against ypf repsol and others to satisfy claims by occidental and other creditors for past and future cleanup and other costs in july 2017 the courtapproved plan became final and the trust became effective among other responsibilities the trust will pursue claims against ypf repsol and others and distribute assets to maxus’ creditors in accordance with the trust agreement and plan in june 2018 the trust filed its complaint against ypf and repsol in delaware bankruptcy court asserting claims based upon among other things fraudulent transfer and alter ego on february 15 2019 the bankruptcy court denied repsol’s and ypf’s motions to dismiss the complaint 

  

environmental costs 

occidental’s environmental costs some of which include estimates are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended december 31 



  

operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures relate to longerlived improvements in properties currently operated by occidental remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations 







a portion of occidental’s assets are located outside north america the following table shows the geographic distribution of occidental’s assets at december 31 2019 at both the segment and consolidated level related to occidental’s ongoing operations 



for the year ended december 31 2019  net sales outside north america totaled 46 billion or approximately 22 of total net sales 



the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires occidental’s management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts the selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management’s judgment 

  

oil and gas properties 

the carrying value of occidental’s property plant and equipment ppe represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset including any asset retirement obligations aros and capitalized interest net of dda and any impairment charges for assets acquired in a business combination ppe cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets 

occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found if proved reserves have been found the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory drilling costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the economic and operating viability of the project at the end of each quarter management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities in particular whether occidental is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed 

occidental expenses annual lease rentals the costs of injectants used in production and geological geophysical and seismic costs as incurred 

occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unitofproduction method it amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether 





deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 

several factors could change occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves for example occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices in other cases particularly with longlived properties lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical for such properties higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidental’s control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded 

additionally occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable if there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to significant and prolonged declines in current and forward prices significant changes in reserve estimates changes in management’s plans or other significant events management will evaluate the property for impairment under the successful efforts method if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants the impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time these assumptions include estimates of future production product prices contractual prices estimates of riskadjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs it is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in additional impairments 

for impairment testing unless prices are contractually fixed occidental uses observable forward strip prices for oil and natural gas prices when projecting future cash flows future operating and development costs are estimated using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce oil and gas reserves market prices for oil natural gas and ngl have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future changes in global supply and demand transportation capacity currency exchange rates and applicable laws and regulations and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions could impact current forecasts future fluctuations in commodity prices could result in estimates of future cash flows to vary significantly 

the most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in occidental’s oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the dda rate for example a 5 increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the dda rate by approximately 115 per barrel which would increase or decrease pretax income by approximately 415 million annually at current production rates 

a portion of the carrying value of occidental’s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were 295 billion at december 31 2019  and 10 billion at december 31 2018 the 2019 amount is primarily related to the acquisition the unproved amounts are not subject to dda until they are classified as proved properties individually insignificant unproved properties are combined and amortized on a group basis based on factors such as lease terms success rates and other factors if the exploration efforts are unsuccessful or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices higher development and operating costs contractual conditions or other factors the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed the timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties if warranted depends upon management’s plans the nature timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results occidental periodically reviews unproved properties for impairments numerous factors are considered including but not limited to current exploration plans favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property or the adjacent property geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining lease term for the property management’s assessment of the availability of funds for future activities and the current and projected political and regulatory climate in areas in which occidental operates also impacts the timing of any impairment 

  

proved reserves 

occidental estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the sec and fasb this definition includes oil natural gas and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods government regulations etc at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions for reserves information see the supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities under item 8 of this form 10k 

engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information occidental’s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting 





and processing the hydrocarbons these estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised either upward or downward as warranted by additional data revisions are necessary due to changes in among other things development plans reservoir performance prices economic conditions and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date a material adverse change in the estimated volume of proved reserves could have a negative impact on dda and could result in property impairments 

  

fair values 

occidental estimates fairvalue of longlived assets for impairment testing assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in nonmonetary transactions pension plan assets and initial measurements of aros 

accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value 

occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs when estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed occidental must apply various assumptions 

  

financial assets and liabilities 

occidental utilizes the midpoint between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its financial assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value in addition to using market data occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value occidental measures fair value using the following methods 

  

Ø occidental values exchangecleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date these derivatives are classified as level 1 

   

nonfinancial assets 

occidental uses marketobservable prices for assets when comparable transactions can be identified that are similar to the asset being valued when occidental is required to measure fair value and there is not a marketobservable price for the asset or for a similar asset then the cost or income approach is used depending on the quality of information available to support management’s assumptions the cost approach is based on management’s best estimate of the current asset replacement cost the income approach is based on management’s best assumptions regarding expectations of future net cash flows and the expected cash flows are discounted using a commensurate riskadjusted discount rate such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput development and operating costs and the timing thereof economic and regulatory climates and other factors most of which are often outside of management’s control however assumptions used reflect a market participant’s view of longterm prices costs and other factors and are consistent with assumptions used in the company’s business plans and investment decisions 

  

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate occidental records environmental liabilities and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the environmental remediation liability and the range of reasonably possible additional losses occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience remedial objectives available technologies applicable laws and regulations and costsharing arrangements occidental bases its environmental remediation liabilities on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred using the most costeffective technology reasonably 





expected to achieve the remedial objective occidental periodically reviews its environmental remediation liabilities and adjusts them as new information becomes available occidental records environmental remediation liabilities on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established the reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established presently none of its environmental remediation liabilities are recorded on a discounted basis occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received or when receipt of recovery is highly probable 

many factors could affect occidental’s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental remediation liabilities and the range of reasonably possible additional losses the most significant are 1 cost estimates for remedial activities may vary from the initial estimate 2 the length of time type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination 3 a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify occidental’s proposed remedial plan 4 improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs 5 laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability and 6 changes in allocation or costsharing arrangements may occur 

certain sites involve multiple parties with various costsharing arrangements which fall into the following three categories 1 environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties 2 oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest or 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of properties in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs in these circumstances occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate when estimating occidental’s ultimate share of liability occidental records its environmental remediation liabilities at its expected net cost of remedial activities and based on these factors believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved 

in addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures which often take in excess of 10 years at cercla npl sites occidental’s environmental remediation liabilities include management’s estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and adjusts its liabilities accordingly 

if occidental were to adjust the balance of its environmental remediation liabilities based on the factors described above the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings for example if the balance were reduced by 10 occidental would record a pretax gain of 120 million if the balance were increased by 10 occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 120 million 

  

income taxes 

occidental files various us federal state and foreign income tax returns the impact of changes in tax regulations are reflected when enacted in general deferred federal state and foreign income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis occidental routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets if occidental concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance occidental recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefit recorded is equal to the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized through final settlement with a taxing authority interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense benefit occidental uses the flowthrough method to account for its investment tax credits see note 12  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

loss contingencies 

occidental is involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings and audits occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis 

loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate management’s judgments could change based on new information changes in or interpretations of laws or regulations changes in management’s plans or intentions opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings or other factors see “lawsuits claims and contingencies” for additional information

general 

occidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil ngl and natural gas prices price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect occidental’s pretax annual income by approximately 260 million for a 1 per barrel change in oil prices and 90 million for a 1 per barrel change in ngl prices if domestic natural gas prices varied by 050 per mcf it would have an estimated annual effect on occidental’s pretax income of approximately 185 million these pricechange sensitivities include the impact of psc and similar contract volume changes on income if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidental’s results to prices also will change marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil natural gas and to a lesser degree other commodities these sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing volumes and cannot be predicted reliably 

occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices a variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of 10 per ton would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 10 million and 30 million respectively a variation in pvc prices of 001 per lb would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 30 million historically over time product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins 

occidental uses derivative instruments including a combination of shortterm futures forwards options and swaps to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas 

  

risk management 

occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies the controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check members of the risk management group report to the corporate vice president and treasurer controls for these activities include limits on value at risk limits on credit limits on total notional trade value segregation of duties delegation of authority daily price verifications reporting to senior management on various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls 

  

fair value of marketing derivative contracts 

occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value fair values for these contracts are derived from level 1 and level 2 sources the fair values in future maturity periods are insignificant 

the following table shows the fair value of occidental’s derivatives excluding collateral segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation 



  





cashflow hedges 

occidental’s marketing operations from time to time store natural gas purchased from third parties at occidental’s north american leased storage facilities as of december 31 2019 and 2018 occidental had approximately 6 bcf and 5 bcf of natural gas held in storage respectively and had cashflow hedges for the forecast sales to be settled by physical delivery of approximately 3 bcf and 4 bcf of stored natural gas respectively 

  

quantitative information 

occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities this measure determines the maximum potential negative one day change in fair value with a 95 level of confidence additionally occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice as a result of these controls occidental believes that the market risk of its trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance 

  



general 

occidental acquired interest rate swap contracts in the acquisition occidental pays a fixed interest rate and receives a floating interest rate indexed to threemonth libor the swaps have an initial term of 30 years with mandatory termination dates in september 2020 through 2023 and a total notional amount of 1475 billion as of december 31 2019 in october 2019 125 million of notional interest rate swaps were terminated as of december 31 2019 the fair value of the swaps of negative 14 billion net liability was offset by 104 million in posted cash collateral resulting in a net 13 billion liability a 25basis point decrease in implied libor rates over the term of the swaps would result in an additional liability of approximately 101 million on these swaps in january and february 2020 occidental extended september 2020 mandatory termination dates to september 2021 and september 2022 for swaps with a notional value of 500 million and 150 million  respectively 

as of december 31 2019 occidental had 45 billion of variablerate debt outstanding a 25basis point increase in libor interest rates would increase gross interest expense approximately 11 million per year 

as of december 31 2019 occidental had 343 billion of fixedrate debt outstanding a 25basis point change in treasury rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt approximately 680 million 

tabular presentation of interest rate risk 

the table below provides information about occidental’s debt obligations debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date including amounts assumed from the acquisition except wes debt 



 



occidental’s international operations have limited currency risk occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes a vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in united states dollars additionally all of occidental’s consolidated international oil and gas subsidiaries have the united states dollar as the functional currency as of december 31 2019  the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the marketing operations was immaterial the effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income 







the majority of occidental’s counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants as appropriate occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis 

certain overthecounter derivative instruments contain creditriskcontingent features primarily tied to credit ratings for occidental or its counterparties which may affect the amount of collateral that each party would need to post the aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with creditriskcontingent features for which a net liability position existed at december 31 2019 was 787 million net of 169 million collateral primarily related to acquired interestrate swaps and 68 million net of 1 million of collateral existed at december 31 2018 

as of december 31 2019  the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties occidental believes its exposure to creditrelated losses at december 31 2019  was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented 



as of december 31 2019 occidental had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future oil production of 350 thousand barrels per day as of december 31 2019 these derivative instruments were at a 68 million net derivative liability position 

the following table shows a sensitivity analysis based on both a 5 and 10 change in commodity prices and their effect on the net derivative liability position of 68 million at december 31 2019

 item 9a controls and procedures 



the management of occidental petroleum corporation and its subsidiaries occidental is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting occidental’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles occidental’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of occidental’s assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that occidental’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of occidental’s management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of occidental’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management has assessed the effectiveness of occidental’s internal control system as of december 31 2019  based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control  integrated framework issued in 2013 by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management believes that as of december 31 2019  occidental’s system of internal control over financial reporting is effective 

occidental’s independent auditors kpmg llp have issued an audit report on occidental’s internal control over financial reporting 



occidental’s president and chief executive officer and its senior vice president and chief financial officer supervised and participated in occidental’s evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation occidental’s president and chief executive officer and senior vice president and chief financial officer concluded that occidental’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2019  

except as described below there has been no change in occidental’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act during the fourth quarter of 2019 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect occidental’s internal control over financial reporting the report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting is set forth in item 8 

in the third quarter of 2019 occidental started the process of integrating anadarko into its operations and internal control processes resulting in some of anadarko’s historical internal controls being superseded by occidental’s internal controls management will continue to integrate anadarko’s historical internal controls over financial reporting with occidental’s internal controls over financial reporting this integration may lead to changes in occidental’s or anadarko’s historical internal controls over financial reporting in future fiscal periods occidental is also in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system which was implemented in january 2020 occidental intends to integrate anadarko’s internal control processes into occidental’s internal control processes in conjunction with implementation of the erp system management expects the integration process to be completed during 2021

 item 1a risk factors 

volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidentals financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products particularly oil and to a lesser extent natural gas and ngl and its chemical products 

prices for crude oil natural gas and ngl fluctuate widely historically the markets for crude oil natural gas and ngl have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future if the prices of oil natural gas or ngl continue to be volatile or decline occidentals operations financial condition cash flows level of expenditures and the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties may be materially and adversely affected prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in occidentals control these factors include among others 

 

the longterm effects of these and other conditions on the prices of crude oil natural gas ngl and refined products are uncertain generally occidentals practice is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities management may elect to hedge the price risk of crude oil natural gas and ngl in the future and commodity price risk management and hedging activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to regulatory and other risks 

the prices obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the united states and 

 

global economies as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

occidental may experience delays cost overruns losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities 

oil natural gas and ngl exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil natural gas and ngl production in its development and exploration activities occidental bears the risks of 

 

exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses 

governmental actions and political instability may affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s businesses are subject to the actions and decisions of many federal state local and foreign governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 



  

 

in addition occidental has and may continue to experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability nationalizations corruption armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources 

occidentals oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves 

results of operations reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend in part on occidental’s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves occidental has many competitors including national oil companies some of which i are larger and better funded ii may be willing to accept greater risks iii have greater access to capital iv have substantially larger staffs or v have special competencies competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts further during periods of low product prices any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts also there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry our failure to acquire properties grow production replace reserves and attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 

in addition occidental’s acquisition activities carry risks that it may i not fully realize anticipated benefits due to lessthanexpected reserves or production or changed circumstances such as declines in crude oil ngl and gas prices ii bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties iii experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity or iv assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated 

occidental’s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability including production decline rates operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices future operating costs and capital expenditures workover and remedial costs assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies the quantity quality and interpretation of relevant data taxes 

 

and availability of funds the procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants however there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves actual production revenues expenditures crude oil natural gas and ngl prices and taxes with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates and the variance may be material if occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected 

in addition the discounted cash flows included in this form 10k should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted 12month average firstdayofthemonth prices in accordance with sec regulations actual future prices and costs may differ materially from sec regulationcompliant prices and costs used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves also actual future net cash flows may differ from these discounted net cash flows due to the amount and timing of actual production availability of financing for capital expenditures necessary to develop our undeveloped reserves supply and demand for oil natural gas and ngl increases or decreases in consumption of oil natural gas and ngl and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 

concerns about climate change and further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may adversely affect occidental’s operations or results 

continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional and local legislation and regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in december 2009 the epa determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are according to the epa contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes based on these findings the epa began adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the clean air act for example the epa issued rules restricting methane emissions from hydraulically fractured and refractured gas wells compressors pneumatic controls storage vessels and natural gas processing plants 

in the absence of federal legislation to significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to date many state governments have have established rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions including greenhouse gas cap and trade programs most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries and natural gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in the future the united states may also choose to adhere to international agreements targeting greenhouse gas reductions these and other government actions relating to greenhouse gas emissions could require occidental to incur increased operating and maintenance costs such as costs to 

  

purchase and operate emissions control systems to acquire emissions allowances pay carbon taxes or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for oil natural gas and other products that occidental’s businesses produce any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming and thereby reduce demand for oil natural gas and other products produced by occidental’s businesses and lower the value of its reserves consequently government actions designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on occidental’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows and reserves 

there also have been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community including investment advisers and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities operations and ability to access capital finally increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against occidental without regard to causation or our contribution to the asserted damage which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business we have been named in certain private litigation relating to these matters 

it is difficult to predict the timing and certainty of such government actions and the ultimate effect on occidental which could depend on among other things the type and extent of greenhouse gas reductions required the availability and price of emissions allowances or credits the availability and price of alternative fuel sources the energy sectors covered and occidental’s ability to recover the costs incurred through its operating agreements or the pricing of the company’s oil ngl natural gas and other products 

occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic events 

the occurrence of events such as hurricanes floods droughts earthquakes or other acts of nature well blowouts fires explosions pipeline ruptures chemical releases crude oil releases including maritime releases releases into navigable waters and groundwater contamination material or mechanical failure industrial accidents physical attacks abnormally pressured or structured formations and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates coastal operations are particularly susceptible to disruption from extreme weather events any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of 



 

 

thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses in addition under certain circumstances we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of properties that we own lease or operate as a result we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities for environmental matters for which we do not have insurance coverage which could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration development or acquisitions or cause us to incur losses 

cyberattacks could negatively affect occidental 

the oil and gas industry is increasingly dependent on digital and industrial control technologies to conduct certain exploration development and production activities occidental relies on digital and industrial control systems related infrastructure technologies and networks to run its business and to control and manage its oil and gas chemicals marketing and pipeline operations use of the internet cloud services mobile communication systems and other public networks exposes occidental’s business and that of other third parties with whom occidental does business to cyberattacks cyberattacks on businesses have escalated in recent years 

information and industrial control technology system failures network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results resulting in the unintentional disclosure of company partner customer employee information or damage to our reputation a cyberattack involving our information or industrial control systems and related infrastructure or that of our business associates could negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways including but not limited to the following 



  

our products or a potential environmental hazard and ultimately loss of revenue 

 

even though occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of a cyberattack that it believes are reasonable there can be no assurance that such cyber security measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches of its systems from occurring and if a breach occurs it may remain undetected for an extended period of time further occidental has no control over the comparable systems of the third parties with whom it does business while occidental has experienced cyberattacks in the past occidental has not suffered any material losses however if in the future occidentals cyber security measures are compromised or prove insufficient the potential consequences to occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant as cyberattacks continue to evolve in magnitude and sophistication occidental may be required to expend additional resources in order to continue to enhance occidentals cyber security measures and to investigate and remediate any digital and operational systems related infrastructure technologies and network security vulnerabilities which would increase our costs a system failure or data security breach or a series of such failures or breaches could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

occidentals oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect occidentals business 

producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors unless occidental conducts successful exploration or development activities acquires properties containing proved reserves or both proved reserves will generally decline and negatively impact our business the value of our securities and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace reserves that are depleted by production or replace our declining production with new production management expects improved recovery extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors such as geology government regulations and permits the effectiveness of development plans and the ability to make the necessary capital investments or acquire capital are partially or fully outside managements control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations

occidentals oil and gas assets are located in some of the world’s highestmargin basins and are characterized by an advantaged mix of short and longcycle highreturn development opportunities in the united states occidental continues to hold a leading position in the permian basin other core operations are in the middle east oman uae and qatar and latin america colombia occidentals midstream and marketing business provides flow assurance and access to domestic and international markets oxychem is a worldclass chemical business that generates high financial returns 

strategy 

general 

occidental is focused on delivering a unique shareholder value proposition through continual enhancements to its asset quality organizational capability and innovative technical applications that provide competitive advantages occidental’s integrated business provides conventional and unconventional opportunities through which to grow value occidental aims to maximize shareholder returns through a combination of 

 occidental conducts its operations with a focus on sustainability health safety and environmental and social responsibility capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner occidental accepts commodity engineering and limited exploration risks occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks 

price volatility is inherent in the oil and gas business and occidental’s strategy is to position the business to thrive in an up or downcycle commodity price environment in 2018 occidental continued to build upon its integrated portfolio of highvalue investment options focusing on value growth and highquality assets that deliver industryleading returns during the year 

 

occidental completed its shortterm strategic plan to maintain production and sustain the dividend at a west texas intermediate wti oil price of 40 per barrel and grow production at 5 to 8 percent at 50 per barrel achieving these goals in the shortterm strengthens occidentals ability to provide a meaningful dividend with growth and maintain a strong balance sheet at low oil prices occidentals board of directors and management are committed to allocating free cash flow toward investments that generate the highest returns along with returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 

the following describes the application of occidental’s overall strategy for each of its operating segments 

oil and gas 

occidental’s oil and gas segment focuses on longterm value creation and leadership in sustainability health safety and the environment in each core operating area occidentals operations benefit from scale technical expertise environmental and safety leadership and commercial and governmental collaboration these attributes allow occidental to bring additional production quickly to market extend the life of older fields at lower costs and provide lowcost returns driven growth opportunities with advanced technology 

as a result of occidentals strategic positioning occidentals assets provide current production and a future portfolio of projects that are flexible and have shortcycle investment paybacks together with occidentals technical capabilities the oil and gas segment is able to achieve low development and operating costs to obtain fullcycle value while promoting innovative ideas that differentiate occidentals approach and provide future opportunities 

the oil and gas business implements occidentals strategy primarily by 

 in 2018 oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately 44 billion and were primarily focused on 

  

occidentals highreturn assets in the permian basin oman and colombia 

chemical 

the primary objective of oxychem is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve abovecostofcapital returns the chemical segments strategy is to be a lowcost producer in order to maximize cash flow generation oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with the coproduction of caustic soda and chlorine caustic soda and chlorine are marketed to external customers in addition chlorine together with ethylene is converted through a series of intermediate products into polyvinyl chloride pvc oxychems focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chloralkali and pvc businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities in 2018 oxychem through a 5050 joint venture with mexichem sab de cv achieved a full year of commercial operations of its 12 billion poundperyear ethylene cracker at the oxychem ingleside facility the joint venture provides an opportunity to capitalize on the advantage that us shale gas development has presented to us chemical producers by providing lowcost ethane as a raw material the joint venture provides oxychem with an ongoing source of ethylene significantly reducing oxychems reliance on thirdparty ethylene suppliers oxychem also achieved a full year of operations of its expansion at geismar louisiana following plant startup late in the fourth quarter of 2017 using an oxychem patented process the new facility produces 4cpe a new raw material used in making nextgeneration climatefriendly refrigerants with a low global warming and ozone depletion potential in 2018 capital expenditures for oxychem totaled 271 million 

midstream and marketing 

the midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing the use of its committed pipeline and export capacities and by providing access to domestic and international markets to generate returns the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to occidental subsidiaries as well as third parties the midstream and marketing segment operates gathering systems gas plants cogeneration facilities and storage facilities and invests in entities that conduct similar activities also within the midstream and marketing segment is oxy low carbon ventures olcv olcv seeks to capitalize on occidental’s eor leadership by developing carbon capture utilization and storage projects that source anthropogenic carbon dioxide and promote innovative technologies that drive cost efficiencies and economically grow occidental’s business while reducing emissions 

 

this segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas power and other commodities used in occidentals various businesses capital is employed to sustain or expand assets to improve the competitiveness of occidentals businesses in 2018 capital expenditures related to the midstream business totaled 216 million primarily related to permian basin gas processing and the ingleside crude terminal prior to its sale 

in 2018 occidental sold several assets including the centurion common carrier oil pipeline and storage system southeast new mexico oil gathering system and ingleside crude terminal following the transactions occidental retained its longterm flow assurance pipeline takeaway and export capacity through its retained marketing business 

key performance indicators 

occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return in addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics 

 

oil and gas segment 

business environment 

oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s financial performance the following table presents the average daily west texas intermediate wti brent and new york mercantile exchange nymex prices for 2018  and 2017  



the following table presents occidentals average realized prices as a percentage of wti brent and nymex for 2018  and 2017  



  

average wti and brent oil price indexes increased 27 percent and 30 percent from 5095 and 5482 in 2017  to 6477 and 7153 in 2018  respectively average worldwide realized oil prices rose 1171 or 24 percent in 2018 compared to 2017 wti and brent oil price indexes decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018  closing at 4541 per barrel and 5380 per barrel respectively which is lower than 2017 yearend prices which closed at 6042 per barrel and 6687 per barrel respectively the average realized domestic natural gas price in 2018  decreased 31 percent from 2017  average nymex natural gas prices decreased 4 percent from 309 in 2017  to 297 in 2018  

prices and differentials can vary significantly even on a shortterm basis making it difficult to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty 

business review 

domestic interests 

occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns occidentals domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years which is extended through the end of production once it commences of the total 36 million net acres in which occidental has interests approximately 82 percent is leased 17 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights

permian basin 

the permian basin extends throughout west texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states accounting for more than 30 percent of the total united states oil production 

occidental manages its permian basin operations through two business units permian resources which includes growthoriented unconventional opportunities and permian eor which utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques such as co 2  floods and waterfloods occidental has a leading position in the permian basin producing approximately 10 percent of the total oil in the basin by exploiting the natural synergies between permian resources and permian eor occidental is able to deliver unique short and longterm advantages efficiencies and expertise across its permian basin operations occidental expects to decrease its permian basin fullcycle breakeven costs while continuing to expand its highquality lowcost breakeven inventory occidental expects the combined technical advancements infrastructure utilization opportunities and operations across over 27 million net acres will provide sustainability of occidentals low cost position in the permian basin 

in the next few years growth within occidental’s permian basin portfolio will be focused in the permian resources unconventional assets in 2018 occidental spent approximately 35 billion of capital in the permian basin of which over 85 percent was spent on permian resources assets in 2019 occidental expects to allocate approximately 56 percent of its worldwide 2019 capital budget to permian resources for development and approximately 12 percent to permian eor for the expansion of existing facilities to increase co 2  production and injection capacity 

permian resources 

permian resources unconventional oil development projects provide very shortcycle investment payback 

  

averaging less than two years providing some of the highest margin and returns of any oil and gas projects in the world these investments provide better cashflow and production growth while increasing longterm value and sustainability through higher return on capital employed 

occidentals permian resources inventory includes over 10400 horizontal drilling locations in the midland and delaware subbasins as of december 31 2018 approximately 1000 of these drilling locations represented proved undeveloped reserves in 2018 permian resources produced approximately 214000 net boe per day from approximately 5280 net wells of which 18 percent are operated by other companies 

permian eor 

the permian basin’s concentration of large conventional reservoirs favorable co 2  flooding performance and the proximity to naturally occurring co 2  supply has resulted in decades of steady growth in enhanced oil production with 34 active floods and over 40 years of experience occidental is the industry leader in permian basin co 2 flooding which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10 to 25 percent technology improvements such as the recent trend toward vertical expansion of the co 2  flooded interval into residual oil zone targets continue to yield more recovery from existing projects occidental utilizes workover rigs to drill extra depth into additional co 2  floodable sections of the reservoir and completed 118 well workovers in 2018 and has plans to complete 104 well workovers in 2019 in 2018 permian eor added 26 million boe to occidental’s proved reserves for improved recovery additions primarily as a result of executing co 2  flood development projects and expansions occidentals share of production from permian eor was approximately 154000 boe per day in 2018 

significant opportunities also remain to gain additional recovery by expanding occidentals existing co 2  projects into new portions of reservoirs that have only been waterflooded permian eor has a large inventory of future co 2  projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated depending on market conditions 

international interests 

productionsharing contracts 

occidentals interests in oman and qatar are subject to production sharing contracts psc under such contracts occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain development and production costs and an additional share for profit in addition certain contracts in colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher

in june 2018 occidental and ecopetrol agreed to enter into the second phase of development of the teca heavy oil field based on the positive results of the teca steam flood pilot which began in early 2016 phase ii drilling is expected to start in 2019 

occidental also entered into agreements to develop blocks 39 and 52 in the llanos norte basin and farmed into an additional four blocks in the putumayo basin these blocks increased occidental’s net acreage in colombia to approximately 1 million acres 

occidentals net share of production from colombia was 31000 boe per day in 2018  

proved reserves 

proved oil ngl and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements oil ngl and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity quality and transportation costs for the 2018  2017   and   2016  disclosures the calculated average west texas intermediate oil prices were 6556 5134 and 4275 per barrel respectively the calculated average brent oil prices for 2018  2017   and   2016  disclosures were 7220 5493 and 4449 per barrel respectively the calculated average henry hub gas prices for 2018  2017   and   2016  were 310 308 and 255 per mmbtu respectively 

occidental had proved reserves at yearend 2018  of 2752 million boe compared to the yearend 2017  amount of 2598 million boe proved reserves at yearend 2018  and 2017  consisted of respectively 57 percent and 58 

  

percent oil 18 percent and 17 percent ngl and 25 percent and 25 percent natural gas proved developed reserves represented approximately 73 percent and 74 percent respectively of occidental’s total proved reserves at yearend 2018  and 2017  

occidental does not have any reserves from nontraditional sources for further information regarding occidentals proved reserves see supplemental oil and gas information following the financial statements 

changes in proved reserves 

occidentals total proved reserves increased 154 million boe in 2018  which included additions of 301 million boe from occidentals development program 

changes in reserves were as follows 



occidentals ability to add reserves other than through purchases depends on the success of improved recovery extension and discovery projects each of which depends on reservoir characteristics technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices as well as capital and operating costs many of these factors are outside management’s control and may negatively or positively affect occidentals reserves 

revisions of previous estimates 

revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic production decline or operating performance data in addition product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental for example lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves particularly for domestic properties because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations offsetting this effect lower prices increase occidentals share of proved reserves under pscs because more oil is required to recover costs conversely when prices rise occidentals share of proved reserves decreases for pscs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations in 2018 occidental had positive revisions of 56 million boe mainly in the permian basin and al hosn gas 

reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data 

improved recovery 

in 2018  occidental added proved reserves of 294 million boe mainly associated with the permian basin these properties comprise both conventional projects which are characterized by the deployment of eor 

 

development methods largely employing application of co 2 flood waterflood or steam flood and unconventional projects these types of conventional eor development methods can be applied through existing wells though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells the use of either co 2  or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation the evaluation of engineering data availability and cost of either co 2  or steam and other economic factors both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells many of occidentals projects including unconventional projects rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells in addition some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells 

extensions and discoveries 

occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs in 2018  extensions and discoveries added 7 million boe related primarily to the recognition of proved developed reserves in colombia and oman 

purchases of proved reserves 

occidental continues to seek opportunities to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable as market conditions change the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly 

in 2018 occidental purchased 54 million boe of proved reserves in the permian basin which mainly came from acquisitions made in the third quarter of 2018 

sales of proved reserves 

in 2018 occidental sold 17 million boe in proved reserves mainly related to noncore permian acreage 

proved undeveloped reserves 

occidental had proved undeveloped reserves at yearend 2018 of 750 million boe compared to the yearend 2017 amount of 670 million boe 

changes in proved undeveloped reserves were as follows 



occidental incurred approximately 11 billion in 2018 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves permian basin added approximately 

  

146 million boe through improved recovery purchases and revisions 

the 2018 additions to proved undeveloped reserves were partially offset by 121 million boe of transfers to proved developed reserves mainly from the permian basin and sales of proved undeveloped reserves related to noncore permian acreage 

occidental’s highestreturn projects and most active development areas are located in the permian basin which represented 68 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 2018 the majority of occidental’s 2019 capital program of 45 billion is allocated to the development program in the permian basin overall occidental plans to spend approximately 95 billion over the next five years to develop its proved undeveloped reserves in the permian basin 

occidental’s proved undeveloped reserves in international locations are associated with approved longterm international development projects 

reserves evaluation and review process 

occidentals estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of december 31 2018  were made by occidental’s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management the estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by occidental to develop the reserves this process involves reservoir engineers geoscientists planning engineers and financial analysts as part of the proved reserves estimation process all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates operating costs and capital expenditures price differentials between benchmark prices the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods including estimates from decline curve analysis type curve analysis material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance these reliable fieldtested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities 

net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor 

net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion proved undeveloped reserves are supported by a fiveyear detailed fieldlevel development plan which includes the timing location and capital commitment of the wells to be 

 

drilled the development plan is reviewed and approved annually by senior management and technical personnel annually a detailed review is performed by occidental’s worldwide reserves group and its technical personnel on a leasebylease basis to assess whether proved undeveloped reserves are being converted on a timely basis within five years from the initial disclosure date any leases not showing timely transfers from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves are reviewed by senior management to determine if the remaining reserves will be developed in a timely manner and have sufficient capital committed in the development plan only proved undeveloped reserves that are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan a portion of the proved developed reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved longterm development plans 

the current senior vice president reserves for oxy oil and gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates in compliance with us securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations including the internal audit and review of occidentals oil and gas reserves data he has over 35 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business and has held various assignments in north america asia and europe he is a threetime past chair of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee he is an american association of petroleum geologists aapg certified petroleum geologist and currently serves on the aapg committee on resource evaluation he is a member of the society of petroleum evaluation engineers the colorado school of mines potential gas committee and the unece expert group on resource classification he has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in geology from emory university in atlanta 

occidental has a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee consisting of senior corporate officers to review and approve occidentals oil and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidentals board of directors during the year since 2003 occidental has retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum engineering consultants to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes 

in 2018  ryder scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of december 31 2018  in accordance with the sec regulatory standards ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of occidental’s 2018  yearend total proved reserves portfolio in 2018  ryder scott reviewed approximately 20 percent of occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves since being engaged in 2003 ryder scott has reviewed the specific application of occidental’s 

  

reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 80 percent of occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves management retains ryder scott to provide objective thirdparty input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by occidental occidental has filed ryder scotts independent report as an exhibit to this form 10k 

based on its reviews including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current sec regulations 

industry outlook 

the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions wti and brent oil price indexes increased throughout a majority of 2018 relative to 2017 but decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2018 closing at 4541 per barrel and 5380 per barrel respectively as of december 31 2018  

oil prices will continue to be affected by i global supply and demand which are generally a function of global economic conditions inventory levels production disruptions technological advances regional market conditions and the actions of opec other significant producers and governments ii transportation capacity infrastructure constraints and costs in producing areas iii currency exchange rates and iv the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions 

ngl prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock in addition infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region 

domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas 

these and other factors make it difficult to predict the future direction of oil ngl and domestic gas prices reliably for purposes of the current capital plan occidental will continue to focus on allocating capital to its highestreturn assets with the flexibility to adjust based on fluctuations in commodity prices international gas prices are generally fixed under longterm contracts occidental continues to adjust capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital 

 

chemical segment 

business environment 

in 2018 united states economic growth surpassed that of 2017 and was supported by flat to marginally lower natural gas pricing and lower ethylene costs as compared to the prior year although the average cost of natural gas in 2018 was essentially flat with 2017 prices did escalate in december 2018 ethylene prices trended downward in the first half of 2018 before increasing in the second half with the total year average coming below that of 2017 the impact of lower to flat energy and feedstock costs along with continued strong demand for caustic and pvc resulted in higher margins for both products in 2018 

business review 

basic chemicals 

in 2018 the united states economic growth rate estimated to be 29 percent exceeded the 22 percent experienced in 2017 the higher us growth rate supported domestic demand as the 2018 industry chlorine operating rate increased slightly to 89 percent resulting in an improvement in chlorine pricing in the second quarter of 2018 which was sustained throughout the second half of 2018 exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain improved in 2018 as united states ethylene and energy costs remained advantaged over global pricing liquid caustic soda prices improved both domestically and globally in 2018 as stable demand and tighter supply supported the higher pricing 

vinyls 

demand for pvc in 2018 improved yearoveryear in total as domestic demand remained flat with 2017 while export demand increased by 10 percent domestic demand was supported by construction as housing starts continued to moderately improve yearoveryear export demand growth was driven by emerging economy growth and competitive north american feedstock costs export volume remains a significant portion of pvc sales representing over 30 percent of total north american producer’s production pvc industry operating rates increased over 2 percent compared to 2017 industry pvc margins improved in 2018 due to lower ethylene prices 

industry outlook 

industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy specifically in the housing construction automotive and durable goods markets margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices strengthening in the petroleum industry may positively affect the demand and pricing of a number of occidental’s products that are consumed by industry participants us commodity export markets will continue to be impacted by the relative strength of the us dollar 

basic chemicals 

continued improvement in the united states housing automotive and durable goods markets should drive a moderate increase in domestic demand for basic chemical products in 2019 export demand for caustic is also 

  

expected to remain firm if not improved in 2019 chloralkali operating rates should improve moderately with higher demand and continued competitive energy and raw material pricing as compared to global feedstock costs businesses such as calcium chloride and muriatic acid should improve as oil and gas drilling activity increases in the us 

vinyls 

north american demand should show moderate improvement in 2019 over 2018 levels as growth in construction spending continues with further upside potential driven by new infrastructure projects north american operating rates are expected to remain relatively flat with 2018 and margins should maintain current levels based on strong overall demand and favorable ethylene costs 

midstream and marketing segment 

business environment 

midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its various businesses including its marketing gathering and transportation gas processing and powergeneration assets the marketing business aggregates markets and stores occidentals and thirdparty volumes marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs gas processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segments plants and pipelines as well as the margins obtained on related services 

in september 2018 occidental divested noncore midstream assets for total consideration of 26 billion of which approximately 24 billion was received at closing resulting in a pretax net gain of 907 million these assets included the centurion common carrier oil pipeline and storage system southeast new mexico oil gathering system and ingleside crude terminal excluding the gain the midstream and marketing earnings in 2018 were significantly higher than those in 2017 due to the improvement in the midlandtogulfcoast spreads as well as higher gas plant income due to higher domestic ngl prices and higher sulfur prices at al hosn gas 

business review 

marketing 

the marketing group markets substantially all of occidental’s oil ngl and gas production as well as trades around its assets including contracted transportation and storage capacity occidental’s thirdparty marketing activities focus on purchasing oil ngl and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets these purchases allow occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets marketing performance in 2018 improved compared to 2017 as a result of higher marketing margins from improved crude oil price spreads 

 

pipeline 

in 2018 occidental sold several assets including the centurion common carrier oil pipeline and storage system southeast new mexico oil gathering system and ingleside crude terminal following the transactions occidental retained its longterm flow assurance pipeline takeaway and export capacity through its retained marketing business 

subsequent to the sale of the centurion common carrier oil pipeline and storage system occidentals pipeline business mainly consists of an 11 percent interest in the general partner which owns approximately 40 percent of plains all american pipeline lp and dolphin energy dolphin energy owns and operates a 230milelong 48inchdiameter natural gas pipeline dolphin pipeline which transports dry natural gas from qatar to the uae and oman the dolphin pipeline contributes significantly to occidentals pipeline transportation results through occidentals 245percent interest in dolphin energy the dolphin pipeline has capacity to transport up to 32 bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 22 bcf per day and up to 25 bcf per day in the summer 

gas processing plants and co 2  fields and facilities 

occidental processes its and thirdparty domestic wet gas to extract ngl and other gas byproducts including co 2  and delivers dry gas to pipelines margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for ngl 

occidental also has a 40percent participating interest in al hosn gas which is designed to process 13 bcf per day of natural gas and separate it into sales gas condensate ngl and sulfur in 2018 the facilities produced approximately 11500 metric tons per day of sulfur of which approximately 4600 metric tons was occidentals share al hosn gas facilities generate revenues from gas processing fees and the sale of sulfur the increase in 2018 earnings compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher domestic ngl prices and volumes and higher sulfur prices in connection with al hosn gas sulfur sales 

power generation facilities 

earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties 

low carbon ventures 

also within the midstream and marketing segment is olcv olcv seeks to capitalize on occidental’s eor leadership by developing carbon capture utilization and storage projects that source anthropogenic carbon dioxide and promote innovative technologies that drive cost efficiencies and economically grow occidental’s business while reducing emissions 

industry outlook 

marketing results can experience significant volatility depending on commodity price changes and the midlandtogulfcoast spreads permian takeaway capacity is expected to increase as a result of several new thirdparty pipelines which are expected to be completed in 2019 and in subsequent years which will reduce the midlandtogulf 

  

coast spreads the power generation business is expected to remain relatively stable gas processing plant operations depend primarily on ngl prices generally higher ngl prices result in higher profitability 

segment results of operations and significant items affecting earnings 

segment earnings exclude income taxes interest income interest expense environmental remediation expenses unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments equity investments seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in occidentals consolidated quarterly earnings during the year 

the following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items 



 

 

oil and gas 



   



domestic oil and gas results were earnings of 621 million in 2018 and losses of 589 million and 16 billion in 2017 and 2016 respectively excluding significant items affecting results domestic oil and gas results in 2018 increased from 2017 due to an 18 percent increase in average domestic realized oil prices 22 percent higher volumes and lower dda rates 

  

 excluding significant items affecting results domestic oil and gas results in 2017 increased from 2016 due to a 22 percent increase in average domestic realized oil prices and lower dda rates 

international oil and gas earnings were 19 billion 18 billion and 965 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively excluding significant items affecting results the improved international oil and gas earnings in 2018 compared to 2017 reflected a 34 and 33 percent increase in realized crude oil prices in the middle east and colombia respectively the improved 2017 earnings excluding significant items reflected a 32 and 20 percent increase in realized crude oil and ngl prices in the middle east respectively 

average production costs for 2018 excluding taxes other than on income were 1198 per boe compared to 1173 per boe for 2017 the increase in average production costs per boe reflected increased surface operations and maintenance costs permian resources production costs per boe for 2018 decreased by 10 percent from the prior year and the fourth quarter of 2018 costs were below 700 per boe due to continued improved operational efficiencies 

average production costs for 2017 excluding taxes other than on income were 1173 per boe compared to 1076 per boe for 2016 the increase in average production costs per boe reflected the sales of low margin noncore gas assets which had low operating costs including south texas and piceance basin 

the following table sets forth the production volumes of oil ngl and natural gas per day from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2018  



 

 

average daily production volumes were 658000 boe and 602000 boe for 2018 and 2017 respectively and included production from assets sold or exited of 8000 boe for 2017 the increase in production for ongoing operations mainly reflected higher permian resources production which increased by 52 percent from the prior year due to developmental drilling activity and improved well performance 

average daily production volumes were 602000 boe and 630000 boe for 2017 and 2016 respectively and included production from assets sold or exited of 8000 boe and 55000 boe for 2017 and 2016 respectively excluding production for assets sold or exited average daily production volumes were 594000 boe and 575000 boe for 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase in production mainly reflected higher permian resources production which increased by 14 percent from 2016 to 2017 

chemical 



 

chemical segment earnings were 12 billion 822 million and 571 million for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively excluding significant items affecting results the yearoveryear increase in 2018 earnings was due to significant improvements in realized caustic soda pricing strong margins and demand across many product lines and lower ethylene costs slightly offset by decreased caustic soda export volumes the 2018 earnings also benefited from the fullyear equity contributions from the joint venture ethylene cracker in ingleside texas and additional earning contributions from the geismar louisiana plant expansion to produce 4cpe 

excluding significant items affecting results the yearoveryear increase in 2017 earnings compared to 2016 was the result of higher realized pricing for caustic soda improved vinyl margins higher sales volumes across most product lines and the addition of equity income from the joint venture ethylene cracker in ingleside texas 

  

midstream and marketing 



 

midstream and marketing segment results were earnings of 28 billion and 85 million and a loss of 381 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively excluding significant items affecting results approximately 85 percent of the increase in 2018 results compared to 2017 reflected higher marketing margins due to improved midlandtogulfcoast spreads approximately 10 percent of the increase reflected higher gas plant income due to higher domestic ngl prices and higher sulfur prices in connection with al hosn gas sulfur sales 

excluding significant items affecting results the increase in 2017 results compared to 2016 reflected higher marketing margins due to improved spreads higher plant income due to higher ngl prices and higher income from a full year of operating the ingleside crude terminal 

corporate 

there were no significant corporate transactions and events affecting 2018 and 2017 results significant corporate transactions and events affecting 2016 earnings included charges of 541 million related to a reserve for doubtful accounts 78 million loss on the distribution of the remaining crc stock and gains related to the ecuador settlement see note 2 of the consolidated financial statements 

taxes 

tax cuts and jobs act tax reform was enacted in december 2017 and made significant changes to the us federal income tax law in accordance with guidance from the sec occidental recorded provisional estimates with regards to federal and state taxes associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation and resulting impact on the net federal deferred tax liability with regards to the global intangible lowtax income gilti and base erosion antiabuse tax beat provisions of the new law occidental recorded no tax liability on a provisional basis during 2018 further analysis was completed and additional regulatory guidance was published which led occidental to revise its initial provisional estimates resulting in a 25 million tax benefit being recorded in 2018 specifically the regulatory 

 

guidance related to the allocation of expenses between the net operating losses generated in 2017 and the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings from certain usowned international corporations that was included in 2017 taxable income tax reform also included new limitations on the ability of corporations to deduct interest expense while these limitations did not adversely impact occidental in 2018 under proposed regulations the limitations could significantly impact occidentals ability to deduct interest expense in future years 

deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets of 13 billion were 907 million at december 31 2018  the deferred tax assets net of allowances are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences 

worldwide effective tax rate 

the following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations 



in 2018 occidentals worldwide effective tax rate was 26 percent which is higher than the 2017  rate mainly due to the 2017 remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities to the new federal corporate income tax rate excluding the impact of impairments asset sales and other nonrecurring items occidentals worldwide effective tax rate for 2018 would be 25 percent 

the decrease in worldwide effective tax rate from 2016 to 2017 was due primarily to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities to the new federal corporate income tax rate in 2017 

consolidated results of operations 

changes in components of occidentals results of continuing operations are discussed below 

revenue and other income items 



  

price and volume changes generally represent the majority of the change in the oil and gas and chemical segments sales midstream and marketing sales are mainly impacted by the change in the midlandtogulfcoast spread for the marketing business and to a lesser extent the change in ngl and sulfur prices for the gas processing business 

the increase in net sales in 2018  compared to 2017  was mainly due to higher crude oil prices and higher domestic crude oil volumes as well as higher marketing margins in the midstream and marketing segment due to improved midlandtogulfcoast spreads and higher realized caustic soda prices in the chemical segment average worldwide realized oil prices rose approximately 24 percent from 2017 to 2018 

the increase in net sales in 2017 compared to 2016 was mainly due to the increase in average worldwide realized oil and ngl prices as well as higher realized prices for caustic soda in the chemical business average worldwide realized oil prices rose approximately 26 percent from 2016 to 2017 

the 2018 gain on sale included the sale of noncore domestic midstream assets including the centurion common carrier pipeline and storage system southeast new mexico oil gathering system and ingleside crude terminal of 907 million 

the 2017 gain on sale included the sale of south texas and noncore proved and unproved permian acreage the 2016 gain on sale included the sales of piceance and south texas oil and gas properties the occidental tower building in dallas and a noncore specialty chemicals business 

expense items 



cost of sales increased in 2018 from the prior year primarily due to higher oil and gas production costs for surface operations and maintenance due to increased activity in the permian basin and thirdparty crude purchases used to fill committed transportation capacity in the marketing business cost of sales increased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to increases in chemical feedstock and energy costs and higher oil and gas purchase injectants 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher environmental remediation costs and higher compensation costs selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the change in timing of incentive compensation awards 

  

 

taxes other than on income increased in 2018 from 2017 due primarily to higher production taxes which are directly tied to higher commodity prices taxes other than on income in 2017 increased from 2016 due primarily to higher oil ngl and natural gas prices which resulted in higher production taxes 

dda expense decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to lower domestic dda rates due to higher reserves partially offset by higher production volumes and higher dda rates in the middle east dda expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower volumes and lower dda rates 

in 2018 occidental incurred impairment and related charges of approximately 416 million on proved oil and gas properties and inventory in qatar due to the decline in crude oil prices in 2017 occidental incurred impairment and related items charges of 545 million of which 397 million related to proved and unproved noncore permian acreage and 120 million for idled midstream assets in 2016 occidental incurred impairment and related items charges of 825 million of which 541 million related to a reserve for doubtful accounts and 160 million related to the termination of crude oil supply contracts 78 million related to the disposal of crc stock and 61 million related to exits from libya and iraq the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during 2016 includes a reserve against the longterm receivable related to environmental sites indemnified by maxus described in note 9 environmental liabilities and expenditures occidental recorded a reserve against this receivable due to the uncertainty of collection as a result of the maxus bankruptcy 

  

other items 



provision for income taxes increased in 2018 from 2017 due to tax reform in 2017 and a higher pretax income in 2018 occidental recorded an income tax expense in 2017 as opposed to an income tax benefit recorded in 2016 due to higher pretax operating income as a result of a recovery in commodity prices partially offset by the deferred tax benefit from tax reform 

excluding the 2017 noncash fair value gain income from equity investments increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to a full year of operations from the oxychem ingleside facility income from equity investments in 2017 reflected a 94 million noncash fair value gain on the plains equity investment the increase in income from equity investments in 2017 from 2016 is the result of the oxychem ingleside facility beginning operations in the first quarter of 2017 and a noncash fair value gain on the plains equity investment 

there were no charges for discontinued operations in 2018 and 2017 discontinued operations net in 2016 of 428 million primarily include settlement payments by the republic of ecuador see note 2 of the consolidated financial statements 

  

consolidated analysis of financial position 

the changes in select components of occidental’s balance sheet are discussed below 



assets 

see liquidity and capital resources — cash flow analysis for discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 

the increase in trade receivables net was primarily due to higher crude oil sales volumes at the end of 2018 compared to the end of 2017 the increase in inventories in 2018 primarily reflected higher international crude inventories the increase in investments in unconsolidated entities is primarily due to capital contributions to the cactus ii pipeline the increase in property plant and equipment net ppe was primarily due to oil and gas capital additions and acquisitions which were partially offset by depletion and the sales of noncore domestic midstream assets the decrease in longterm receivables and other assets net is primarily due to a 153 million reduction of the alternative minimum tax receivable 

liabilities 

current maturities of longterm debt represented the 116 million of 925percent senior notes due 2019 

the increase in accounts payable reflected higher oil and gas capital spending compared to the prior year due to increased activity in the permian basin and higher marketing payables as a result of higher crude oil prices and thirdparty purchases the decrease in accrued liabilities reflected lower marktomarket derivative liabilities due to lower commodity prices at year end 

 

the increase in longterm debt net is a result of the issuance of 10 billion of 42percent senior notes due 2048 

the increase in deferred domestic and foreign income tax liabilities net was primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards the decrease in pension and postretirement obligations was primarily due to the adoption a postretirement benefit plan design change which decreased the obligation by 178 million with a corresponding offset to accumulated other comprehensive income 

  

stockholders equity 

the increase in treasury stock reflected the purchase of 13 billion of treasury stock in 2018 the increase in retained earnings reflected net income of 41 billion partially offset by the distribution of 24 billion of cash dividends dividends per share were 310 for the year ended december 31 2018 the increase in additional paid in capital is the result of share issuances resulting from occidentals longterm incentive programs the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss reflected the postretirement benefit plan design change partially offset by the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings of stranded tax effects resulting from the changes to the us federal tax law from the tax reform 

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2018  occidental had approximately 30 billion  in cash and cash equivalents a substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the united states 

occidental utilized the remaining restricted cash balance resulting from the spinoff of california resources in the first quarter of 2016 to retire debt and pay dividends 

in march 2018 occidental issued 10 billion of 42percent senior notes due 2048 occidental received net proceeds of approximately 985 million interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears in march and september of each year beginning on september 15 2018 the proceeds were used to refinance the repayment of the 500 million aggregate principal amount of occidentals 15percent senior notes due in february 2018 with the remainder used for general corporate purposes 

in november 2016 occidental issued 15 billion of senior notes comprised of 750 million of 30percent senior notes due 2027 and 750 million of 41percent senior notes due 2047 occidental received net proceeds of 149 billion interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually in arrears in february and august each year for each series of senior notes occidental used the proceeds for general corporate purposes 

in may and june 2016 respectively occidental utilized part of the proceeds from the april 2016 senior note offering described below to exercise the early redemption option on 125 billion of 175percent senior notes due in the first quarter of 2017 and to retire all 750 million of 4125percent senior notes that matured in june 2016 

  

in april 2016 occidental issued 275 billion of senior notes comprised of 400 million of 26percent senior notes due 2022 115 billion of 34percent senior notes due 2026 and 12 billion of 44percent senior notes due 2046 occidental received net proceeds of approximately 272 billion interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually in arrears in april and october of each year for each series of senior notes occidental used a portion of the proceeds to retire debt in may and june 2016 and used the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes 

in february 2016 occidental retired 700 million of 25percent senior notes that had matured 

in january 2018 occidental entered into a 30 billion revolving credit facility 2018 credit facility which matures in january 2023 to replace the previously undrawn 20 billion revolving credit facility 2014 credit facility which was scheduled to expire in august 2019 borrowings under the 2018 credit facility bear interest at various benchmark rates including libor plus a margin based on occidentals senior debt ratings both credit facilities have similar terms and along with other debt agreements do not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict occidentals ability to borrow or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt repayment the 2018 credit facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur 

 occidental paid average annual facility fees of 008 percent in 2018  on the total commitment amounts of the 2018 credit facility occidental did not draw down any amounts under the 2018 credit facility during 2018 occidental did not draw down any amounts under the 2014 credit facility during 2017 or 2016 

as of december 31 2018  under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on or acquisitions of occidental stock 

occidental expects to fund its liquidity needs including future dividend payments through cash on hand cash generated from operations monetization of noncore assets or investments and through future borrowings and if necessary proceeds from other forms of capital issuance 

cash flow analysis 



 

cash provided by operating activities of 77 billion in 2018 increased 28 billion from 49 billion in 2017 the increase in operating cash flows reflected higher realized worldwide oil and ngl prices which increased by 24 percent and 21 percent respectively as well as a 25 percent increase in domestic oil volumes operating cash flows in 2018 also benefited from higher marketing margins in the midstream and marketing segment due to improved midlandtogulfcoast spreads and higher chemical margins from significant improvements in caustic soda prices 

cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2017 increased 24 billion to 49 billion from 25 billion in 2016 operating cash flows were positively impacted by higher worldwide oil and ngl prices and higher domestic volumes in the oil and gas business and improved margins in the midstream and marketing and chemicals businesses cash flows from continuing operations in 2017 also included 761 million of federal tax refunds 

other cost elements such as labor costs and overhead are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flows than changes in oil and gas product prices sales volumes and operating costs 



occidental’s capital expenditures increased by 14 billion in 2018 to 50 billion the increase was a result of additional capital spending primarily in the permian basin due to its high returns occidental’s capital expenditures increased by approximately 900 million in 2017 to 36 billion occidentals 2019 capital spending is expected to be 45 billion 

in 2018 cash flows provided by other investing activities of 18 billion was comprised primarily of proceeds from the sale of noncore domestic midstream assets partially offset by asset purchases primarily related to the acquisition of a previously leased power and steam cogeneration facility 

in 2017 cash flows provided by other investing activities of 520 million includes proceeds of 14 billion which were primarily related to the sale of noncore permian acreage and occidentals south texas operations partially offset by 11 billion of acquisition costs primarily related to permian properties 

in 2016 cash flows used in other investing activities of 20 billion was comprised primarily of the acquisition of acreage in the permian in october 2016 

  



 cash used by financing activities in 2018 increased 759 million from 23 billion in 2017 to 31 billion in 2018 financing activities in 2018 mainly consisted of dividend payments of 24 billion and purchases of treasury stock of 12 billion financing activities in 2018 also included proceeds from longterm debt of 978 million and payments of longterm debt of 500 million 

cash used by financing activities in 2017 was 23 billion as compared to cash used by financing activities in 2016 of 802 million financing activities in 2017 mainly consist of dividend payments of 23 billion 

cash used by financing activities in 2016 was 802 million financing activities in 2016 included proceeds from longterm debt of 42 billion payments of longterm debt of 27 billion and dividends paid of 23 billion 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of occidentals offbalancesheet arrangements 

guarantees 

occidental has guaranteed its portion of equity method investees debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds letters of credit indemnities and commitments provided by occidental to third parties mainly to provide assurance that opc or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees as of december 31 2018  occidental’s guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately 244 million  of dolphin energys debt 

occidental has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries for various letters of credit indemnities and commitments 

see oil and gas segment — business review — qatar and “segment results of operations” for further information about dolphin 

leases 

occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements mainly for real estate equipment plants and facilities and information technology hardware occidental leases assets when leasing offers greater operating flexibility lease payments are generally expensed as part of cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses for more information see contractual obligations 

contractual obligations 

delivery commitments 

occidental has made commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil natural gas and ngl the total amount contracted to be delivered in the united states is approximately 155 million barrels of oil through 2025 288 bcf of gas through 2029 and 36 million 

 

barrels of ngl through 2028 the price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall 

the table below summarizes and crossreferences occidental’s contractual obligations this summary indicates on and offbalancesheet obligations as of december 31 2018  



 

lawsuits claims and contingencies 

occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property damage or other losses punitive damages civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar federal state local and international environmental laws these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases 

  

compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties and injunctive relief usually occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies further some lawsuits claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a thirdparty or occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction 

in accordance with applicable accounting guidance occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated in note 9 occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental remediation matters that satisfy this criteria reserve balances for matters other than environmental remediation matters that satisfy this criteria as of december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 were not material to occidentals consolidated balance sheet 

in 2016 occidental received payments from the republic of ecuador of approximately 10 billion pursuant to a november 2015 arbitration award for ecuador’s 2006 expropriation of occidentals participation contract for block 15 the awarded amount represented a recovery of 60 percent of the value of block 15 in 2017 andes petroleum ecuador ltd andes filed a demand for arbitration claiming it is entitled to a 40 percent share of the judgment amount obtained by occidental occidental contends that andes is not entitled to any of the amounts paid under the 2015 arbitration award because occidental’s recovery was limited to occidental’s own 60 percent economic interest in the block occidental intends to vigorously defend against this claim in arbitration a hearing on the merits has not been scheduled at this time 

the ultimate outcome and impact of outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings on occidental cannot be predicted management believes that the resolution of these matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on occidentals consolidated balance sheet if unfavorable outcomes of these matters were to occur future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected occidental’s estimates are based on information known about the legal matters and its experience in contesting litigating and settling similar matters occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available 

tax matters 

during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax jurisdictions taxable years through 2016 for united states federal income tax purposes have been audited by the united states internal revenue service irs pursuant to its compliance assurance program and subsequent taxable years are currently under review taxable years through 2009 have been audited for state income tax purposes while a single foreign tax jurisdiction is open for 2002 all 

 

other significant audit matters in foreign jurisdictions have been resolved through 2010 during the course of tax audits disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

indemnities to third parties 

occidental its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2018  occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal state local and international laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality 

the laws that require or address environmental remediation including cercla and similar federal state local and international laws may apply retroactively and regardless of fault the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites opc or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating closed and thirdparty sites remedial activities may include one or more of the following investigation involving sampling modeling risk assessment or monitoring cleanup measures including removal treatment or disposal or operation and maintenance of remedial systems the environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties injunctive relief and government oversight costs 

environmental remediation 

as of december 31 2018  occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 145 sites the following table presents occidental’s current and noncurrent environmental remediation reserves as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities 120 million in 2018 137 million in 2017 and 131 million in 2016 and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities — environmental remediation reserves 762 million in 2018 728 million in 2017 and 739 million in 2016 the reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the us environmental protection agency on the cercla national priorities list npl sites and three categories of nonnpl sites — thirdparty sites occidentaloperated sites and closed or nonoperated occidental sites 

  



  

as of december 31 2018  occidental’s environmental reserves exceeded 10 million  each at 16  of the 145  sites described above and 87  of the sites had reserves from 0  to 1 million  each 

as of december 31 2018  three  sites — the diamond alkali superfund site and a former chemical plant in ohio both of which are indemnified by maxus energy corporation as discussed further below and a landfill in western new york  accounted for 94 percent  of its reserves associated with npl sites the reserve balance above includes 17  npl sites indemnified by maxus 

four  of the 68  thirdparty sites — a maxusindemnified chrome site in new jersey a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee an active plant outside of the united states and an active refinery in louisiana where occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities  accounted for 62 percent  of occidental’s reserves associated with these sites the reserve balance above includes 9 thirdparty sites indemnified by maxus 

four  sites — chemical plants in kansas louisiana new york and texas  accounted for 64 percent  of the reserves associated with the occidentaloperated sites 

five  other sites — a landfill in western new york former chemical plants in tennessee washington and delaware and a closed coal mine in pennsylvania  accounted for 61 percent  of the reserves associated with closed or nonoperated occidental sites 

environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation 

based on current estimates occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at all of its environmental sites could be up to 11 billion 

maxus environmental sites 

when occidental acquired diamond shamrock chemicals company dscc in 1986 maxus a subsidiary of ypf sa ypf agreed to indemnify occidental for a number of environmental sites including the diamond alkali superfund site site along a portion of the passaic river on june 17 2016 maxus and several affiliated companies filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal 

 

district court in the state of delaware prior to filing for bankruptcy maxus defended and indemnified occidental in connection with cleanup and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity including the site 

in march 2016 the epa issued a record of decision rod specifying remedial actions required for the lower 83 miles of the lower passaic river the rod does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river or newark bay during the third quarter of 2016 and following maxus’s bankruptcy filing occidental and the epa entered into an administrative order on consent aoc to complete the design of the proposed cleanup plan outlined in the rod at an estimated cost of 165 million the epa announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties 

occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and the remediation called for in the aoc and the rod as well as for certain other maxusindemnified sites occidentals accrued estimated environmental reserve does not consider any recoveries for indemnified costs occidental’s ultimate share of this liability may be higher or lower than the reserved amount and is subject to final design plans and the resolution of occidentals allocable share with other potentially responsible parties occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the aoc the rod and to perform remediation at other maxusindemnified sites in light of the maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties in june 2018 occidental filed a complaint under cercla in federal district court in the state of new jersey against numerous potentially responsible parties for reimbursement of amounts incurred or to be incurred to comply with the aoc the rod or to perform other remediation activities at the site 

in june 2017 the court overseeing the maxus bankruptcy approved a plan of liquidation plan to liquidate maxus and create a trust to pursue claims against ypf repsol and others to satisfy claims by occidental and other creditors for past and future cleanup and other costs in july 2017 the courtapproved plan became final and the trust became effective among other responsibilities the trust will pursue claims against ypf repsol and others and distribute assets to maxus creditors in accordance with the trust agreement and plan in june 2018 the trust filed its complaint against ypf and repsol in delaware bankruptcy court asserting claims based upon among other things fraudulent transfer and alter ego on february 15 2019 the bankruptcy court denied repsols and ypfs motions to dismiss the complaint 

environmental costs 

operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures relate to longerlived improvements in properties currently operated by occidental remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations 

occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately 157 million for 2019  

  

occidental’s environmental costs some of which include estimates are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended december 31 



international investments 

many of occidental’s assets are located outside north america at december 31 2018  the carrying value of occidental’s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately 89 billion or 20 percent of occidental’s total assets at that date of such assets approximately 76 billion are located in the middle east and approximately 13 billion are located in latin america for the year ended december 31 2018  net sales outside north america totaled 53 billion or approximately 30 percent of total net sales 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires occidentals management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts there has been no material change to occidentals critical accounting policies over the past three years the selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve managements judgment 

oil and gas properties 

the carrying value of occidental’s property plant and equipment ppe represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest net of accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization dda and any impairment charges for assets acquired ppe cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets 

occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method 

 

occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found if proved reserves have been found the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized otherwise occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense in some cases a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12month period after drilling is complete unless it is pending government approval for a development plan in occidentals international locations 

occidental expenses annual lease rentals the costs of injectants used in production and geological geophysical and seismic costs as incurred 

occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unitofproduction method it amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 

several factors could change occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves for example occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices in other cases particularly with longlived properties lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical for such properties higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded 

additionally occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable if there is an indication the carrying 

  

amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices significant changes in reserve estimates changes in managements plans or other significant events management will evaluate the property for impairment under the successful efforts method if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants the impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time these assumptions include estimates of future product prices contractual prices estimates of riskadjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs it is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in additional impairments 

for impairment testing unless prices are contractually fixed occidental uses observable forward strip prices for oil and natural gas prices when projecting future cash flows prices are held constant for periods beyond those covered by forward strip prices future operating and development costs are estimated using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce oil and gas reserves market prices for crude oil natural gas and ngl have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future changes in global supply and demand transportation capacity currency exchange rates and applicable laws and regulations and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions could impact current forecasts future fluctuations in commodity prices could result in estimates of future cash flows to vary significantly 

the most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in occidentals oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the dda rate for example a 5 percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the dda rate by approximately 055 per barrel which would increase or decrease pretax income by approximately 135 million annually at current production rates 

a portion of the carrying value of occidental’s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were 10 billion at both december 31 2018  and 2017 the unproved amounts are not subject to dda until they are classified as proved properties capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to dda when proved reserves are assigned to the property if the exploration efforts are unsuccessful or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices higher development and operating costs contractual conditions or other factors the capitalized costs of the related properties would be 

 

expensed the timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties if warranted depends upon managements plans the nature timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance 

chemical assets 

occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

midstream marketing and other assets 

derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cashflow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment otherwise any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period for cashflow hedges the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income oci with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged realized gains or losses from cashflow hedges and any ineffective portion are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location quality grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of operations there were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 

a hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if at inception and throughout its life it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows respectively of the hedging instrument in the case of hedging a forecast transaction the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable 

fair value measurements 

occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a threelevel fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation techniques level 1 – using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities level 2 – using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities and level 

  

3 – using unobservable inputs transfers between levels if any are recognized at the end of each reporting period 

fair values  recurring 

occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs occidental utilizes the midpoint between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value in addition to using market data occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique for assets and liabilities carried at fair value occidental measures fair value using the following methods 

 Ø overthecounter otc bilateral financial commodity contracts international exchange contracts options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industrystandard models that consider various inputs including quoted forward prices for commodities time value volatility factors credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments as well as other relevant economic measures substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 

 

occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a marketobservable price for an identical or similar asset or liability this approach utilizes managements judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows and discounts those cash flows using a riskadjusted discount rate 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience remedial objectives available technologies applicable laws and regulations 

 

and costsharing arrangements occidental bases environmental reserves on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred using the most costeffective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established the reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established presently none of the environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received or when receipt of recovery is highly probable 

many factors could affect occidental’s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses the most significant are 1 cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate 2 the length of time type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination 3 a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify occidental’s proposed remedial plan 4 improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs 5 laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability and 6 changes in allocation or costsharing arrangements may occur 

certain sites involve multiple parties with various costsharing arrangements which fall into the following three categories 1 environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties 2 oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest or 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of properties in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs in these circumstances occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate when estimating occidentals ultimate share of liability occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and based on these factors believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved 

in addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures which often take in excess of 10 years at npl sites occidentals reserves include managements estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly 

  

if occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings for example if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent occidental would record a pretax gain of 88 million if the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 88 million 

other loss contingencies 

occidental is involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings and audits occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis 

loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate management’s judgments could change based on new information changes in or interpretations of laws or regulations changes in management’s plans or intentions opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings or other factors see lawsuits claims and contingencies for additional information

general 

occidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil ngl and natural gas prices price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect occidental’s pretax annual income by approximately 130 million for a 1 per barrel change in oil prices and 45 million for a 1 per barrel change in ngl prices if domestic natural gas prices varied by 050 per mcf it would have an estimated annual effect on occidentals pretax income of approximately 35 million these pricechange sensitivities include the impact of psc and similar contract volume changes on income if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidental’s results to prices also will change marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil natural gas and to a lesser degree other commodities these sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing volumes and cannot be predicted reliably 

occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices a variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of 10 per ton would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 10 million and 30 million respectively a variation in pvc prices of 001  per lb would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 30 million historically over time product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins the 2018  average contract prices were chlorine344 per ton caustic soda768 per ton and pvc040 per lb 

occidental uses derivative instruments including a combination of shortterm futures forwards options and swaps to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas 

  

risk management 

occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies the controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check members of the risk management group report to the corporate vice president and treasurer controls for these activities include limits on value at risk limits on credit limits on total notional trade value segregation of duties delegation of authority daily price verifications reporting to senior management on various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls 

  

fair value of marketing derivative contracts 

occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value fair values for these contracts are derived from level 1 and level 2 sources the fair values in future maturity periods 

  

are insignificant 

the following table shows the fair value of occidentals derivatives excluding collateral segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation 



  

cashflow hedges 

occidental’s marketing operations from time to time store natural gas purchased from third parties at occidental’s north american leased storage facilities as of december 31 2018 and 2017 occidental had approximately 5  billion cubic feet bcf and 7 bcf of natural gas held in storage respectively and had cashflow hedges for the forecast sales to be settled by physical delivery of approximately 4  bcf and 7  bcf of stored natural gas respectively 

  

quantitative information 

occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities this measure determines the maximum potential negative one day change in fair value with a 95 percent level of confidence additionally occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice as a result of these controls occidental believes that the market risk of its trading  activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance 

  

interest rate risk 

general 

occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variablerate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2018  variablerate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of occidentals total debt 

  

foreign currency risk 

occidental’s international operations have limited currency risk occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes a vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in united states dollars additionally all of occidental’s consolidated international oil and gas subsidiaries have the united states dollar as the functional currency as of december 31 2018  the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the marketing operations was 

 

immaterial the effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income 

tabular presentation of interest rate risk 

the table below provides information about occidentals debt obligations debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date 



 

credit risk 

the majority of occidentals counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants as appropriate occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis 

certain of occidentals otc derivative instruments contain creditriskcontingent features primarily tied to credit ratings for occidental or its counterparties which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post occidental believes that if it had received a onenotch reduction in its credit ratings it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateralposting requirements as of december 31 2018  and 2017  

as of december 31 2018  the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties occidental believes its exposure to creditrelated losses at december 31 2018  was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented

midstream and marketing operations 

general 

occidentals midstream and marketing operations primarily support and enhance its oil and gas and chemicals businesses and also provide similar services for third parties 

in 2017 occidental became the largest exporter of permian light sweet crude from the us gulf coast the export market for crude has developed since the lifting of the export ban in 2016 while us producers have increased production of light crude us refineries are constrained in their ability to process incremental volumes of light crude without significant incremental capital investment necessitating exports to international markets occidental owns and operates a crude oil terminal at ingleside in the port of corpus christi occidental believes it is the premier crude oil terminal on the us gulf coast due to its logistical benefits high loading rate and access to sizable quantities of consistent quality permian crude oil in response to the increase in permian production and the need to export these barrels occidental is expanding its ingleside crude terminal to approximately 750000 barrels per day of capacity and 68 million barrels of storage which is expected to be operational by the end of 2019 occidental is also expanding the facility to be capable of

available information 

occidental makes the following information available free of charge on its website at wwwoxycom 

 information contained on occidentals website is not part of this report 




 item 1a risk factors 

volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidentals financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products particularly oil and to a lesser extent natural gas and ngls and its chemical products 

prices for crude oil natural gas and ngls fluctuate widely historically the markets for crude oil natural gas ngls and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future if the prices of oil natural gas or ngls continue to be volatile reverse their recent increases or decline occidentals operations financial condition cash flows and level of expenditures may be materially and adversely affected 

prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in occidentals control these factors include among others 



 

including available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints in producing areas 

   

the longterm effects of these and other conditions on the prices of crude oil natural gas ngls and refined products are uncertain generally occidentals practice is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities however management may elect to hedge the price risk of crude oil natural gas and ngls in the future 

the prices obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the united states and global economies as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

occidental may experience delays cost overruns losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities 

occidental bears the risks of equipment failures construction delays escalating costs or competition for services materials supplies or labor property or border disputes disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance title problems and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns 

exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses 

governmental actions and political instability may affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s businesses are subject to the decisions of many federal state local and foreign governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 



  

occidentals costs or reduce demand for occidentals products 

 in addition occidental has and may continue to experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability nationalizations corruption armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources 

occidentals oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves 

results of operations reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend in part on occidental’s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves occidental has many competitors including national oil companies some of which i are larger and better funded ii may be willing to accept greater risks or iii have special competencies competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts in addition during periods of low product prices any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts 

occidental’s acquisition activities also carry risks that it may i not fully realize anticipated benefits due to lessthanexpected reserves or production or changed circumstances such as declines in crude oil ngl and gas prices ii bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties iii experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity or iv assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated 

occidental’s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability including production decline rates operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices future operating costs and capital expenditures and assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies the procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants however there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves actual production revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates and the variance may be material if occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected in addition the discounted cash flows included in this form 10k should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted 12month average firstdayofthemonth prices in accordance with sec regulations actual future 

 

prices and costs may differ materially from sec regulationcompliant prices and costs used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves 

concerns about climate change and further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may adversely affect occidental’s operations or results 

continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional and local legislation and regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these and other government actions relating to greenhouse gas emissions could require occidental to incur increased operating and maintenance costs such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for oil natural gas and other products that occidental’s businesses produce any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming and thereby reduce demand for oil natural gas and other products produced by occidental’s businesses consequently government actions designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on occidental’s business financial condition and results of operations in addition increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against occidental which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business 

it is difficult to predict the timing and certainty of such government actions and the ultimate effect on occidental which could depend on among other things the type and extent of greenhouse gas reductions required the availability and price of emissions allowances or credits the availability and price of alternative fuel sources the energy sectors covered and occidental’s ability to recover the costs incurred through its operating agreements or the pricing of the company’s oil natural gas and other products 

occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic events 

the occurrence of events such as hurricanes floods droughts earthquakes or other acts of nature well blowouts fires explosions chemical releases crude oil releases including maritime releases and releases into navigable waters material or mechanical failure industrial accidents physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates coastal operations are particularly susceptible to disruption from extreme weather events thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses 

cyberattacks could significantly affect occidental 

cyberattacks on businesses have escalated in recent years occidental relies on digital systems related infrastructure technologies and networks to run its business and to control and manage its oil and gas chemicals marketing and pipeline operations use of the internet cloud services and other public networks exposes occidental’s business and that of other third parties with whom occidental does business to cyberattacks that attempt to gain unauthorized access to 

  

data and systems release confidential information corrupt data and disrupt critical systems and operations even though occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of a cyberattack that it believes are reasonable there can be no assurance that such cyber security measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches of its systems from occurring further occidental has no control over the comparable systems of the third parties with whom it does business while occidental has experienced cyberattacks in the past occidental has not suffered any material losses however if in the future occidentals cyber security measures are compromised or prove insufficient the potential consequences to occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant as cyberattacks continue to evolve in magnitude and sophistication occidental may be required to expend additional resources in order to continue to enhance occidentals cyber security measures and to investigate and remediate any digital systems related infrastructure technologies and network security vulnerabilities 

occidentals oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect occidentals business 

unless occidental conducts successful exploration or development activities acquires properties containing proved reserves or both proved reserves will generally decline management expects improved recovery extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors such as geology government regulations and permits and the effectiveness of development plans are partially or fully outside managements control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations 

the ultimate impact of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tax reform may differ from occidentals estimates 

tax reform was enacted in december 2017 and made significant changes to the us federal income tax law including lowering the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax amt and mandating a deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings and profits of usowned foreign corporations occidental recorded the effects of the changes in the tax law for which the accounting was complete in accordance with the guidance from the sec occidental recorded a provisional estimate for the federal and state tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation and the resulting impact to the net federal deferred tax liability with regards to the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti and base erosion antiabuse tax beat provisions of the new tax law occidental has recorded no tax liability based on preliminary estimates the ultimate impact of tax reform may differ from occidental’s 

 

estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions as well as additional regulatory guidance occidental will adjust provisional amounts as updated information is evaluated

price volatility is inherent in the oil and gas business and occidental’s strategy is to position the business to thrive in an up or downcycle commodity price environment recent strategic initiatives have resulted in occidental exiting its noncore areas including south texas in 2017 and strengthening its position in areas where occidental has a competitive advantage and an advantaged asset portfolio in 2017 occidental continued to build upon its business including a growing dividend and production growth at low oil prices during the year occidentals board of directors and management implemented a shortterm strategic plan that is intended to maintain production and sustain the dividend at a west texas intermediate wti oil price of 40 per barrel at 50 wti occidental’s plan anticipates that the business will generate additional capital to cover production growth of 5 to 8 percent and fulfill occidentals dividend growth goal this plan has continued into 2018 and longer term occidental will continue to build upon this lowcost highmargin value proposition through development and operation of its focused and advantaged assets 

the following describes the application of occidental’s overall strategy for each of its operating segments 

oil and gas 

occidental’s oil and gas segment focuses on longterm value creation and leadership in health safety and the environment in each core operating area occidentals operations benefit from scale technical expertise environmental and safety leadership and commercial and governmental collaboration these attributes allow occidental to bring additional production quickly to market extend the life of older fields at lower costs and provide lowcost growth opportunities with advanced technology 

as a result of occidentals strategic positioning occidentals assets provide current production and a future portfolio of projects that are flexible have shortcycle investment paybacks deliver a low base decline and provide decades of diverse and unique opportunities to support energy demand across many future scenarios together with occidentals technical capabilities the oil and gas segment is able to achieve low development and operating costs to obtain fullcycle value while promoting innovative ideas that differentiate occidentals approach and provide future opportunities 

the oil and gas business implements occidentals strategy primarily by 



  

 in 2017 oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately 30 billion and were mainly comprised of expenditures in the permian basin and the middle east this activity reflects occidentals strategy to focus on achieving returns well above the cost of capital even in a low price environment 

management believes occidentals oil and gas segment growth will occur primarily through exploitation and development opportunities in the permian basin and colombia and focused international projects in the middle east 

chemical 

the primary objective of oxychem is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve abovecostofcapital returns the chemical segments strategy is to be a lowcost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine which is coproduced with caustic soda and markets both to external customers in addition chlorine together with ethylene is converted through a series of intermediate products into polyvinyl chloride pvc oxychems focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale capital is employed to sustain production capacity in a safe and environmentally sound manner as well as to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chloralkali and pvc businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities in the first quarter of 2017 oxychem through a 5050 joint venture with mexichem sab de cv began commercial operations on a 12 billion poundperyear ethylene cracker at the oxychem ingleside facility the joint venture provides an opportunity to capitalize on the advantage that us shale gas development has presented to us chemical producers by providing lowcost ethane as a raw material the joint venture will provide oxychem with an ongoing source of ethylene significantly reducing oxychems reliance on thirdparty ethylene suppliers in 2017 capital expenditures for oxychem totaled 308 million an additional 39 million was contributed to the mexichem joint venture oxychem completed construction on the previously announced expansion of its manufacturing plant in geismar louisiana on budget and on time in december 2017 the new facility began producing 4cpe a new raw 

 

material used in making nextgeneration climatefriendly refrigerants with a low globalwarming and zero ozonedepletion potential 

  

midstream and marketing 

the midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing the use of its transportation storage and terminal assets and by providing access to domestic and international market alternatives to generate returns the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to occidental subsidiaries as well as third parties the midstream and marketing segment invests in and operates pipeline and gathering systems gas plants cogeneration facilities storage facilities and terminal assets this segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas power and other commodities used in occidentals various businesses capital is employed to sustain or expand facilities in the gathering transportation storage and terminal assets to improve the competitiveness of occidentals businesses in 2017 capital expenditures totaled 284 million related to permian basin gas processing and gathering infrastructure al hosn gas the ingleside crude terminal and expansion of the oil pipeline system in new mexico by an additional 50 miles 

key performance indicators 

occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return in addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics 

 

oil and gas segment 

business environment 

oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s financial performance the following table presents the average daily west texas intermediate wti brent and new york mercantile exchange nymex prices for 2017  and 2016  



  

the following table presents occidentals average realized prices as a percentage of wti brent and nymex for 2017  and 2016  



average wti and brent oil price indexes increased 18 percent and 22 percent from 4332 and 4504 in 2016  to 5095 and 5482 in 2017  respectively average worldwide realized oil prices rose 1020 or 26 percent in 2017 compared to 2016 wti and brent oil price indexes increased in the fourth quarter of 2017  closing at 6042 per barrel and 6687 per barrel respectively well above 2017 average prices the average realized domestic natural gas price in 2017  increased 22 percent from 2016  average nymex natural gas prices increased 28 percent from 242 in 2016  to 309 in 2017  

prices and differentials can vary significantly even on a shortterm basis making it difficult to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty 

operations 

2017 developments 

in the third quarter of 2017 occidental closed on two divestitures of noncore acreage in the permian basin for proceeds of approximately 06 billion resulting in a pretax gain of approximately 81 million concurrently occidental purchased additional ownership interests and assumed operatorship in co 2  enhanced oil recovery eor properties located in the seminolesan andres unit for approximately 06 billion which was primarily allocated to proved property in the fourth quarter of 2017 occidental sold other noncore proved and unproved acreage in the permian basin for approximately 90 million resulting in a pretax gain of approximately 55 million occidental also classified approximately 05 billion in noncore proved and unproved permian acreage to assets held for sale at december 31 2017 

in april 2017 occidental completed the sale of its south texas operations for net proceeds of 05 billion resulting in pretax gain of 05 billion 

business review 

domestic interests 

occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns occidentals domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years which is extended through the end of production once it commences of the total 34 million net acres in which occidental has interests approximately 83 percent is leased 16 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights

permian basin 

the permian basin extends throughout west texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states accounting for more than 20 of the total united states oil production 

occidental manages its permian basin operations through two business units permian resources which includes growthoriented unconventional opportunities and permian eor which utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques such as co 2  floods and waterfloods occidental has a leading position in the permian basin producing 

  

approximately 9 percent of the total oil in the basin by exploiting the natural synergies between permian resources and permian eor occidental is able to deliver unique short and longterm advantages efficiencies and expertise across its permian basin operations occidental can decrease its permian basin fullcycle breakeven costs while continuing to add highquality lowcost breakeven inventory of future drilling locations faster than it is developed the combined technical advancements infrastructure utilization opportunities and operations across over 25 million net acres will provide sustainability of occidentals low cost position in the permian basin 

in the next few years growth within occidental’s permian basin portfolio will be focused in the permian resources unconventional assets in 2017 occidental spent approximately 21 billion of capital in the permian basin of which over 75 percent was spent on permian resources assets in 2018 occidental expects to allocate approximately half of its worldwide 2018 capital budget to permian resources for development and approximately 15 percent to permian eor for the expansion of existing facilities to increase co 2  production and injection capacity 

permian resources 

permian resources unconventional oil development projects provide very shortcycle investment payback averaging less than two years that replaces the lower return production from assets divested during the 20132017 portfolio optimization while also providing some of the highest margin and returns of any oil and gas projects in the world these investments provide better cashflow and production growth while increasing longterm value and sustainability through higher return on capital employed 

occidentals permian resources inventory includes over 11200 horizontal drilling locations in the midland and delaware subbasins as of december 31 2017 approximately 750 of these drilling locations represented proved undeveloped reserves in 2017 permian resources produced approximately 141000 net boe per day from approximately 5050 net wells of which 18 percent are operated by other companies in 2017 permian resources drilled 138 horizontal wells and added 127 million boe from improved recovery to occidentals proved reserves 

permian eor 

the permian basin’s concentration of large conventional reservoirs favorable co 2  flooding performance and the proximity to naturally occurring co 2  supply has resulted in decades of steady growth in enhanced oil production with 34 active floods and over 40 years of experience occidental is the industry leader in permian basin co 2 flooding which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10 to 25 percent technology improvements such as the recent trend toward vertical expansion of the co 2  flooded interval into residual oil zone targets continue to yield more recovery from existing projects occidental utilizes workover rigs to drill extra depth into additional co 2  floodable sections of the reservoir and completed 91 well workovers in 2017 and has plans to complete 100 well workovers in 2018 in 2017 permian eor added 21 million 

 

boe to occidental’s proved reserves for improved recovery additions primarily as a result of executing co 2  flood development projects and expansions occidentals share of production from permian eor was approximately 150000 boe per day in 2017 

significant opportunities also remain to gain additional recovery by expanding occidentals existing co 2  projects into new portions of reservoirs that have only been waterflooded permian eor has a large inventory of future co 2  projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated depending on market conditions 

other domestic 

occidental holds approximately 908000 net acres in other domestic locations occidentals share of production in other domestic locations was approximately 5000 boe per day 

international interests 

productionsharing contracts 

occidentals interests in oman and qatar are subject to production sharing contracts psc under such contracts occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain development and production costs and an additional share for profit in addition certain contracts in colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher

oman 

in oman occidental is the operator of block 9 with a 50percent working interest block 27 with a 65percent working interest block 53 with a 45percent working interest and block 62 with an 80percent working interest also in november 2017 occidental was awarded a threeyear exploration contract in block 30 

in december 2015 the existing psc for block 9 expired and occidental agreed to operate block 9 under modified operating terms until a new contract was approved the block 9 exploration and production sharing agreement 15year extension was signed in january 2017 and was ratified in march 2017 through royal decree in 2017 the average gross production from block 9 was 91000 boe per day 

the term for block 27 expires in 2035 and the average gross production was 16000 boe per day in 2017 

a 30year psc for block 53 mukhaizna field was signed with the government of oman in 2005 pursuant to which occidental assumed operation of the field by the end of 2017 occidental had drilled more than 3000 new wells and continued implementation of a major steamflood project in 2017 the average gross daily production was 123000 boe per day 

in 2008 occidental was awarded a 20year contract for block 62 subject to declaration of commerciality where it is pursuing development and exploration opportunities targeting natural gas and condensate resources in 2014 occidental signed a fiveyear extension for the initial phase for the discovered nonassociated gas area natural gas not in contact with crude oil in a reservoir for block 62 in 2017 the average gross daily production was 22000 boe per day 

occidentals oman operations reached a significant milestone in november 2017 with the production of its one billionth gross barrel of oil including condensate from all its blocks over twothirds of this production has come in the last ten years illustrating the tremendous growth achieved over that period in 2017 occidentals share of production in oman averaged 95000 boe per day 

 

qatar 

in qatar occidental is the operator of the offshore fields idd el shargi north dome isnd and idd el shargi south dome issd with a 100percent working interest in each the terms for isnd and issd expire in october 2019 and december 2022 respectively occidentals net share of production from isnd and issd was 53000 boe and 4000 boe per day respectively in 2017 

occidental operated alrayyan block 12 until the term expired on may 31 2017 when block 12 was successfully transitioned back to the government of qatar production from block 12 in 2017 was not significant 

occidental has continued to successfully implement large scale water flooding projects combined with stateoftheart horizontal drilling advanced completion techniques as well as utilizing extensive automated artificial lift systems that are significantly extending the life of the fields since the commencement of its operations in 1994 occidental has boosted the production from the idd el shargi fields by over 400 percent with current gross oil rates of around 91000 boe per day 

utilizing occidental’s expertise in artificial lift together with other gamechanging technologies and innovations the issd field continues to outperform expectations and exited 2017 with record gross production rates of over 9000 boe per day despite complex marine operations occidental is recognized as a regional leader in its safety performance as well as being the lowestcost offshore oil operator in the state of qatar 

occidental also partners in the dolphin energy project an investment that is comprised of two separate economic interests occidental has a 245percent interest in the upstream operations to develop and produce natural gas ngls and condensate from qatar’s north field through mid2032 occidental also has a 245percent interest in dolphin energy limited which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in midstream and marketing segment – pipeline transportation occidentals net share of production from the dolphin upstream operations was 42000 boe per day in 2017 

occidentals share of production from qatar was approximately 100000 boe per day in 2017 

united arab emirates 

in 2011 occidental acquired a 40percent participating interest in al hosn gas joining with the abu dhabi national oil company adnoc in a 30year joint venture agreement in 2017 al hosn gas gross production exceeded expectations producing over 525 mmcf per day of natural gas and 90000 barrels per day of ngls and condensate occidental’s share of production from al hosn gas was 211 mmcf per day of natural gas and 36000 barrels per day of ngls and condensate in 2017 al hosn gas includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in midstream and marketing segment  gas processing plants and co 2 fields and facilities 

occidental conducts a majority of its middle east business development activities through its office in abu dhabi which also provides various support functions for occidental’s middle east oil and gas operations 

  

latin america assets 

 colombia 

occidental has working interests in the la cirainfantas and teca areas and has operations within the llanos norte basin occidentals interests range from 39 to 61 percent and certain interests expire between 2023 and 2038 while others extend through the economic limit of the areas in 2017 occidental continued a thermal recovery pilot at the teca heavy oil field and the initial results are better than anticipated production began from these pilots in 2016 occidentals share of production from colombia was approximately 31000 boe per day in 2017  

proved reserves 

proved oil ngls and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements oil ngls and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity quality and transportation costs for the 2017  2016   and   2015  disclosures the calculated average west texas intermediate oil prices were 5134 4275 and 5028 per barrel respectively the calculated average brent oil prices for 2017  2016   and   2015  disclosures were 5493 4449 and 5557 per barrel respectively the calculated average henry hub gas prices for 2017  2016   and   2015  were 308 255 and 266 per mmbtu respectively 

occidental had proved reserves at yearend 2017  of 2598 million boe compared to the yearend 2016  amount of 2406 million boe proved reserves at yearend 2017  and 2016  consisted of respectively 58 percent and 56 percent oil 17 percent and 17 percent ngls and 25 percent and 27 percent natural gas proved developed reserves represented approximately 74 percent and 77 percent respectively of occidental’s total proved reserves at yearend 2017  and 2016  

occidental does not have any reserves from nontraditional sources for further information regarding occidentals proved reserves see supplemental oil and gas information following the financial statements 

 

changes in proved reserves 

occidentals total proved reserves increased 192 million boe in 2017  which included additions of 206 million boe from occidentals development program 

changes in reserves were as follows 



occidentals ability to add reserves other than through purchases depends on the success of improved recovery extension and discovery projects each of which depends on reservoir characteristics technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices as well as capital and operating costs many of these factors are outside management’s control and may negatively or positively affect occidentals reserves 

revisions of previous estimates 

revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic production decline or operating performance data in addition product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental for example lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves particularly for domestic properties because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations offsetting this effect lower prices increase occidentals share of proved reserves under pscs because more oil is required to recover costs conversely when prices rise occidentals share of proved reserves decreases for pscs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations in 2017 occidental had positive revisions of 151 million boe mainly in the permian basin and oman 

reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data 

improved recovery 

in 2017  occidental added proved reserves of 201 million boe mainly associated with the permian basin and uae these properties comprise both conventional projects which are characterized by the deployment of eor development methods largely employing application of co 2 flood waterflood or steam flood and unconventional projects these types of conventional eor development methods can be applied through existing wells though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells the use of either co 2  or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation the evaluation of engineering data availability and cost of 

  

either co 2  or steam and other economic factors both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells many of occidentals projects including unconventional projects rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells in addition some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells 

extensions and discoveries 

occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs in 2017  extensions and discoveries added 5 million boe related primarily to the recognition of proved developed reserves in oman 

purchases of proved reserves 

occidental continues to seek opportunities to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable as market conditions change the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly 

in 2017 occidental purchased 99 million boe of proved reserves in the permian basin which mainly came from acquisitions made in the third quarter of 2017 

sales of proved reserves 

in 2017 occidental sold 44 million boe in proved reserves mainly related to the sales of south texas and noncore permian acreage 

proved undeveloped reserves 

occidental had proved undeveloped reserves at yearend 2017 of 670 million boe compared to the yearend 2016 amount of 550 million boe 

changes in proved undeveloped reserves were as follows 



the increase in proved undeveloped reserves from the permian basin added approximately 168 million boe through improved recovery positive revisions and purchases the remaining additions mainly came from oman and uae 

the 2017 additions to proved undeveloped reserves were partially offset by 89 million boe of transfers to proved developed reserves mainly from the permian basin and sales of proved undeveloped reserves related to the sales of south texas and noncore permian acreage 

occidental’s highestreturn projects and most active development areas are located in the permian basin which 

 

represented 73 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 2017 the majority of occidental’s 2018 capital program of 39 billion is allocated to the development program in the permian basin overall occidental plans to spend approximately 8 billion or over 76 percent of total estimated future development costs over the next five years to develop its proved undeveloped reserves in the permian basin 

occidental’s proved undeveloped reserves in international locations are associated with approved longterm international development projects 

reserves evaluation and review process 

occidentals estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of december 31 2017  were made by occidental’s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management the estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by occidental to develop the reserves this process involves reservoir engineers geoscientists planning engineers and financial analysts as part of the proved reserves estimation process all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates operating costs and capital expenditures price differentials between benchmark prices the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods including estimates from decline curve analysis type curve analysis material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance these fieldtested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities 

net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor 

net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion proved undeveloped reserves are supported by a fiveyear detailed fieldlevel development plan which includes the timing location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled the development plan is reviewed and approved annually by senior management and technical personnel annually a detailed review is performed by occidental’s worldwide reserves group and its technical personnel on a leasebylease basis to assess whether proved undeveloped reserves are being converted on a timely basis within five years from the initial disclosure date any leases not showing timely transfers from proved 

  

undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves are reviewed by senior management to determine if the remaining reserves will be developed in a timely manner and has sufficient capital committed in the development plan only proved undeveloped reserves that are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan a portion of the proved developed reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved longterm development plans 

the current senior vice president reserves for oxy oil and gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates in compliance with us securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations including the internal audit and review of occidentals oil and gas reserves data he has over 30 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business and has held various assignments in north america asia and europe he is a threetime past chair of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee he is an american association of petroleum geologists aapg certified petroleum geologist and currently serves on the aapg committee on resource evaluation he is a member of the society of petroleum evaluation engineers the colorado school of mines potential gas committee and the unece expert group on resource classification he has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in geology from emory university in atlanta 

occidental has a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee consisting of senior corporate officers to review and approve occidentals oil and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidentals board of directors during the year since 2003 occidental has retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum engineering consultants to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes 

in 2017  ryder scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of december 31 2017  in accordance with the sec regulatory standards ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of occidental’s 2017  yearend total proved reserves portfolio in 2017  ryder scott reviewed approximately 20 percent of occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves since being engaged in 2003 ryder scott has reviewed the specific application of occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 80 percent of occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves management retains ryder scott to provide objective thirdparty input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by 

 

occidental occidental has filed ryder scotts independent report as an exhibit to this form 10k 

based on its reviews including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current sec regulations 

industry outlook 

the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions wti and brent oil price indexes for 2017 were above the 2016 index prices closing at 6042 per barrel and 6687 per barrel respectively as of december 31 2017  commodity prices remained relatively constant in 2017 and started to increase in the latter part of the fourth quarter 

oil prices will continue to be affected by i global supply and demand which are generally a function of global economic conditions inventory levels production disruptions technological advances regional market conditions and the actions of opec other significant producers and governments ii transportation capacity infrastructure constraints and costs in producing areas iii currency exchange rates and iv the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions 

ngls prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock in addition infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region 

domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas 

these and other factors make it difficult to predict the future direction of oil ngls and domestic gas prices reliably for purposes of the current capital plan occidental anticipates 2018 oil prices to be higher than average 2017 oil prices international gas prices are generally fixed under longterm contracts occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital 

chemical segment 

business environment 

in 2017 us economic growth surpassed that of 2016 and was supported by growing demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks even though natural gas and ethylene pricing was higher on average than in 2016 hurricane harvey impacted the ethylene market in the second half of 2017 and ethylene pricing on average ended the year slightly higher than 2016 the impact of higher energy and feedstock costs was offset in 2017 as tighter supply and increased demand in the caustic market 

  

resulted in higher margins while pvc margins slightly improved as prices kept up with raw material costs 

business review 

basic chemicals 

in 2017 the us economic growth rate was expected to exceed the 15 percent experienced in 2016 the higher us growth rate bolstered domestic demand as the 2017 industry chlorine operating rate increased by 4 percent to 88 percent resulting in an improvement in chlorine pricing in the second half of 2017 exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain were stable in 2017 as us ethylene and energy costs remained advantaged over global pricing liquid caustic soda prices improved both domestically and globally in 2017 as increased demand and tighter supply supported the higher pricing 

vinyls 

demand for pvc improved yearoveryear with domestic demand improving 5 percent and export demand being on par with 2016 domestic demand was driven by construction as housing starts continued their yearoveryear increase and rising home values drove increased home remodeling export volume remains a significant portion of pvc sales representing over 30 percent of total north american producer’s production pvc industry operating rates decreased less than one percent compared to 2016 despite impact from hurricane harvey industry pvc margins slightly improved in 2017 as pvc pricing kept pace with higher ethylene cost 

industry outlook 

i ndustry performance will depend on the health of the global economy specifically in the housing construction automotive and durable goods markets margins also depend on market supplyanddemand balances and feedstock and energy prices strengthening in the petroleum industry may positively affect the demand and pricing of a number of occidental’s products that are consumed by industry participants us commodity export markets will continue to be impacted by the relative strength of the us dollar which is anticipated to be relatively neutral in 2018 

basic chemicals 

continued improvement in the united states housing automotive and durable goods markets should drive a moderate increase in domestic demand for basic chemical products in 2018 export demand for caustic is also expected to remain firm in 2018 chloralkali operating rates should improve moderately with higher demand and continued competitive energy and raw material pricing as compared to global feedstock costs businesses such as calcium chloride and muriatic acid continue to improve as oil and gas drilling activity increases in the us which is expected to continue in 2018 

vinyls 

north american demand should continue to show improvement in 2018 over 2017 levels as growth in construction spending continues with further upside potential driven by new infrastructure projects north 

 

american operating rates are expected to remain relatively flat with 2017 but margins should improve as demand in the united states strengthens 

midstream and marketing segment 

business environment 

midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its various businesses including its gas processing transportation powergeneration assets and storage facilities and terminal business the marketing business aggregates markets and stores occidentals and thirdparty volumes marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs gas processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segments plants and pipelines as well as the margins obtained on related services 

the midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2017 were significantly higher than those in 2016 primarily due to improved permian to gulf coast price differentials higher plant income due to higher ngl prices and higher income from a full year of operating the ingleside crude terminal

pipeline and gathering systems and transportation 

margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped dolphin energy owns and operates a 230milelong 48inchdiameter natural gas pipeline dolphin pipeline which transports dry natural gas from qatar to the uae and oman the dolphin pipeline contributes significantly to occidentals pipeline transportation results through occidentals 245percent interest in dolphin energy the dolphin pipeline has capacity to transport up to 32 bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 22 bcf per day and up to 25 bcf per day in the summer 

occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2950 miles of pipelines from southeast new mexico across the permian basin in west texas to cushing oklahoma the system has a current throughput capacity of about 720000 barrels per day 71 million barrels of active storage capability and 128 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline in 2017 occidental expanded its oil pipeline system in new mexico by an additional 50 miles 

occidentals 2017 pipeline transportation earnings increased from 2016 due to higher throughput volumes and improved margins 

gas processing plants and co 2  fields and facilities 

occidental processes its and thirdparty domestic wet gas to extract ngls and other gas byproducts including co 2  and delivers dry gas to pipelines margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for ngls occidental’s 2017 earnings from these operations increased compared to 2016 due to higher throughput volumes and higher realized ngl pricing 

occidental has a 40percent participating interest in al hosn gas which is designed to process 10 bcf per day of 

  

natural gas and separate it into sales gas condensate ngls and sulfur the facilities produce approximately 10500 tons per day of sulfur of which approximately 4200 tons is occidentals share al hosn gas facilities generate revenues from gas processing fees and the sale of sulfur the increase in 2017 earnings compared to 2016 was primarily due to higher throughput volumes and higher sulfur pricing 

power generation facilities 

earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties the decrease in earnings in 2017 compared to 2016 was a result of lower production due to longer outages and lower ancillary sales 

storage facilities and terminal assets 

occidental owns the oxy ingleside energy center which includes the ingleside crude terminal a crude oil storage and export terminal located in the port of corpus christi in ingleside texas the facility has a competitive advantage over other similarly situated export terminals with a location near port entry access to deep water industryleading loading rates and reduced lay times while berthed the facility has over 300000 barrels per day of throughput capacity along with 21 million barrels of storage and three loading berths with 80000 barrels per hour loading capability the terminal is currently capable of loading articulated tug barges atb medium range mr aframax and suezmax size vessels 

in 2017 occidental became the largest exporter of permian light sweet crude from the united states us gulf coast the export market for crude has developed since the lifting of the export ban in 2016 while us producers have increased production of light crude us refineries are constrained in their ability to process incremental volumes of light crude without significant incremental capital investment necessitating exports to international markets in response to the increase in permian production and the need to export these barrels occidental is expanding its terminal to approximately 750000 barrels per day of capacity and 68 million barrels of storage which will be operational by the end of 2019 occidental is also expanding the facility to be capable of loading vlcc size vessels by the fourth quarter of 2018 

marketing 

the marketing group markets substantially all of occidental’s oil ngls and gas production as well as trades around its assets including its own and thirdparty transportation and storage capacity occidental’s thirdparty marketing activities focus on purchasing oil ngls and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets these purchases allow occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets marketing performance in 2017 improved compared to 2016 due to favorable permiantogulf coast crude oil price differentials and higher marketing volumes 

 

industry outlook 

the pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable marketing results can have significant volatile results depending on significant price swings as well as permiantogulf coast crude oil differentials the gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending on ngls prices generally higher ngls prices result in higher profitability 

segment results of operations and significant items affecting earnings 

segment earnings exclude income taxes interest income interest expense environmental remediation expenses unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments equity investments seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in occidentals consolidated quarterly earnings during the year 

the following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items 



 

  

oil and gas 



 

domestic oil and gas results were losses of 06 billion 16 billion and 42 billion in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively excluding significant items affecting results domestic oil and gas results in 2017 increased from 2016 due to a 22 percent increase in realized oil prices and lower dda rates 

 

excluding significant items affecting results domestic oil and gas results in 2016 were lower than 2015 due to a 13 percent decrease in realized oil prices higher dda rates and lower oil volumes due to the sale of noncore domestic operations these decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses 

international oil and gas earnings were 18 billion and 10 billion in 2017 and 2016 respectively and a loss of 37 billion in 2015 excluding significant items affecting results international oil and gas earnings in 2017 increased from 2016 the improved 2017 earnings reflected a 32 and 20 percent increase in realized crude oil and ngl prices in the middle east respectively 

excluding significant items affecting results the decrease in international oil and gas results in 2016 compared to 2015 reflected lower realized crude oil prices which had decreased by 23 percent in the middle east and 16 percent in latin america the decrease in prices was partially offset by lower dda rates 

average production costs for 2017 excluding taxes other than on income were 1173 per boe compared to 1076 per boe for 2016 the increase in average production costs per boe reflected the sales of low margin noncore gas assets including south texas and piceance basin permian resources production costs per boe for 2017 decreased by 5 percent from the prior year due to continued improved operational efficiencies 

average production costs for 2016 excluding taxes other than on income were 1076 per boecompared to 1157 per boe for 2015 the decrease in average costs reflected lower maintenance workover and support costs as a result of improvements in operating efficiencies especially in domestic operations 

the following table sets forth the production volumes of oil ngls and natural gas per day from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  





  

average daily production volumes were 602000 boe and 630000 boe for 2017 and 2016 respectively and included production from assets sold or exited of 8000 boe and 55000 boe for 2017 and 2016 respectively excluding production for assets sold or exited average daily production volumes were 594000 boe and 575000 boe for 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase in production mainly reflected higher permian resources production which increased by 14 percent from the prior year 

average daily production volumes were 630000 boe and 668000 boe for 2016 and 2015 respectively and included production from assets sold or exited of 55000 boe and 139000 boe for 2016 and 2015 respectively excluding production for assets sold or exited average daily production volumes were 575000 boe and 529000 boe for 2016 and 2015 respectively the increase in production from ongoing operations mainly reflected higher production from al hosn gas as it was not fully operational in 2015 and higher production from permian resources which increased its 2016 production by 13 percent compared to 2015 these increases were offset by lower production from south texas and other due to curtailed drilling 

chemical 



 

chemical segment earnings were 822 million 571 million and 542 million for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively excluding significant items affecting results the year over year increase in 2017 earnings compared to 2016 was the result of higher realized pricing for caustic soda improved vinyls margins higher sales volumes across most product lines and the addition of equity income from the joint venture ethylene cracker in ingleside texas 

excluding significant items affecting results the decrease in 2016 earnings compared to 2015 reflected lower pvc margins as pvc pricing decreased with lower ethylene pricing which was partially offset by lower ethylene and energy costs 

 

midstream and marketing 



 

midstream and marketing segment results were earnings of 01 billion and losses of 04 billion and 12 billion in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively excluding significant items affecting results the increase in 2017 results compared to 2016 reflected higher marketing margins due to improved spreads higher plant income due to higher ngl prices and higher income from a full year of operating the ingleside crude terminal 

excluding the significant items noted above the decrease in 2016 results compared to 2015 reflected lower marketing margins due to unfavorable contract pricing on longterm supply agreements as well as unfavorable permiantogulf coast differentials decreased throughput and lower realized ngls pricing 

corporate 

the following table sets forth significant transactions and events affecting occidental’s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature timing and amount 



 

  

taxes 

on december 22 2017 tax reform was enacted which made significant changes to the us federal income tax law including lowering the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent repealing the corporate amt and mandating a deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings and profits of usowned foreign corporations occidental recorded the effects of the changes in the tax law for which the accounting was complete in accordance with the guidance from the sec occidental recorded a provisional estimate for the federal and state tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation and the resulting impact to the net federal deferred tax liability tax reform resulted in a onetime noncash gain of 583 million due to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities to the new federal corporate income tax rate occidental recognized a noncurrent receivable of 221 million for its corporate amt credit carryforwards the tax impact of occidentals deemed repatriation of accumulated earnings was fully offset by foreign tax credits at december 31 2017 occidental reversed its indefinite reinvestment assertion with regards to its investments in foreign subsidiaries and as a result a deferred foreign tax liability of 99 million was recorded the ultimate impact of tax reform may differ from occidental’s estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions as well as additional regulatory guidance occidental will adjust provisional amounts as updated information is evaluated refer to note 10 in the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets of 18 billion were 581 million at december 31 2017  the deferred tax assets net of allowances are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences 

worldwide effective tax rate 

the following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations 



in 2017 occidentals worldwide effective tax rate was 1 percent which is lower than the 2016  rate mainly due to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities to the new federal corporate income tax rate excluding the impact of impairments tax rate changes and other nonrecurring 

 

items occidentals worldwide effective tax rate for 2017 would be 37 percent 

consolidated results of operations 

changes in components of occidentals results of continuing operations are discussed below 

revenue and other income items 



the increase in net sales in 2017  compared to 2016  was mainly due to the increase in average worldwide realized oil and ngls prices as well as higher realized prices for caustic soda in the chemical business average worldwide realized oil prices rose approximately 26 percent from 2016 to 2017 

the decrease in net sales in 2016  compared to 2015  was mainly due to the decline in average worldwide realized oil prices in 2016 and a decline in worldwide production as occidental exited noncore areas average worldwide realized oil prices fell by approximately 18 percent from 2015 to 2016 

price and volume changes in the oil and gas segment generally represent the majority of the change in oil and gas segment sales which is a substantially larger portion of the overall change in sales than the chemical and midstream and marketing segments 

the 2017 gain on sale included the sale of south texas and noncore proved and unproved permian acreage the 2016 gain on sale included the sale of piceance and south texas oil and gas properties the occidental tower building in dallas and a noncore specialty chemicals business the 2015 gain on sale included 98 million for the sale of an idled chemical facility 

expense items 



cost of sales increased in 2017 from 2016 due primarily to increases in chemical feedstock and energy costs and higher oil and gas purchase injectants cost of sales decreased in 2016 from the prior year due primarily to lower oil and gas maintenance costs and lower chemical feedstock and energy costs 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the change in timing of incentive compensation awards selling 

  

general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to lower compensation accruals in 2015 related to occidentals decision not to pay bonuses 

dda expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower volumes and lower dda rates dda expense decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to lower volumes from the exited noncore oil and gas operations and lower dda rates in the middle east 

in 2017 occidental incurred impairment and related items charges of 545 million of which 397 million related to proved and unproved noncore permian acreage and 120 million for idled midstream assets in 2016 occidental incurred impairment and related items charges of 825 million of which 541 million related to a reserve for doubtful accounts and 160 million for the termination of crude oil supply contracts 78 million related to the disposal of crc stock and 61 million related to exits from libya and iraq the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during 2016 includes a reserve against the longterm receivable related to environmental sites indemnified by maxus described in note 8 environmental liabilities and expenditures occidental recorded a reserve against this receivable due to the uncertainty of collection as a result of the maxus bankruptcy 

asset impairments and related items in 2015 of 102 billion included charges of 35 billion related to domestic oil and gas assets due to occidental’s exit from the williston and piceance basins as well as the decline in the futures price curve and management’s decision not to pursue activities associated with certain nonproducing acreage international oil and gas charges of 50 billion were due to a combination of occidental’s strategic plan to exit or reduce its exposure in certain middle east and north africa operations as well as the decline in the futures price curve which have made certain projects in the region unprofitable midstream charges of 13 billion included the impairment of occidental’s century gas processing plant as a result of our partner’s inability to provide volumes to the plant and meet their contractual obligations to deliver co 2  occidental recorded an otherthantemporary loss of 227 million for its available for sale investment in california resources 

taxes other than on income in 2017 increased from 2016 due primarily to higher oil ngl and natural gas prices which resulted in higher production taxes taxes other than on income decreased in 2016 from 2015 due primarily to lower production taxes which are directly tied to lower commodity prices 

other items 



in 2017 occidental recorded an income tax expense as opposed to an income tax benefit recorded in 2016 due to higher pretax operating income as a result of a recovery in commodity prices partially offset by the deferred tax benefit from tax reform the benefit from income taxes 

 

decreased in 2016 from the prior year as a result of a lower net loss in 2016 compared to 2015 which reflected significant impairments and related item charges 

the increase in income from equity investments in 2017 from 2016 is the result of the oxychem ingleside facility beginning operations in the first quarter of 2017 and a noncash fair value gain on the plains equity investment the decline in income from equity investments in 2016 from 2015 is the result of lower dolphin gas sales 

there were no charges for discontinued operations in 2017 discontinued operations net in 2016 and 2015 of 428 and 317 million respectively primarily include settlement payments by the republic of ecuador see note 2 of the consolidated financial statements 

consolidated analysis of financial position 

the changes in select components of occidental’s balance sheet are discussed below 



assets 

see liquidity and capital resources — cash flow analysis for discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 

the increase in trade receivables net was the result of improved oil and gas prices at the end of 2017 compared to the end of 2016 average december wti and brent prices increased approximately 11 percent and 17 percent per barrel respectively from 2016 to 2017 the increase in inventories in 2017 was the result of more exported domestic crude oil in transit in the midstream and marketing segment assets held for sale at the end of 2017 mainly reflected noncore proved and unproved permian acreage other current assets decreased as a result of the receipt of a federal tax refund related to the 2016 net operating loss 

  

carryback the increase in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to contributions to the ethylene cracker joint venture and the second quarter noncash fair value gain related to occidentals equity investment in plains pipeline the decrease in property plant and equipment net ppe was due to depletion and sales of noncore assets which was partially offset by capital additions and acquisitions 

liabilities and stockholders equity 

current maturities of longterm debt represent the 05 billion of 150percent senior notes due 2018 

the increase in accounts payable reflected higher marketing payables as a result of higher oil and gas prices at the end of 2017 compared to the end of 2016 

the decrease in deferred credits and other liabilitiesincome taxes was primarily due to the remeasurement of net deferred taxes as a result of a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate the decrease in longterm debt is the result of the reclassification of notes to current maturities of longterm debt the decrease in stockholders equity reflected the distribution of cash dividends partially offset by the 2017 net income 

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2017  occidental had approximately 17 billion  in cash and cash equivalents a substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the united states income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segments prices sales volumes and costs 

occidental utilized the remaining restricted cash balance resulting from the spinoff of california resources in the first quarter of 2016 to retire debt and pay dividends 

in november 2016 occidental issued 15 billion of senior notes comprised of 750 million of 30percent senior notes due 2027 and 750 million of 41percent senior notes due 2047 occidental received net proceeds of 149 billion interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually in arrears in february and august each year for each series of senior notes beginning august 15 2017 occidental used the proceeds for general corporate purposes 

in may and june 2016 respectively occidental utilized part of the proceeds from the april 2016 senior note offering described below to exercise the early redemption option on 125 billion of 175percent senior notes due in the first quarter of 2017 and to retire all 750 million of 4125percent senior notes that matured in june 2016 

in april 2016 occidental issued 275 billion of senior notes comprised of 04 billion of 26percent senior notes due 2022 115 billion of 34percent senior notes due 2026 and 12 billion of 44percent senior notes due 2046 occidental received net proceeds of approximately 272 billion interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually in arrears in april and october of each year for each series of senior notes beginning on october 15 2016 occidental used a portion of the proceeds to retire debt in may and june 2016 and used the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes 

 

in february 2016 occidental retired 700 million of 25percent senior notes that had matured 

in june 2015 occidental issued 15 billion of debt that was comprised of 750 million of 350percent senior unsecured notes due 2025 and 750 million of 4625percent senior unsecured notes due 2045 occidental received net proceeds of approximately 148 billion interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears in june and december of each year for both series of notes beginning on december 15 2015 

as of december 31 2017 occidental had an undrawn 20 billion revolving credit facility 2014 credit facility occidental did not draw down any amounts under the 2014 credit facility during 2017 or 2016 and no amounts were outstanding as of december 31 2017 

in january 2018 occidental entered into a new fiveyear 30 billion revolving credit facility 2018 credit facility which replaced the 2014 credit facility that was scheduled to expire in august 2019 the 2018 credit facility has similar terms to the 2014 credit facility and does not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict occidentals ability to borrow under the facility 

as of december 31 2017  under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on or acquisitions of occidental stock 

occidental expects to fund its liquidity needs including future dividend payments through cash on hand cash generated from operations monetization of noncore assets or investments and through future borrowings and if necessary proceeds from other forms of capital issuance 

cash flow analysis 



cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2017 increased 25 billion to 50 billion from 25 billion in 2016 operating cash flows were positively impacted by higher worldwide oil and ngls prices and higher domestic volumes in the oil and gas business and improved margins in the midstream and marketing and chemicals businesses cash flows from continuing operations in 2017 also included 761 million of federal tax refunds 

cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2016 decreased 07 billion to 25 billion from 33 billion in 2015 operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower worldwide average realized oil prices in the first half of 2016 which on a yearoveryear basis declined 18 percent the effect of lower commodity prices was partially offset by lower operating costs especially in the oil and gas segment where year over year production costs decreased by 7 percent cash flows from 

  

continuing operations in 2016 also included collections of 325 million of federal and state tax refunds operating cash flows from discontinued operations reflected the collection of the ecuador settlement 

other cost elements such as labor costs and overhead are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flows than changes in oil and gas product prices sales volumes and operating costs 

the chemical and midstream and marketing segments cash flows are significantly smaller and their overall cash flows are generally less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment 



occidental’s capital expenditures increased by 09 billion in 2017 to 36 billion the increase was a result of additional capital spending primarily in the permian basin due to a recovery in the commodity price environment 

occidental’s net capital expenditures declined by 27 billion in 2016 to 29 billion after contributions to the oxychem ingleside facility which is included in other investing activities the decline was a result of the oil and gas budget reduction due to lower commodity price environment and reductions in spending on longterm projects such as the oxychem ingleside facility which came on line in early 2017 

occidental remains committed to allocating capital to its highestreturn projects and its 2018 capital spending is expected to be 39 billion 

in 2017 cash flows provided by other investing activities of 04 billion includes proceeds of 14 billion which were primarily related to the sale of noncore permian acreage and occidentals south texas operations partially offset by 11 billion of acquisition costs primarily related to permian properties 

in 2016 cash flows used in other investing activities of 20 billion is comprised primarily of the acquisition of acreage in the permian in october 2016 

in 2015 cash flows used in other investing activities of 01 billion is comprised primarily of changes in the capital accrual and asset purchases offset by the sales of equity investments and assets 

 



  

cash used by financing activities in 2017 was 23 billion as compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2016 of 04 billion financing activities in 2017 mainly consist of dividend payments of 23 billion 

cash provided by financing activities in 2016 was 04 billion as compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2015 of 15 billion financing activities in 2016 included proceeds from long term debt of 42 billion and payments of long term debt of 27 billion occidental used restricted cash of 12 billion to pay dividends and retire debt 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of occidentals offbalancesheet arrangements 

guarantees 

occidental has guaranteed its portion of equity method investees debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds letters of credit indemnities and commitments provided by occidental to third parties mainly to provide assurance that opc or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees as of december 31 2017  occidental’s guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately 272 million of dolphin energys debt the fair value of the guarantees was immaterial 

occidental has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries for various letters of credit indemnities and commitments 

see oil and gas segment — business review — qatar and “segment results of operations” for further information about dolphin 

leases 

occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements mainly for transportation equipment power plants machinery terminals storage facilities land and office space occidental leases assets when leasing offers greater operating flexibility lease payments are generally expensed as part of cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses for more information see contractual obligations 

  

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes and crossreferences occidental’s contractual obligations this summary indicates on and offbalancesheet obligations as of december 31 2017  



 

delivery commitments 

occidental has commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil natural gas and ngls the domestic volumes contracted to be delivered which are not presented in note 7 of the consolidated financial statements are approximately 279 million barrels of oil through 2025 2 bcf of gas through 2019 and 25 million barrels of ngls through 2019 the price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall 

lawsuits claims and contingencies 

occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property damage or other losses punitive damages civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under cercla and similar federal state local and foreign environmental laws these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties and injunctive relief usually occidental or such subsidiaries are among 

 

many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies further some lawsuits claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction 

in accordance with applicable accounting guidance occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated in note 8 occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental remediation matters that satisfy this criteria reserve balances for matters other than environmental remediation matters that satisfy this criteria as of december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 were not material to occidentals consolidated balance sheet 

in 2017 andes petroleum ecuador ltd filed a demand for arbitration claiming it is entitled to a 40 percent share of the settlement payments made by the republic of ecuador to occidental for the 2006 expropriation of occidental’s participation contract for ecuador’s block 15 occidental intends to vigorously defend against this claim in arbitration 

the ultimate outcome and impact of outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings on occidental cannot be predicted management believes that the resolution of these matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on occidentals consolidated balance sheet statements of operations or cash flows after consideration of recorded accruals occidental’s estimates are based on information known about the legal matters and its experience in contesting litigating and settling similar matters occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available 

tax matters 

during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax jurisdictions although taxable years through 2009 for us federal income tax purposes have been audited by the united states internal revenue service irs pursuant to its compliance assurance program subsequent taxable years are currently under review taxable years from 2002 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions in certain of these jurisdictions tax authorities are in various stages of auditing occidental’s income taxes during the course of tax audits disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

indemnities to third parties 

occidental its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these indemnities usually are contingent upon 

  

the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2017 occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality 

the laws that require or address environmental remediation including cercla and similar federal state local and foreign laws may apply retroactively and regardless of fault the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites opc or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating closed and thirdparty sites remedial activities may include one or more of the following investigation involving sampling modeling risk assessment or monitoring cleanup measures including removal treatment or disposal or operation and maintenance of remedial systems the environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties injunctive relief and government oversight costs 

environmental remediation 

as of december 31 2017  occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 148 sites the following table presents occidental’s current and noncurrent environmental remediation reserves as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities 137 million in 2017 131 million in 2016 and 70 million in 2015 and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities — environmental remediation reserves 728 million in 2017 739 million in 2016 and 316 million in 2015 the reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the us environmental protection agency on the cercla national priorities list npl sites and three categories of nonnpl sites — thirdparty sites occidentaloperated sites and closed or nonoperated occidental sites 



as of december 31 2017  occidental’s environmental reserves exceeded 10 million each at 16 of the 148 sites 

 

described above and 89 of the sites had reserves from 0 to 1 million each 

as of december 31 2017 three sites — the diamond alkali superfund site and a former chemical plant in ohio both of which are indemnified by maxus energy corporation as discussed further below and a landfill in western new york  accounted for 95 percent of its reserves associated with npl sites the reserve balance above includes 17 npl sites indemnified by maxus 

five of the 70 thirdparty sites — a maxusindemnified chrome site in new jersey a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee an active plant outside of the united states a sediment site in louisiana and an active refinery in louisiana where occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities accounted for 60 percent of occidental’s reserves associated with these sites the reserve balance above includes 9 thirdparty sites indemnified by maxus 

three sites — chemical plants in kansas louisiana and texas accounted for 49 percent of the reserves associated with the occidentaloperated sites 

five other sites — a landfill in western new york former chemical plants in tennessee washington and california and a closed coal mine in pennsylvania accounted for 62 percent of the reserves associated with closed or nonoperated occidental sites 

environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation 

based on current estimates occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at all of its environmental sites could be up to 11 billion 

maxus environmental sites 

when occidental acquired diamond shamrock chemicals company dscc in 1986 maxus energy corporation maxus a subsidiary of ypf sa ypf agreed to indemnify occidental for a number of environmental sites including the diamond alkali superfund site site along a portion of the passaic river on june 17 2016 maxus and several affiliated companies filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal district court in the state of delaware prior to filing for bankruptcy maxus defended and indemnified occidental in connection with cleanup and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity including the site 

in march 2016 the epa issued a record of decision rod specifying remedial actions required for the lower 83 miles of the lower passaic river the rod does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river or newark bay during the third quarter of 2016 and following maxus’s bankruptcy filing occidental and the epa entered into an administrative order on consent aoc to complete the 

  

design of the proposed cleanup plan outlined in the rod at an estimated cost of 165 million the epa announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties 

occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and the remediation called for in the aoc and the rod as well as for certain other maxusindemnified sites occidentals accrued estimated environmental reserve does not consider any recoveries for indemnified costs occidental’s ultimate share of this liability may be higher or lower than the reserved amount and is subject to final design plans and the resolution of occidentals allocable share with other potentially responsible parties occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the aoc the rod and to perform remediation at other maxusindemnified sites in light of the maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties 

in june 2017 the court overseeing the maxus bankruptcy approved a plan of liquidation plan to liquidate maxus and create a trust to pursue claims against ypf repsol and others to satisfy claims by occidental and other creditors for past and future cleanup and other costs in july 2017 the courtapproved plan became final and the trust became effective among other responsibilities the trust will pursue claims against ypf repsol and others and distribute assets to maxus creditors in accordance with the trust agreement and plan 

environmental costs 

occidental’s environmental costs some of which include estimates are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended december 31 



operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures relate to longerlived improvements in properties currently operated by occidental remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations 

occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately 137 million for 2018  

foreign investments 

many of occidental’s assets are located outside north america at december 31 2017  the carrying value of occidental’s assets in countries outside north america 

 

aggregated approximately 98 billion or 23 percent of occidental’s total assets at that date of such assets approximately 82 billion are located in the middle east and approximately 11 billion are located in latin america for the year ended december 31 2017  net sales outside north america totaled 44 billion or approximately 35 percent of total net sales 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires occidentals management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts there has been no material change to occidentals critical accounting policies over the past three years the selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve managements judgment 

oil and gas properties 

the carrying value of occidental’s ppe represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest net of accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization dda and any impairment charges for assets acquired ppe cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets 

occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found if proved reserves have been found the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized otherwise occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense in some cases a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12month period after drilling is complete 

occidental expenses annual lease rentals the costs of injectants used in production and geological geophysical and seismic costs as incurred 

occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unitofproduction method it amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering 

  

data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 

several factors could change occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves for example occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices in other cases particularly with longlived properties lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical for such properties higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded 

additionally occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable if there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices significant changes in reserve estimates changes in managements plans or other significant events management will evaluate the property for impairment under the successful efforts method if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants the impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time these assumptions include estimates of future product prices contractual prices estimates of riskadjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs it is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in additional impairments 

 

for impairment testing unless prices were contractually fixed occidental used observable forward strip prices for oil and natural gas prices when projecting future cash flows prices are held constant for periods beyond those covered by forward strip prices future operating and development costs were estimated using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce oil and gas reserves market prices for crude oil natural gas and ngls have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future current market fundamentals indicate improved prices for crude oil natural gas and ngls in 2018 however changes in global supply and demand transportation capacity currency exchange rates and applicable laws and regulations and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions could impact current forecasts future fluctuations in commodity prices could result in estimates of future cash flows to vary significantly 

the most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in occidentals oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the dda rate for example a 5 percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the dda rate by approximately 055 per barrel which would increase or decrease pretax income by approximately 120 million annually at current production rates 

a portion of the carrying value of occidental’s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were 10 billion and 14 billion at december 31 2017  and 2016 respectively the unproved amounts are not subject to dda until they are classified as proved properties capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to dda when proved reserves are assigned to the property if the exploration efforts are unsuccessful or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices higher development and operating costs contractual conditions or other factors the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed the timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties if warranted depends upon managements plans the nature timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance 

chemical assets 

occidentals chemical assets are depreciated using either the unitofproduction or the straightline method based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets which range from three years to 50 years are also used for impairment tests the estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance as well as planned major maintenance activities pmma ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred 

  

pmma costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul additionally occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use these capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service the resulting revision if any of the asset’s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively 

without these continued expenditures the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition demand feedstock costs energy prices environmental regulations and technological changes 

occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

occidentals net ppe for the chemical segment is approximately 24 billion and its dda expense for 2018 is expected to be approximately 350 million the most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical plants would be on depreciation expense for example a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pretax earnings by approximately 44 million per year 

midstream marketing and other assets 

derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cashflow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment otherwise any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period for cashflow hedges the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income oci with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged realized gains or losses from cashflow hedges and any ineffective portion are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location quality grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of operations there were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 

a hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if at inception and 

 

throughout its life it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows respectively of the hedging instrument in the case of hedging a forecast transaction the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable 

occidentals midstream and marketing ppe is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using either the unitofproduction or straightline method occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

fair value measurements 

occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a threelevel fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation techniques level 1 – using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities level 2 – using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities and level 3 – using unobservable inputs transfers between levels if any are recognized at the end of each reporting period 

fair values  recurring 

occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs occidental utilizes the midpoint between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value in addition to using market data occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique for assets and liabilities carried at fair value occidental measures fair value using the following methods 

 Ø overthecounter otc bilateral financial commodity contracts foreign exchange contracts options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industrystandard models that consider various inputs including quoted forward prices for commodities time value volatility factors credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments as well as other relevant economic measures substantially all of these inputs 

  

are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 

 

occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a marketobservable price for an identical or similar asset or liability this approach utilizes managements judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows and discounts those cash flows using a riskadjusted discount rate 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience remedial objectives available technologies applicable laws and regulations and costsharing arrangements occidental bases environmental reserves on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred using the most costeffective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established the reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established presently none of the environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received or when receipt of recovery is highly probable 

many factors could affect occidental’s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses the most significant are 1 cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate 2 the length of time type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination 3 a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify occidental’s proposed remedial plan 4 improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs 5 laws and regulations may 

 

change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability and 6 changes in allocation or costsharing arrangements may occur 

certain sites involve multiple parties with various costsharing arrangements which fall into the following three categories 1 environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties 2 oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest or 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of properties in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs in these circumstances occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate when estimating occidentals ultimate share of liability occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and based on these factors believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved 

in addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures which often take in excess of 10 years at npl sites occidentals reserves include managements estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly 

if occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings for example if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent occidental would record a pretax gain of 87 million if the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 87 million 

other loss contingencies 

occidental is involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings and audits occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis 

loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate management’s judgments could change based on new information changes in or interpretations of laws or regulations changes in management’s plans or intentions opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings or other factors see lawsuits claims and contingencies for additional information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

commodity price risk 

general 

occidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil ngls and natural gas prices price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect occidental’s pretax annual income by approximately 110 million for a 1 per barrel change in oil prices and 30 million for a 1 per barrel change in ngls prices if domestic natural gas prices varied by 050 per mcf it would have an estimated annual effect on occidentals pretax income of approximately 20 million these pricechange sensitivities include the impact of psc and similar contract volume changes on income if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidental’s results to prices also will change marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil natural gas and to a lesser degree other commodities these sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing volumes and cannot be predicted reliably 

occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices a variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of 10 per ton would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 10 million and 30 million respectively a variation in pvc prices of 001  per lb would 

 

have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 30 million historically over time product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins according to ihs chemical or townsend 2017  average contract prices were chlorine324 per ton caustic soda635 per ton and pvc040 per lb 

occidental uses derivative instruments including a combination of shortterm futures forwards options and swaps to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas 

  

risk management 

occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies the controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check members of the risk management group report to the corporate vice president and treasurer controls for these activities include limits on value at risk limits on credit limits on total notional trade value segregation of duties delegation of authority daily price verifications reporting to senior management of various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls 

  

fair value of marketing derivative contracts 

occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value fair values for these contracts are derived from level 1 and level 2 sources the fair values in future maturity periods are insignificant 

the following table shows the fair value of occidentals derivatives excluding collateral segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation 



  

cashflow hedges 

occidental’s marketing operations from time to time store natural gas purchased from third parties at occidental’s north american leased storage facilities as of december 31 2017 and 2016 occidental had approximately 7 billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas held in storage and had cashflow hedges for the forecasted sales to be settled by physical delivery of approximately 7 bcf of stored natural gas 

  

quantitative information 

occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities this measure determines the maximum potential negative one day change in fair value 

  

with a 95 percent level of confidence additionally occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice as a result of these controls occidental has determined that market risk of its trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance 

  

interest rate risk 

general 

occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variablerate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2017  variablerate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of occidentals total debt 

  

foreign currency risk 

occidental’s foreign operations have limited currency risk occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes a vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in united states dollars additionally all of occidental’s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the united states dollar as the functional currency as of december 31 2017  the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the marketing operations was immaterial the effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income 

 

tabular presentation of interest rate risk 

the table below provides information about occidentals debt obligations debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date 



 

credit risk 

the majority of occidentals counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants as appropriate occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis 

certain of occidentals otc derivative instruments contain creditriskcontingent features primarily tied to credit ratings for occidental or its counterparties which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post occidental believes that if it had received a onenotch reduction in its credit ratings it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateralposting requirements as of december 31 2017  and 2016  

as of december 31 2017  the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties occidental believes its exposure to creditrelated losses at december 31 2017  was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented

managements annual assessment of and report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of occidental petroleum corporation and its subsidiaries occidental is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting occidental’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles occidental’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of occidental’s assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that occidental’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of occidental’s management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of occidental’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management has assessed the effectiveness of occidental’s internal control system as of december 31 2017  based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework issued in 2013 by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management believes that as of december 31 2017  occidental’s system of internal control over financial reporting is effective 

occidental’s independent auditors kpmg llp have issued an audit report on occidental’s internal control over financial reporting 

disclosure controls and procedures 

occidentals president and chief executive officer and its senior vice president and chief financial officer supervised and participated in occidentals evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation occidentals president and chief executive officer and senior vice president and chief financial officer concluded that occidentals disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2017  

there has been no change in occidentals internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act during the fourth quarter of 2017  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect occidentals internal control over financial reporting the report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting is set forth in item 8

 item 1a risk factors 

volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidentals financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products particularly oil and to a lesser extent natural gas and ngls and its chemical products 

prices for crude oil natural gas and ngls fluctuate widely historically the markets for crude oil natural gas ngls and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future prolonged or further declines in crude oil natural gas and ngls prices would continue to reduce occidentals operating results and cash flows and could impact its future rate of growth and further impact the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets 

prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in occidentals control these factors include among others 



 

 

the longterm effects of these and other conditions on the prices of crude oil natural gas ngls and refined products are uncertain generally occidentals practice is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities however management may elect to hedge the price risk of crude oil natural gas ngls and refined products in the future 

global economic and political conditions have driven oil and gas prices down significantly since 2014 these conditions may continue for an extended period declines in commodity prices could require occidental to reduce capital spending and impair the carrying value of assets 

the prices obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the united states and global economies as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

occidental may experience delays cost overruns losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities 

occidental bears the risks of equipment failures construction delays escalating costs or competition for services materials supplies or labor property or border disputes disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns 

exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses 

  

governmental actions and political instability may affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s businesses are subject to the decisions of many federal state local and foreign governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 

 in addition occidental has and may continue to experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability nationalizations corruption armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources 

occidentals oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves 

results of operations reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend in part on occidental’s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves occidental has many competitors including national oil companies some of which i are larger and better funded ii may be willing to accept greater risks or iii have special competencies competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts in addition during periods of low product prices any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts 

occidental’s acquisition activities also carry risks that it may i not fully realize anticipated benefits due to lessthanexpected reserves or production or changed circumstances such as the deterioration of natural gas prices in recent years and the more recent significant decline in crude oil prices ii bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties iii experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity or iv assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated 

 

occidental’s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability including production decline rates operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices future operating costs and capital expenditures as well as assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies the procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants however there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves actual production revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates and the variance may be material if occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected in addition the discounted cash flows included in this form 10k should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted 12month average firstdayofthemonth prices in accordance with sec regulations actual future prices and costs may differ materially from sec regulationcompliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves 

concerns about climate change and further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may adversely affect occidental’s operations or results 

continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional and local legislation and regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these and other government actions relating to greenhouse gas emissions could require occidental to incur increased operating and maintenance costs such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for oil natural gas and other products that occidental’s businesses produce any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming and thereby reduce demand for oil natural gas and other products produced by occidental’s businesses consequently government actions designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on occidental’s business financial condition and results of operations 

it is difficult to predict the timing and certainty of such government actions and the ultimate effect on occidental which could depend on among other things the type and extent of greenhouse gas reductions required the availability and price of emissions allowances or credits the availability and price of alternative fuel sources the energy sectors covered and occidental’s ability to recover the costs incurred through its operating agreements or the pricing of the company’s oil natural gas and other products 

  

occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic events 

the occurrence of events such as hurricanes floods droughts earthquakes or other acts of nature well blowouts fires explosions chemical releases crude oil releases material or mechanical failure industrial accidents physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses 

cyberattacks could significantly affect occidental 

cyberattacks on businesses have escalated in recent years occidental relies on digital systems related infrastructure technologies and networks to run its business and to control and manage its oil and gas chemicals marketing and pipeline operations use of the internet cloud services and other public networks exposes occidental’s business to cyberattacks that attempt to gain unauthorized access to data and systems release confidential information corrupt data and disrupt critical systems and operations even though occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of a cyberattack there can be no assurance that such cyber security measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring while we have experienced cyberattacks in the past we have not suffered any material losses however if in the future our cyber security measures are compromised or prove insufficient the potential consequences to occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant as cyberattacks continue to evolve in magnitude and sophistication we may be required to expend additional resources in order to continue to enhance our cyber security measures and to investigate and remediate any digital systems related infrastructure technologies and network security vulnerabilities 

occidentals oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business 

 unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities acquire properties containing proved reserves or both proved reserves will generally decline management expects improved recovery extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors such as geology government regulations and permits and the effectiveness of development plans are partially or fully outside managements control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations

strategy 

general 

through its operations occidental aims to maximize total shareholder return through a combination of 

 in conducting its business occidental accepts commodity engineering and limited exploration risks capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks 

price volatility is inherent in the oil and gas business in 2016 occidental continued to experience a challenging price environment with low oil natural gas and ngls prices in order to manage this risk occidental strives to retain sufficient cash on hand and may access capital markets as necessary 

in connection with occidentals strategic review initiatives occidental 

 

the following describes the application of occidental’s overall strategy for each of its operating segments 

oil and gas 

the oil and gas business implements occidentals strategy primarily by 



 

discipline with an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing occidentals existing positions 

in 2016 oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately 20 billion and were mainly comprised of expenditures in the permian basin and the middle east this activity reflects occidentals strategy to focus on achieving returns above the cost of capital even in a low price environment 

management believes occidentals oil and gas segment growth will occur primarily through exploitation and development opportunities in the permian basin and colombia and focused international projects in the middle east 

chemical 

the primary objective of oxychem is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve abovecostofcapital returns the chemical segments strategy is to be a lowcost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine which is coproduced with caustic soda and markets both to external customers in addition chlorine together with ethylene is converted through a series of intermediate products into polyvinyl chloride pvc oxychems focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chloralkali and pvc businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities in early 2014 oxychem through a 5050 joint venture with mexichem sab de cv broke ground on a 12 billion poundperyear ethylene cracker at the oxychem ingleside facility the joint venture provides an opportunity to capitalize on the advantage that us shale gas development has presented to us chemical producers by providing lowcost ethane as a raw material the joint venture will provide oxychem with an ongoing source of ethylene significantly reducing oxychems reliance on thirdparty ethylene suppliers the construction of the ethylene cracker remains on budget and on schedule and is expected to begin operating in early 2017 in 2016 capital expenditures for oxychem totaled 324 million additionally 160 million was spent on the mexichem joint venture in the first quarter of 2016 oxychem sold its occidental tower building in dallas for a pretax gain of approximately 57 million and a noncore specialty chemicals business for a pretax gain of approximately 31 million in 2016 oxychem announced a 145 million expansion of its manufacturing plant in geismar louisiana the project will produce an oxychem patented new raw material used in making nextgeneration climatefriendly refrigerants with a low global warming and ozone depletion potential construction work has begun with an anticipated completion date in late 2017 

  

midstream and marketing 

the midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing use of its assets including its transportation and storage capacity and by providing access to multiple markets in order to generate returns the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to other occidental segments as well as third parties the segment invests in and operates pipeline systems gas plants cogeneration facilities and storage facilities the segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas power and other commodities used in occidentals businesses while limiting credit risk exposure capital is employed to sustain or where appropriate increase operational and transportation capacity and to improve the competitiveness of occidentals assets in 2016 capital expenditures totaled 358 million related to permian basin gas processing and gathering infrastructure al hosn gas and the ingleside crude terminal 

key performance indicators 

occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return in addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics 



oil and gas segment 

business environment 

oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s financial performance the following table presents the average daily west texas intermediate wti brent and new york mercantile exchange nymex prices for 2016  and 2015  



 

the following table presents occidentals average realized prices as a percentage of wti brent and nymex for 2016  and 2015  



average wti and brent oil price indexes declined 11 percent and 16 percent from 4880 and 5364 in 2015  to 4332 and 4504 in 2016  respectively average worldwide realized oil prices fell 837 or 18 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 however the wti and brent oil price indexes increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2016  closing at 5372 per barrel and 5682 per barrel respectively as of december 31 2016  well above the 2016 average prices the average realized domestic natural gas price in 2016  decreased 12 percent from 2015  average nymex natural gas prices declined 12 percent from 275 in 2015  to 242 in 2016  

prices and differentials can vary significantly even on a shortterm basis making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty 

the decline in oil and gas prices during 2016 and 2015 as well as the decision to sell or exit noncore assets caused occidental to assess the carrying value of all of its oil and gas producing assets and assess development plans for its nonproducing assets in 2016 impairment and related charges were immaterial in 2015 occidental recorded total pretax impairment and related charges of 35 billion for its domestic assets and 50 billion for its international assets to assess carrying value of its oil and gas assets occidental uses oil and gas price curves settled on the last trading day of each quarter while oil and gas future prices were increasing at the end of 2016 any future sustained declines in commodity prices may result in additional impairments in the future 

operations 

2016 developments 

in march 2016 occidental completed the sale of its piceance basin operations in colorado for approximately 153 million resulting in a pretax gain of 121 million 

in september 2016 occidental completed the sale of its south texas eagle ford nonoperated properties for 63 million resulting in a pretax gain of 59 million 

in october 2016 occidental acquired producing and nonproducing leasehold acreage in the permian basin this acquisition includes 35000 net acres in reeves and pecos counties texas in the southern delaware basin in areas where occidental currently operates or has working interests separately occidental also acquired working interests in several producing oil and gas properties with co 2  floods and related eor infrastructure increasing occidentals ownership in several properties where it is currently the operator or an existing working interest partner the total purchase price for these 

  

transactions was approximately 20 billion 

in 2016 occidental completed its exit of noncore operations in bahrain iraq libya and yemen 

business review 

domestic interests 

occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns occidentals domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years which is extended through the end of production once it commences of the total 36 million net acres in which occidental has interests approximately 84 percent is leased 15 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights

permian basin 

occidentals permian basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas the basin extends throughout west texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states accounting for approximately 16 percent of the total united states oil production occidental is the largest operator and the largest producer of oil in the permian basin with an approximate 12 percent net share of the total oil production in the basin occidental also produces and processes natural gas and ngls in the basin 

occidental manages its permian basin operations through two business units permian resources which includes growthoriented unconventional opportunities and permian eor which utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques such as co 2 floods and waterfloods during 2016  the permian operations focused on full cycle value through capital efficiency reduced operating expense improved base production and new well productivity in the permian basin occidental spent over 12 billion of capital in 2016  with 60 percent spent on permian resources assets in 2017  occidental expects to allocate approximately one third of the 2017 capital budget to permian resources for focused development areas in the midland and delaware basins and approximately 10 to 15 percent to permian eor in order to add to existing facilities to increase co 2 production and injection capacity for future projects 

occidentals permian resources operations are among its fastest growing assets with over 11650 drilling locations in its horizontal inventory located in the midland and delaware subbasins this inventory was developed using data gathered from appraisal efforts and development drilling along with offset operators drilling activities as of year end approximately 650 of these drilling locations represented proved reserves continued wellbore placement and completion optimization through advanced subsurface characterization and the application of enhanced manufacturing principles combined with projected commercial savings are expected to increase the well inventory even further the development program which largely began in 2010 continued in 2016  in 2016 permian resources drilled 63 horizontal wells production from permian resources comes from approximately 5550 net wells of which 23 percent are operated by other operators these investments in permian wells operated by others allows occidental to access and leverage additional data in the same areas where it is operating by analyzing the operated by others data with the significant amount of data occidental has gathered its permian operations are able to use the information to aid in reducing operating expenses gain drilling and completions efficiencies increase the productivity of its wells and improve the base production in 2016 permian resources added 92 million boe to occidentals proved reserves 

permian eor operates a combination of co 2  floods and waterfloods which have similar development characteristics and ongoing monitoring and maintenance requirements due to a unique combination of characteristics the permian basin has been a leader in the 

  

implementation of co 2  enhanced oil recovery projects the permian basin’s concentration of large conventional reservoirs favorable co 2  flooding performance and the proximity to naturally occurring co 2  supply has resulted in decades of steady growth in enhanced oil production with 31 active floods and over 40 years of experience permian eor is the industry leader in permian basin co 2  flooding 

occidental is an industry leader in applying this technology which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10 to 25 percent in the fields where it is employed significant opportunity remains to expand occidentals existing projects into new portions of reservoirs that thus far have only been waterflooded leaving opportunity for significant additional recovery with new co 2  injection even small improvements in recovery efficiency can add significant reserves technology improvements such as the recent trend towards vertical expansion of the co 2  flooded interval into residual oil zone targets continue to yield more recovery from existing projects over the last few years occidental has had an ongoing program of deepening wells with 125 wells deepened in 2016  and 100 wells planned for 2017  occidental utilizes workover rigs to drill the extra depth into additional co 2  floodable sections of the reservoir these are low cost projects that can add reserves even in a low price environment permian eor has a large inventory of future co 2  projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated depending on market conditions in 2016 permian eor had its largest improved recovery additions in more than 10 years adding 72 million boe to occidentals proved reserves primarily as a result of executing co 2  flood development projects and expansions as well as extending the approved co 2 slug size of current floods 

the current strategy for permian eor is to invest sufficient capital to maintain current production and provide cash flow by exploiting natural synergies between permian eor and permian resources occidental is able to deliver unique advantages efficiencies and expertise across its permian basin operations occidentals share of production in the permian basin was approximately 269000 boe per day in 2016 with 124000 boe per day coming from permian resources and 145000 boe per day from permian eor 

south texas and other 

occidental holds approximately 178000 net acres in south texas occidentals share of production in south texas and other was approximately 33000 boe per day 

international interests 

productionsharing contracts 

occidentals interests in oman and qatar are subject to production sharing contracts psc under such contracts occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain production costs and an additional share for profit in addition certain contracts in colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases 

 

when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher

occidental also holds working interests in the tarija chuquisaca and santa cruz regions of bolivia which produce gas occidentals share of production from bolivia was 1000 boe per day in 2016  

proved reserves 

proved oil ngls and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements oil ngls and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity quality and transportation costs for the 2016  2015   and   2014  disclosures the calculated average west texas intermediate oil prices 

  

were 4275 5028 and 9499 per barrel respectively the calculated average brent oil prices for 2016  2015   and   2014  disclosures were 4449 5557 and 9951 per barrel respectively the calculated average henry hub gas prices for 2016  2015   and   2014  were 255 266 and 442 per mmbtu respectively 

occidental had proved reserves at yearend 2016  of 2406 million boe compared to the yearend 2015  amount of 2200 million boe proved reserves at yearend 2016  and 2015  consisted of respectively 56 percent and 59 percent oil 17 percent and 15 percent ngls and 27 percent and 26 percent natural gas proved developed reserves represented approximately 77 percent and 79 percent respectively of occidental’s total proved reserves at yearend 2016  and 2015  

occidental does not have any reserves from nontraditional sources for further information regarding occidentals proved reserves see supplemental oil and gas information following the financial statements 

changes in proved reserves 

occidentals total proved reserves increased 206 million boe in 2016  which included additions of 187 million boe from occidentals development program 

changes in reserves were as follows 



occidentals ability to add reserves other than through purchases depends on the success of improved recovery extension and discovery projects each of which depends on reservoir characteristics technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices as well as capital and operating costs many of these factors are outside management’s control and may negatively or positively affect occidentals reserves 

revisions of previous estimates 

revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic production decline or operating performance data in addition product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental for example lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves particularly for domestic properties because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations offsetting this effect lower prices increase occidentals share of proved reserves under pscs because more oil is required to recover costs conversely when prices rise occidentals share of proved reserves decreases for pscs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations in 2016 positive revisions of 159 million boe were primarily due to technical revisions in al hosn gas and price 

 

revisions in oman due to the psc impact partially offset by negative domestic price revisions 

reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data 

improved recovery 

in 2016  occidental added proved reserves of 185 million boe mainly associated with the permian basin and oman operations these properties comprise both conventional projects which are characterized by the deployment of eor development methods largely employing application of co 2 flood waterflood or steam flood and unconventional projects these types of conventional eor development methods can be applied through existing wells though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells the use of either co 2  or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation the evaluation of engineering data availability and cost of either co 2  or steam and other economic factors both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells many of occidentals projects including unconventional projects rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells in addition some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells 

extensions and discoveries 

occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs in 2016  extensions and discoveries added 2 million boe related primarily to the recognition of proved developed reserves in oman 

purchases of proved reserves 

occidental continues to seek opportunities to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable as market conditions change the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly 

in 2016 occidental purchased 137 million boe of proved reserves in the permian basin which mainly came from acquisitions made in october 2016 

sales of proved reserves 

in 2016 occidental sold 46 million boe in proved reserves mainly related to libya and piceance 

proved undeveloped reserves 

in 2016  occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 195 million boe mainly from permian basin improved recovery and purchases these proved undeveloped reserve additions were partially offset by transfers of 66 million boe to the proved developed category as a result of the 2016  development programs 

  

and 47 million boe of negative price and price related revisions permian basin and oman accounted for approximately 89 percent of the reserve transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2016  occidental incurred approximately 05 billion in 2016  to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves a substantial portion of the proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 2016  was the result of the development program in the permian basin which represents 75 percent of total yearend proved undeveloped reserves 

reserves evaluation and review process 

occidentals estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of december 31 2016  were made by occidental’s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management the estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by occidental to develop the reserves this process involves reservoir engineers geoscientists planning engineers and financial analysts as part of the proved reserves estimation process all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates operating costs and capital expenditures price differentials between benchmark prices the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods including estimates from decline curve analysis typecurve analysis material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance these fieldtested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities 

net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 

the current senior vice president reserves for oxy oil and gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates in compliance with us securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations including the internal audit and review of occidentals oil and gas reserves data the senior vice president has over 30 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business and has held various assignments in north america asia and europe he is a threetime past chair of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee he is an american association of petroleum geologists aapg certified 

 

petroleum geologist and currently serves on the aapg committee on resource evaluation he is a member of the society of petroleum evaluation engineers the colorado school of mines potential gas committee and the unece expert group on resource classification the senior vice president has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in geology from emory university in atlanta 

occidental has a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee consisting of senior corporate officers to review and approve occidentals oil and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidentals board of directors during the year since 2003 occidental has retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum engineering consultants to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes 

in 2016  ryder scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of december 31 2016  in accordance with the sec regulatory standards ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of occidental’s 2016  yearend total proved reserves portfolio in 2016  ryder scott reviewed approximately 18 percent of occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves since being engaged in 2003 ryder scott has reviewed the specific application of occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 80 percent of occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves management retains ryder scott to provide objective thirdparty input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by occidental occidental has filed ryder scotts independent report as an exhibit to this form 10k 

based on its reviews including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current sec regulations 

industry outlook 

the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions average annual wti and brent oil price indexes for 2016 were below the 2015 averages but ended the year higher closing at 5372 per barrel and 5682 per barrel respectively as of december 31 2016  commodity prices remained relatively constant in early 2017 

oil prices will continue to be affected by i global supply and demand which are generally a function of global economic conditions inventory levels production disruptions technological advances regional market 

  

conditions and the actions of opec other significant producers and governments ii transportation capacity infrastructure constraints and cost in producing areas iii currency exchange rates and iv the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions 

ngls prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock in addition infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region 

domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas 

these and other factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil ngls and domestic gas prices reliably international gas prices are generally fixed under longterm contracts occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital 

chemical segment 

business environment 

although united states economic growth in 2016 lagged behind that of 2015 demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks remained fairly constant as natural gas and ethylene pricing was lower on average than in 2015 historically high planned and unplanned ethylene outages resulting in price volatility within the spot market and rising energy costs in the last half of 2016 put pressure on chemical margins the impact of energy and feedstock costs was partially offset by the end of 2016 as tighter supply in the caustic soda and pvc markets resulted in improved margins 

business review 

basic chemicals 

in 2016 the united states economic growth rate was expected to be below the 26 percent experienced in 2015 the lower than expected us growth rate tempered domestic demand as the 2016 industry chlorine operating rate increased by only 1 percent to 84 percent resulting in only a moderate improvement in chlorine pricing exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain were relatively strong in 2016 as united states ethylene and energy costs were advantaged over global pricing liquid caustic soda prices improved both domestically and globally in the last three quarters of 2016 as new capacity growth in the united states slowed 

vinyls 

demand for domestic and export pvc improved year overyear 41 percent and 42 percent respectively domestic demand was driven by construction as housing starts continued their yearoveryear increase and rising home values drove increased home remodeling export volume remains a significant portion of pvc sales representing over 30 percent of total north american 

 

producer’s production pvc industry operating rates in 2016 were approximately 23 percent higher than 2015 industry pvc margins declined slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 as pvc pricing decreased with lower ethylene pricing 

industry outlook 

industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy specifically in the housing construction automotive and durable goods markets margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices longterm weakness in the petroleum industry may negatively affect the demand and pricing of a number of occidental’s products that are consumed by industry participants further strengthening of the us dollar may cause headwinds in the us commodity export market 

basic chemicals 

continued improvement in the united states housing automotive and durable goods markets should drive a moderate increase in domestic demand for basic chemical products in 2017 export demand for caustic is also expected to remain firm in 2017 overall the low chloralkali operating rates driven by capacity increases over the last few years should improve as the pace of expansions have slowed considerably both domestically and globally improved 2016 margins from historically low values in 2015 are expected to continue as long as united states feedstock costs primarily natural gas and ethylene remain favorable compared to global feedstock costs businesses such as calcium chloride and muriatic acid continue to be challenged but are expected to improve as oil prices rise 

vinyls 

north american demand should improve slightly in 2017 over 2016 levels as growth in construction spending continues with further upside potential driven by new infrastructure projects north american operating rates are expected to remain relatively flat with 2016 but margins should improve as demand in the united states strengthens 

midstream and marketing segment 

business environment 

midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing business and its processing transportation and power generation assets the marketing business aggregates and markets occidentals and thirdparty volumes and engages in storage activities marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segments plants and pipelines as well as the margins obtained on related services 

the midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2016 were significantly higher than those in 2015 primarily due to impairments taken in 2015 excluding the 2015 impairments 2016 earnings were lower because of 

  

unfavorable contract pricing on longterm supply agreements as well as unfavorable permian to gulf coast differentials decreased throughput and lower realized ngls pricing 

business review 

pipeline transportation 

margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped dolphin energy owns and operates a 230milelong 48inchdiameter natural gas pipeline dolphin pipeline which transports dry natural gas from qatar to the uae and oman the dolphin pipeline contributes significantly to occidentals pipeline transportation results through occidentals 245percent interest in dolphin energy the dolphin pipeline has capacity to transport up to 32 bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 22 bcf per day and up to 25 bcf per day in the summer dolphin pipeline is currently expanding gas compression facilities to achieve maximum pipeline capacity occidental believes substantial opportunities remain to provide gas transportation to additional customers in the region to reach the full capacity of the dolphin pipeline and generate additional midstream revenues and cash flows 

occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2900 miles of pipelines from southeast new mexico across the permian basin in west texas to cushing oklahoma the system has a current throughput capacity of about 720000 barrels per day 71 million barrels of active storage capability and 128 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline 

occidentals 2016 pipeline transportation earnings declined from 2015 due to lower throughput volumes 

gas processing plants and co 2  fields and facilities 

occidental processes its and thirdparty domestic wet gas to extract ngls and other gas byproducts including co 2  and delivers dry gas to pipelines margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for ngls occidental’s 2016 earnings from these operations decreased compared to 2015 due to lower realized ngl pricing 

occidental together with adnoc developed al hosn gas in abu dhabi of which occidental has a 40percent participating interest al hosn gas is designed to process 10 bcf per day of natural gas and separate it into sales gas condensate ngls and sulfur the processing facilities include processing and treatment facilities sulfur recovery units including facilities to extract sulfur from natural gas and to load and store sulfur the facilities produce approximately 10000 tons per day of sulfur of which approximately 4000 tons is occidentals share al hosn gas facilities generates revenues from gas processing fees and the sale of sulfur the decrease in 2016 earnings compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sulfur pricing 

power generation facilities 

earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties the 

 

increase in earnings in 2016 compared to 2015 was a result of higher production due to fewer outages 

marketing 

the marketing group markets substantially all of occidental’s oil ngls and gas production as well as trades around its assets including its own and third party transportation and storage capacity occidental’s thirdparty marketing activities focus on purchasing oil ngls and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets these purchases allow occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets marketing performance in 2016 declined compared to 2015 due to unfavorable permian to gulf coast crude oil price differentials 

industry outlook 

the pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable marketing results can have significant volatile results depending on significant price swings as well as permian to gulf coast crude oil differentials occidental continues to actively focus on marketing its commodity production to generate maximum value for its stakeholders the gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending mostly on ngls prices which cannot reasonably be predicted generally higher ngls prices result in higher profitability 

segment results of operations and significant items affecting earnings 

segment earnings exclude income taxes interest income interest expense environmental remediation expenses unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments equity investments seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in occidentals consolidated quarterly earnings during the year 

the statements of income and cash flows and supplemental oil and gas information related to california resources have been treated as discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2014 the assets and liabilities of california resources were removed from occidentals consolidated balance sheet as of november 30 2014 because of the spinoff from occidental 

  

the following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items 



see footnotes following significant transactions and events affecting occidentals earnings 

the following table sets forth significant transactions and events affecting occidental’s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature timing and amount 



 

 

oil and gas 



the following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil ngls and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2016  the differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at occidental’s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers 

  





 



  







  



 

oil and gas segment results were losses of 06 billion and 81 billion in 2016 and 2015 respectively and income of 04 billion in 2014 the 2016 results for the oil and gas segment included pretax gains of 107 million mainly comprised of the sales of piceance and south texas assets and net charges of 61 million related to the sale of libya and exit from iraq 

oil and gas segment results in 2015 included pretax impairment and related charges of 35 billion and 50 billion on domestic and international assets respectively approximately 13 billion of the domestic impairment and related charges were due to the exit of occidental’s operations in the williston basin which was sold in november 2015 and in the piceance basin which was sold in march 2016 the remaining domestic charges were due to the significant decline in the futures price curve as well as management’s decision not to pursue development activities associated with certain nonproducing acreage internationally the impairments and related charges were due to a combination of occidental’s strategic plan to exit or reduce our exposure in certain middle east and north africa operations as well as the decline in the futures price curve which have made certain projects in the region unprofitable earnings in 2014 included pretax charges of 53 billion related to the impairment of domestic and international assets and the gain from the sale of hugoton assets 

domestic oil and gas segment results were losses of 16 billion 42 billion and 24 billion in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively excluding the significant items noted above the decrease in domestic oil and gas results in 2016 compared to 2015 reflected significantly lower realized oil prices which had decreased by 13 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and higher dda rates to a lesser extent the lower 2016 results also reflected lower oil volumes due to the sale of noncore domestic operations the decrease in results compared to 2015 were partially offset by lower cash operating expenses 

similar to domestic results and excluding the significant items noted above the decrease in international earnings in 2016 compared to 2015 reflected significantly 

 

lower realized crude oil prices which had decreased by 23 percent in the middle east and 16 percent in latin america partially offset by lower dda rates 

average production costs for 2016 excluding taxes other than on income were 1076 per boe compared to 

1157 per boe for 2015 the decrease in average costs reflected lower maintenance workover and support costs as a result of improvements in operating efficiencies especially in the domestic operations 

average daily production volumes were 630000 boe and 668000 boe for 2016 and 2015 respectively and included production from assets sold or exited of 28000 boe and 103000 boe for 2016 and 2015 respectively excluding production for assets sold or exited average daily production volumes were 602000 boe and 565000 boe for 2016 and 2015 respectively the increase in production from ongoing operations mainly reflected higher production from al hosn gas as it was not fully operational in 2015 and higher production from permian resources which increased its 2016 production by 13 percent compared to 2015 these increases were offset by lower production from south texas and other due to curtailed drilling 

in addition to the impairments and related charges noted above the decrease in domestic oil and gas segment results in 2015 compared to 2014 reflected significantly lower crude oil ngl and natural gas prices partially offset by higher crude oil production volumes and lower operating costs from lower workover and maintenance costs and lower dda expenses the decrease in international earnings reflected lower realized crude oil prices partially offset by higher sales volumes 

average daily production volumes were 668000 boe and 597000 boe for 2015 and 2014 respectively and included 103000 boe and 111000 boe of production from assets sold or exited in 2015 and 2014 respectively excluding production for assets sold or exited average daily production volumes were 565000 boe and 486000 boe for 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in on going production reflected the commencement of production at al hosn in 2015 along with a 47 percent increase in production from permian resources 

average production costs for 2015 excluding taxes other than on income were 1157 per boe compared to 1350 per boe in 2014 the decrease in average costs reflected decreased activity in downhole maintenance and lower overall cost structure 

chemical 



chemical segment earnings were 571 million 542 million and 420 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively included in 2016 earnings are a pretax gain on sale of 57 million from the sale of the occidental tower building in dallas and a 31 million pretax gain from the sale of a noncore specialty chemicals business included in 2015 earnings are pretax asset impairments of 121 million and a pretax gain on sale of 98 million from the 

  

sale of an idled facility excluding these significant items the decrease in 2016 earnings compared to 2015 reflected lower pvc margins as pvc pricing decreased with lower ethylene pricing which was partially offset by lower ethylene and energy costs 

segment earnings for 2014 included asset impairments of 149 million excluding these significant items the decrease in 2015 earnings compared to 2014 reflected lower caustic soda pricing and lower sales volumes across most products offset by improved pvc margins resulting primarily from lower energy and ethylene costs 

midstream and marketing 



midstream and marketing segment results were losses of 04 billion and 12 billion in 2016 and 2015 respectively and earnings of 26 billion in 2014 included in 2016 results was a 160 million charge related to the termination of crude oil supply contracts included in 2015 results were impairments and related charges of 13 billion included in 2014 earnings were 20 billion of gains from the sale of bridgetex pipeline and part of occidentals investment in plains pipeline excluding the significant items noted above the decrease in 2016 results compared to 2015 reflected lower marketing margins due to unfavorable contract pricing on longterm supply agreements as well as unfavorable permian to gulf coast differentials decreased throughput and lower realized ngls pricing excluding the significant items noted above the decrease in 2015 results compared to 2014 primarily reflected lower marketing margins due to the narrowing of the permian to gulf coast differentials lower domestic gas processing income due to lower ngl prices and lower dolphin pipeline income and the decrease in occidentals interest in plains pipeline 

taxes 

deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets of 23 billion were 11 billion at december 31 2016  the deferred tax assets net of allowances are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences 

 

worldwide effective tax rate 

the following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations 



 

occidentals 2016  worldwide effective tax rate was 40 percent which is higher than the 2015  rate mainly due to the mix of domestic operating losses and foreign operating income tax credits and tax benefits resulting from the write off of exploration blocks excluding the impact of impairments and other nonrecurring items occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate for 2016 would be 24 percent 

a deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries as it is occidental’s intention to reinvest such earnings permanently if the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested an additional deferred tax liability of approximately 116 million would be required assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits 

consolidated results of operations 

changes in components of occidentals results of continuing operations are discussed below 

revenue and other income items 



the decrease in net sales in 2016  compared to 2015  was mainly due to the decline in average worldwide realized oil prices in 2016 and a decline in worldwide production as occidental exited noncore areas average worldwide realized oil prices fell by approximately 18 percent from 2015 to 2016 

the decrease in net sales in 2015  compared to 2014  was due to a significant decline in worldwide oil ngls and gas prices partially offset by higher domestic and international crude oil volumes average wti and brent 

  

prices fell by nearly 50 percent and nymex gas prices fell by over 35 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 prices 

price and volume changes in the oil and gas segment generally represent the majority of the change in oil and gas segment sales which is a substantially larger portion of the overall change in sales than the chemical and midstream and marketing segments 

the 2016 gain on sale included the sale of piceance and south texas oil and gas properties the occidental tower building in dallas and a noncore specialty chemicals business the 2015 gain on sale included 98 million for the sale of an idled chemical facility the 2014 gain on sale included 14 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in plains pipeline 633 million for the sale of bridgetex pipeline and 531 million for the sale of hugoton properties 

expense items 



cost of sales decreased in 2016 from the prior year due primarily to lower oil and gas maintenance costs and lower chemical feedstock and energy costs cost of sales decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment lower fuel costs in the power generation operations and lower worldwide production costs including workovers and downhole maintenance costs 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a lower compensation accruals in 2015 related to occidentals decision not to pay bonuses 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower compensation expense 

dda expense decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to lower volumes from the exited noncore oil and gas operations and lower dda rates in the middle east dda expense increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to higher production volumes partially offset by lower dda rates 

in 2016 occidental incurred impairment and related items charges of 825 million of which 541 million related to a reserve for doubtful accounts and 160 million for the termination of crude oil supply contracts 78 million related to the disposal of crc stock and 61 million related to exits from libya and iraq 

asset impairments and related items in 2015 of 102 billion included charges of 35 billion related to domestic oil and gas assets due to occidental’s exit from the williston and piceance basins as well as the decline in the futures price curve and management’s decision not to pursue activities associated with certain nonproducing acreage 

 

international oil and gas charges of 50 billion were due to a combination of occidental’s strategic plan to exit or reduce its exposure in certain middle east and north africa operations as well as the decline in the futures price curve which have made certain projects in the region unprofitable midstream charges of 13 billion included the impairment of occidental’s century gas processing plant as a result of sandridge’s inability to provide volumes to the plant and meet their contractual obligations to deliver co 2  occidental recorded an otherthantemporary loss of 227 million for its available for sale investment in california resources 

asset impairments and related items in 2014 of 74 billion included 28 billion in the williston basin 904 million related to occidentals gas and ngls assets 889 million for other domestic acreage and 11 billion primarily related to operations in bahrain and other international operations asset impairments also include charges for joslyn oil sands of 805 million and an other than temporary loss of 553 million for the available for sale investment in california resources stock 

taxes other than on income decreased in 2016 from 2015 due primarily to lower production taxes which are directly tied to lower commodity prices taxes other than on income in 2015 decreased from 2014 due primarily to lower oil ngl and gas prices which resulted in lower ad valorem and severance taxes 

other items 



the benefit from income taxes decreased in 2016 from the prior year as a result of a lower net loss in 2016 compared to 2015 which reflected significant impairments and related items charges the provision for income taxes decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the pretax loss in 2015 as a result of the lower price environment and impairments and related charges 

the decline in income from equity investments in 2016 from 2015 is the result of lower dolphin gas sales the decline in 2015 from 2014 is a result of the lower dolphin gas sales occidentals reduced ownership in plains pipeline and the expiration of occidentals contract in yemen block 10 where occidental held an equity interest 

discontinued operations net in 2016 and 2015 of 428 and 317 million respectively primarily include settlement payments by the republic of ecuador see note 2 of the consolidated financial statements 

  

consolidated analysis of financial position 

the changes in select components of occidental’s balance sheet are discussed below 



assets 

see liquidity and capital resources — cash flow analysis for discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 

the increase in trade receivables net was the result of improved oil and gas prices at the end of 2016 compared to the end of 2015 average december wti and brent prices were below 4000 per barrel in 2015 compared to over 5000 per barrel in 2016 inventories decreased as a result of lower materials and supplies inventories in the oil and gas segment the decrease in assets held for sale is the result of the sale of piceance oil and gas properties and the dallas tower office building other current assets increased as a result of receivables recorded for federal and state tax refunds anticipated on the net loss carryback the increase in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to contributions to the ethylene cracker joint venture which were partially offset by distributions from dolphin energy and plains all american pipeline company the decrease in the available for sale investment is due to the complete distribution of occidentals retained interest in california resources as a special stock dividend in the first quarter of 2016 the increase in ppe net was due to capital expenditures and the fourth quarter permian acquisitions which were partially offset by dda 

liabilities and stockholders equity 

the increase in accounts payable reflected higher marketing payables as a result of higher oil and gas prices at the end of 2016 compared to the end of 2015 liabilities of assets held for sale were transferred with the sale of the piceance properties in the first quarter of 2016 

 

the decrease in deferred credits and other liabilitiesincome taxes was due to the decrease in the difference between the book and tax basis of occidentals oil and gas properties the increase in deferred credits and other liabilities was primarily due to the additional asset retirement obligation aro recorded related to the permian acquisitions and newly drilled wells and additional environmental liabilities recorded for maxus indemnified sites the decrease in stockholders equity reflected the distribution of cash dividends and the 2016 net loss 

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2016  occidental had approximately 22 billion  in cash and cash equivalents a substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the united states income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segments prices sales volumes and costs 

occidental utilized the remaining restricted cash balance resulting from the spinoff of california resources in the first quarter of 2016 to retire debt and pay dividends 

in november 2016 occidental issued 15 billion of senior notes comprised of 750 million of 30percent senior notes due 2027 and 750 million of 41percent senior notes due 2047 occidental received net proceeds of 149 billion interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually in arrears in february and august each year for each series of senior notes beginning august 15 2017 occidental will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes 

in may and june 2016 respectively occidental utilized part of the proceeds from the april 2016 senior note offering described below to exercise the early redemption option on 125 billion of 175percent senior notes due in the first quarter of 2017 and to retire all 750 million of 4125percent senior notes that matured in june 2016 

in april 2016 occidental issued 275 billion of senior notes comprised of 04 billion of 26percent senior notes due 2022 115 billion of 34percent senior notes due 2026 and 12 billion of 44percent senior notes due 2046 occidental received net proceeds of approximately 272 billion interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually in arrears in april and october of each year for each series of senior notes beginning on october 15 2016 occidental used a portion of the proceeds to retire debt in may and june 2016 and will use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes 

in february 2016 occidental retired 700 million of 25percent senior notes that had matured 

in june 2015 occidental issued 15 billion of debt that was comprised of 750 million of 350percent senior unsecured notes due 2025 and 750 million of 4625percent senior unsecured notes due 2045 occidental received net proceeds of approximately 148 billion interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears in june and december of each year for both series of notes beginning on december 15 2015 

in august 2014 occidental entered into a new fiveyear 20 billion bank credit facility credit facility in order to replace its previous 20 billion bank credit facility which was scheduled to expire in october 2016 the 2014 credit 

  

facility does not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict occidentals ability to borrow under this facility occidental did not draw down any amounts under the credit facility during 2016  or 2015 and no amounts were outstanding as of december 31 2016  

as of december 31 2016  under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on or acquisitions of occidental stock 

occidental expects to fund its liquidity needs including future dividend payments through cash on hand cash generated from operations monetization of noncore assets or investments and through future borrowings and if necessary proceeds from other forms of capital issuance 

cash flow analysis 



cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2016 decreased 07 billion to 25 billion from 33 billion in 2015 operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower worldwide average realized oil prices in the first half of 2016 which on a yearoveryear basis declined 18 percent the effect of lower commodity prices was partially offset by lower operating costs especially in the oil and gas segment where year over year production costs decreased by 7 percent cash flows from continuing operations in 2016 also included collections of 325 million of federal and state tax refunds the usage of working capital in 2016 reflected an increase in receivables as oil prices were much higher at the end of 2016 compared to the end of 2015 operating cash flows from discontinued operations reflected the collection of the ecuador settlement 

cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2015 decreased 56 billion to 33 billion from 89 billion in 2014 operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower worldwide realized oil ngls and natural gas prices throughout 2015 which on a yearoveryear basis declined 48 percent 57 percent and 42 percent respectively the effect of lower commodity prices was partially offset by higher production and lower operating costs the usage of working capital in 2015 reflected lower realized prices that impacted receivable collections and payments related to higher capital and operating spending accrued in the fourth quarter of 2014 and paid in 2015 

other cost elements such as labor costs and overhead are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flows than changes 

 

in oil and gas product prices sales volumes and operating costs 

the chemical and midstream and marketing segments cash flows are significantly smaller and their overall cash flows are generally less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment 



occidental’s net capital expenditures declined by 27 billion in 2016 to 29 billion after contributions to the oxychem ingleside facility which is included in other investing activities the decline was a result of the oil and gas budget reduction due to lower commodity price environment and reductions in spending on longterm projects such as the oxychem ingleside facility which is expected to come on line in early 2017 

occidentals net capital expenditures declined 31 billion in 2015 to 56 billion after contributions to the oxychem ingleside facility which was included in other investing activities the decline was the result of lower spending in oil and gas noncore operations in the united states and middle east and reduced expenditures on longterm projects coming on line at the end of 2014 

while the 2017 environment remains challenging occidental remains committed to allocating capital to only its highest return projects occidentals 2017 capital spending is expected to be in the range of 30 billion to 36 billion 

in 2016 cash flows used in other investing activities of 20 billion is comprised primarily of the acquisition of acreage in the permian in october 2016 

in 2015 cash flows used in other investing activities of 01 billion is comprised primarily of changes in the capital accrual and asset purchases offset by the sales of equity investments and assets 

capital commitments for longterm projects currently under construction in the midstream and chemicals segment in 2017 are planned to be approximately 140 million 



  

cash provided by financing activities in 2016 was 04 billion as compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2015 of 15 billion financing activities in 2016 included proceeds from long term debt of 42 billion and payments of long term debt of 27 billion occidental used restricted cash of 12 billion to pay dividends and retire debt 

cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was 15 billion as compared to cash used by financing activities in 2014 of 22 billion financing activities in 2015 included proceeds from long term debt of 15 billion occidental used restricted cash of 28 billion to pay dividends and purchase treasury stock 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of occidentals offbalancesheet arrangements 

guarantees 

occidental has guaranteed its portion of equity method investees debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds letters of credit indemnities and commitments provided by occidental to third parties mainly to provide assurance that opc or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees as of december 31 2016  occidental’s guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately 296 million of dolphin’s debt the fair value of the guarantees was immaterial 

occidental has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries for various letters of credit indemnities and commitments 

see oil and gas segment — business review — qatar and “segment results of operations” for further information about dolphin 

leases 

occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements mainly for transportation equipment power plants machinery terminals storage facilities land and office space occidental leases assets when leasing offers greater operating flexibility lease payments are generally expensed as part of cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses for more information see contractual obligations 

 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes and crossreferences occidental’s contractual obligations this summary indicates on and offbalancesheet obligations as of december 31 2016  



 

delivery commitments 

occidental has commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil natural gas and ngls the domestic volumes contracted to be delivered which are not presented in note 7 of the consolidated financial statements are approximately 81 million barrels of oil through 2025 5 bcf of gas through 2017 and 11 million barrels of ngls through 2018 the price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall 

lawsuits claims and contingencies 

occidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property damage or other losses punitive damages civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar federal state local and foreign environmental laws these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases 

  

compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties and injunctive relief usually occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies further some lawsuits claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction 

in accordance with applicable accounting guidance occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated in note 8 occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental remediation matters that satisfy these criteria reserve balances for matters other than environmental remediation that satisfy these criteria as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 were not material to occidental’s consolidated balance sheets 

occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings and discloses its estimable range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses for nonenvironmental matters that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available 

tax matters 

during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax jurisdictions although taxable years through 2009 for united states federal income tax purposes have been audited by the united states internal revenue service irs pursuant to its compliance assurance program subsequent taxable years are currently under review additionally in december 2012 occidental filed united states federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 that are subject to irs review taxable years from 2002 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions in certain of these jurisdictions tax authorities are in various stages of auditing occidental’s income taxes during the course of tax audits disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

indemnities to third parties 

occidental its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these indemnities usually are contingent upon 

 

the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2016 occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality 

the laws that require or address environmental remediation including cercla and similar federal state local and foreign laws may apply retroactively and regardless of fault the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites opc or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating closed and thirdparty sites remedial activities may include one or more of the following investigation involving sampling modeling risk assessment or monitoring cleanup measures including removal treatment or disposal or operation and maintenance of remedial systems the environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties injunctive relief and government oversight costs 

environmental remediation 

as of december 31 2016  occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 147 sites the following table presents occidental’s environmental remediation reserves as of december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities 131 million in 2016 70 million in 2015 and 79 million in 2014 and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities — other 739 million in 2016 316 million in 2015 and 255 million in 2014 the reserves are grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the us environmental protection agency on the cercla national priorities list npl sites and three categories of nonnpl sites — thirdparty sites occidentaloperated sites and closed or nonoperated occidental sites 



as of december 31 2016  occidental’s environmental reserves exceeded 10 million each at 16 of the 147 sites 

  

described above and 88 of the sites had reserves from 0 to 1 million each 

as of december 31 2016 three sites — the diamond alkali superfund site and a former chemical plant in ohioboth of which are indemnified by maxus energy corporation as discussed further below and a landfill in western new york — accounted for 95 percent of its reserves associated with npl sites the reserve balance above includes 17 npl sites subject to indemnification by maxus 

four of the 68 thirdparty sites a maxusindemnified chrome site in new jersey a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee an active plant outside of the united states and an active refinery in louisiana where occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities accounted for 53 percent of occidental’s reserves associated with these sites the reserve balance above includes 9 thirdparty sites subject to indemnification by maxus 

three sites chemical plants in kansas louisiana and texas accounted for 48 percent of the reserves associated with the occidentaloperated sites 

six other sites a landfill in western new york former chemical plants in tennessee delaware washington and california and a closed coal mine in pennsylvania — accounted for 69 percent of the reserves associated with closed or nonoperated occidental sites 

when occidental acquired diamond shamrock chemicals company dscc in 1986 maxus energy corporation maxus currently a subsidiary of ypf sa ypf agreed to indemnify occidental for a number of environmental sites including the diamond alkali superfund site site along a portion of the passaic river on june 17 2016 maxus and several affiliated companies filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal district court in the state of delaware prior to filing for bankruptcy maxus defended and indemnified occidental in connection with cleanup and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity including the site occidental is pursuing maxus and its parent company ypf as the alter ego of maxus to recover all indemnified costs which will include costs to be incurred at the site 

in march 2016 the epa issued a record of decision rod specifying remedial actions required for the lower 83 miles of the lower passaic river the rod does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river or newark bay during the third quarter of 2016 and following maxus’s bankruptcy filing occidental and the epa entered into an administrative order on consent aoc to complete the design of the proposed cleanup plan outlined in the rod at an estimated cost of 165 million the epa announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties 

occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and the remediation called for in the aoc and the rod as well as for certain other maxusindemnified sites occidental’s ultimate share of this liability may be higher or lower than the reserved amount and is subject to final design plans and the resolution of occidentals allocable share with other potentially responsible parties occidental 

 

continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the aoc the rod and to perform remediation at other maxusindemnified sites in light of the maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties 

environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation 

based on current estimates occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to 10 billion 

environmental costs 

occidental’s environmental costs some of which include estimates are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended december 31 



operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures relate to longerlived improvements in properties currently operated by occidental remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations 

occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately 89 million for 2017  

foreign investments 

many of occidental’s assets are located outside north america at december 31 2016  the carrying value of occidental’s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately 95 billion or 22 percent of occidental’s total assets at that date of such assets approximately 82 billion are located in the middle east and approximately 10 billion are located in latin america for the year ended december 31 2016  net sales outside north america totaled 37 billion or approximately 37 percent of total net sales 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

  

requires occidentals management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts there has been no material change to occidentals critical accounting policies over the past three years the selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve managements judgment 

oil and gas properties 

the carrying value of occidental’s ppe represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest net of accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization dda and any impairment charges for assets acquired ppe cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets 

occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found if proved reserves have been found the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized otherwise occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense in some cases a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12month period after drilling is complete 

occidental expenses annual lease rentals the costs of injectants used in production and geological geophysical and seismic costs as incurred 

occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unitofproduction method it amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 

 

several factors could change occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves for example occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices in other cases particularly with longlived properties lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical for such properties higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded in 2016  positive revisions of previous estimates of 159 million boe were primarily positive technical revisions in al hosn gas and price revisions in oman due to the psc impact partially offset by negative domestic price revisions 

additionally occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable if there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices significant changes in reserve estimates changes in managements plans or other significant events management will evaluate the property for impairment under the successful efforts method if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows which is generally on a field by field basis the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants the impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time these assumptions include estimates of future product prices contractual prices estimates of riskadjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs it is reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in other additional impairments 

the most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in occidentals oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the dda rate for example a 5 percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the dda rate by approximately 060 per barrel which would 

  

increase or decrease pretax income by approximately 140 million annually at current production rates 

a portion of the carrying value of occidental’s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were 14 billion and 03 billion at december 31 2016  and 2015 respectively the unproved amounts are not subject to dda until they are classified as proved properties capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to dda when proved reserves are assigned to the property if the exploration efforts are unsuccessful or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices higher development and operating costs contractual conditions or other factors the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed the timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties if warranted depends upon managements plans the nature timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance 

chemical assets 

occidentals chemical assets are depreciated using either the unitofproduction or the straightline method based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets which range from three years to 50 years are also used for impairment tests the estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance as well as planned major maintenance activities pmma ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred pmma costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul additionally occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use these capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service the resulting revision if any of the asset’s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively 

without these continued expenditures the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition demand feedstock costs energy prices environmental regulations and technological changes 

occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets any impairment 

 

loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

occidentals net ppe for the chemical segment is approximately 24 billion and its depreciation expense for 2017 is expected to be approximately 300 million the most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical plants would be on depreciation expense for example a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pretax earnings by approximately 45 million per year 

midstream marketing and other assets 

derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cashflow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment otherwise any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period for cashflow hedges the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income oci with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged realized gains or losses from cashflow hedges and any ineffective portion are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location quality grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of operations there were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 

a hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if at inception and throughout its life it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows respectively of the hedging instrument in the case of hedging a forecast transaction the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable 

occidentals midstream and marketing ppe is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using either the unitofproduction or straightline method occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

  

fair value measurements 

occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a threelevel fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation techniques level 1 – using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities level 2 – using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities and level 3 – using unobservable inputs transfers between levels if any are recognized at the end of each reporting period 

fair values  recurring 

occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs occidental utilizes the midpoint between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value in addition to using market data occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique for assets and liabilities carried at fair value occidental measures fair value using the following methods 

 Ø overthecounter otc bilateral financial commodity contracts foreign exchange contracts options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industrystandard models that consider various inputs including quoted forward prices for commodities time value volatility factors credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments as well as other relevant economic measures substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 

 

occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a marketobservable price for an identical or similar asset or liability this approach utilizes managements judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows and discounts those cash flows using a riskadjusted discount rate 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

environmental expenditures that relate to current 

 

operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience remedial objectives available technologies applicable laws and regulations and costsharing arrangements occidental bases environmental reserves on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred using the most costeffective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established the reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established presently none of the environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received or when receipt of recovery is highly probable 

many factors could affect occidental’s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses the most significant are 1 cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate 2 the length of time type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination 3 a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify occidental’s proposed remedial plan 4 improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs 5 laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability and 6 changes in allocation or costsharing arrangements may occur 

certain sites involve multiple parties with various costsharing arrangements which fall into the following three categories 1 environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties 2 oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest or 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of properties in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs in these circumstances occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate when estimating occidentals ultimate share of liability occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and based on these factors believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of 

  

such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved 

in addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures which often take in excess of 10 years at npl sites occidentals reserves include managements estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly 

if occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings for example if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent occidental would record a pretax gain of 87 million if the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 87 million 

other loss contingencies 

occidental is involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings and audits occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis 

loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate management’s judgments could change based on new information changes in or interpretations of laws or regulations changes in management’s plans or intentions opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings or other factors see lawsuits claims and contingencies for additional information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

commodity price risk 

general 

occidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil ngls and natural gas prices price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect occidental’s pretax annual income by approximately 120 million for a 1 per barrel change in oil prices and 30 million for a 1 per barrel change in ngls prices if domestic natural gas prices varied by 050 per mcf it would have an estimated annual effect on occidentals pretax income of approximately 50 million these pricechange sensitivities include the impact of psc and similar contract volume changes on income if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidental’s results to prices also will change marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil natural gas and to a lesser degree other commodities these sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing volumes and cannot be predicted reliably 

occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices a variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of 10 per ton would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 10 million and 30 million respectively a variation in pvc prices of 001  per lb would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 30 million historically over time product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins according to ihs chemical or townsend 2016  average contract prices were chlorine—298 per ton caustic soda—645 per ton and pvc—038 per lb 

occidental uses derivative instruments including a combination of shortterm futures forwards options and swaps to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas 

  

risk management 

occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies the controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check members of the risk management group report to the corporate vice president and treasurer controls for these activities include limits 

  

on value at risk limits on credit limits on total notional trade value segregation of duties delegation of authority daily price verifications reporting to senior management of various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls 

  

fair value of marketing derivative contracts 

occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value fair values for these contracts are derived from level 1 and level 2 sources the fair values in future maturity periods are insignificant 

the following table shows the fair value of occidentals derivatives excluding collateral segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation 



  

cashflow hedges 

occidental’s marketing operations from time to time store natural gas purchased from third parties at occidental’s north american leased storage facilities at december 31 2016 occidental had approximately 7 bcf of natural gas held in storage and had cashflow hedges for the forecast sale to be settled by physical delivery of approximately 7 bcf of stored natural gas as of december 31 2015 occidental had approximately 13 bcf of natural gas held in storage and had cashflow hedges for the forecast sale to be settled by physical delivery of approximately 14 bcf of stored natural gas 

  

quantitative information 

occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities this measure determines the maximum potential negative one day change in fair value with a 95 percent level of confidence additionally occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice as a result of these controls occidental has determined that market risk of its trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance 

  

interest rate risk 

general 

occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variablerate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2016  variablerate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of occidentals total debt 

  

foreign currency risk 

occidental’s foreign operations have limited currency risk occidental manages its exposure primarily by 

 

balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes a vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in united states dollars additionally all of occidental’s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the united states dollar as the functional currency as of december 31 2016  the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the marketing operations was immaterial the effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income 

tabular presentation of interest rate risk 

the table below provides information about occidentals debt obligations debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date 



 

credit risk 

the majority of occidentals counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong by entering into master netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants as appropriate occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis 

certain of occidentals otc derivative instruments contain creditriskcontingent features primarily tied to credit ratings for occidental or its counterparties which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post occidental believes that if it had received a onenotch reduction in its credit ratings it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateralposting requirements as of december 31 2016  and 2015  

as of december 31 2016  the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties occidental believes its exposure to creditrelated losses at december 31 2016  was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented

available information 

occidental makes the following information available free of charge on its website at wwwoxycom 

 information contained on occidentals website is not part of this report 




 item 1a risk factors 

volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidentals financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products particularly oil and to a lesser extent natural gas and ngls and its chemical products 

prices for crude oil natural gas and ngls fluctuate widely historically the markets for crude oil natural gas ngls and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future prolonged or further declines in crude oil natural gas and ngls prices would continue to reduce occidentals operating results and cash flows and could impact its future rate of growth and further impact the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets 

prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in occidentals control these factors include among others 



 

 

the longterm effects of these and other conditions on the prices of crude oil natural gas ngls and refined products are uncertain generally occidentals practice is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities however management may elect to hedge the price risk of crude oil natural gas ngls and refined products in the future 

recent global economic and political conditions have driven oil and gas prices down significantly these conditions may continue for an extended period continued reductions in commodity prices could require occidental to further reduce capital spending share repurchases and impair the carrying value of assets 

the prices obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the united states and global economies as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

occidentals restructuring activities may affect its stock price 

occidental has performed a strategic review of its operations which has resulted in the restructuring and the separation or divestiture of various assets this activity and further implementation of the strategic review may affect the market value of occidentals common stock for example occidental may take different actions than expected receive less proceeds or retain more liabilities than anticipated in connection with any divestitures 

occidental may experience delays cost overruns losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities 

occidental bears the risks of equipment failures construction delays escalating costs or competition for services materials supplies or labor property or border disputes disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance and other associated risks that may affect its 

  

ability to profitably grow production replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns 

exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses 

governmental actions and political instability may affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s businesses are subject to the decisions of many federal state local and foreign governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 

 in addition occidental has and may continue to experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability nationalizations corruption armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources 

occidentals oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves 

results of operations reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend in part on occidental’s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves occidental has many competitors including national oil companies some of which i are larger and better funded ii may be willing to accept greater risks or iii have special competencies competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts in addition during periods of low product prices any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts 

occidental’s acquisition activities also carry risks that it may i not fully realize anticipated benefits due to less 

 

thanexpected reserves or production or changed circumstances such as the deterioration of natural gas prices in recent years and the more recent significant decline in crude oil prices ii bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties iii experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity or iv assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated 

occidental’s oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability including production decline rates operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices future operating costs and capital expenditures as well as assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies the procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants however there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves actual production revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates and the variance may be material if occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected in addition the discounted cash flows included in this form 10k should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted 12month average firstdayofthemonth prices in accordance with sec regulations actual future prices and costs may differ materially from sec regulationcompliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves 

concerns about climate change and other air quality issues may affect occidental’s operations or results 

the adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require occidental to incur increased operating costs such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for products that occidental’s businesses produce any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming and thereby reduce demand for products produced by occidental’s businesses consequently legislation and regulatory programs designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on occidental’s business financial condition and results of operations however the certainty and timing of these potential effects are unknown 

  

occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic events 

the occurrence of events such as hurricanes floods droughts earthquakes other acts of nature well blowouts fires explosions chemical releases material or mechanical failure industrial accidents physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses 

cyber attacks could significantly affect occidental 

cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years occidental relies on electronic systems and networks to control and manage its oil and gas chemicals trading and pipeline operations and has multiple layers of security to mitigate risks of cyber attack if however occidental were to experience an attack and its security measures were compromised the potential consequences to its businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant 

occidentals oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business 

 unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities acquire properties containing proved reserves or both proved reserves will generally decline management expects improved recovery extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors such as geology government regulations and permits and the effectiveness of development plans are partially or fully outside managements control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations 

other risk factors

strategy 

general 

through its operations occidental aims to maximize total returns to stockholders using the following strategies 

 in conducting its business occidental accepts commodity engineering and limited exploration risks capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks 

price volatility is inherent in the oil and gas business and in 2015 oil natural gas and ngls prices continued the downward trend started in the fourth quarter of 2014 in order to manage this risk occidental strives to retain sufficient cash on hand and maintain a low debt to capitalization ratio which allows occidental access to capital markets 

in connection with occidentals strategic review initiatives occidental 

 

as a result of exiting noncore operations occidental expects improved margins through lower cash operating costs selling general and administrative costs and reduced capital spending in the future 

 

the following describes the application of occidental’s overall strategy for each of its operating segments 

oil and gas 

the oil and gas business implements occidentals strategy primarily by 

 in 2015 oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately 44 billion and were mainly comprised of expenditures in the permian basin and the middle east this activity reflects occidentals strategy to focus on achieving returns above the cost of capital even in a low price environment 

management believes occidentals oil and gas segment growth will occur primarily through exploitation and development opportunities in the permian basin and colombia and focused international projects in the middle east 

chemical 

the primary objective of oxychem is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve abovecostofcapital returns the chemical segments strategy is to be a lowcost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine which is coproduced with caustic soda and markets both to third parties in addition chlorine together with ethylene is converted through a series of intermediate products into polyvinyl chloride pvc oxychems focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chloralkali and pvc businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities in early 

  

2014 oxychem through a 5050 joint venture with mexichem sab de cv broke ground on a 12 billion poundperyear ethylene cracker at the oxychem ingleside facility the joint venture provides an opportunity to capitalize on the advantage that us shale gas development has presented to us chemical producers by providing lowcost ethane as a raw material the construction of the ethylene cracker remains on budget and schedule and is expected to begin operating in early 2017 in 2015 capital expenditures for oxychem totaled 594 million approximately twothirds of which was spent on the mexichem joint venture in the third quarter oxychem sold an idled facility 

midstream and marketing 

the midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing use of its assets including its transportation and storage capacity and by providing access to multiple markets in order to generate returns the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to other occidental segments as well as third parties the segment invests and operates pipeline systems gas plants cogeneration facilities and storage facilities the segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas power and other commodities used in occidentals businesses while limiting credit risk exposure capital is employed to sustain or where appropriate increase operational and transportation capacity and to improve the competitiveness of occidentals assets in 2015 capital expenditures totaled 535 million of which a majority was related to the al hosn gas processing facilities crude oil terminal and permian basin gas processing and gathering infrastructure 

key performance indicators 

occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return in addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics

the following table presents occidentals average realized prices as a percentage of wti brent and nymex for 2015  and 2014  



the wti and brent oil price indexes declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015  closing at 3704 per barrel and 3728 per barrel respectively as of december 31 2015  the wti and brent oil price indexes were 5327 per barrel and 5733 per barrel respectively as of december 31 2014  average worldwide realized oil prices fell 4303 or 48 percent in 2015  compared to 2014  the average realized domestic natural gas price in 2015  decreased 46 percent from 2014  average wti and brent oil price indexes declined 48 percent and 46 percent from 9300 and 9951 in 2014 to 4880 and 5364 in 2015 respectively average nymex natural gas prices declined 37 percent from 434 in 2014 to 275 in 2015 

prices and differentials can vary significantly even on a shortterm basis making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty 

the decline in oil and gas prices during 2015 as well as the decision to sell or exit noncore assets caused occidental to assess the carrying value of all of its oil and gas producing assets and assess development plans for its nonproducing assets as a result in 2015 occidental recorded total pretax impairment and related charges of 35 billion for its domestic assets and 50 billion for its international assets to assess carrying value of its oil and gas assets occidental uses oil and gas price curves settled on the last trading day of each quarter any further sustained declines in commodity prices may result in additional impairments in the future 

  

operations 

2015 developments 

in november 2015 occidental sold its williston basin assets in north dakota for approximately 590 million occidentals share of production for the williston operations was approximately 16000 boe per day in 2015 

in december 2015 occidental entered into an agreement to sell its piceance basin operations in colorado for approximately 155 million the transaction is expected to close in march 2016 the assets and liabilities of the piceance operations are classified as held for sale at december 31 2015 

occidental has exited or significantly reduced its involvement in noncore operations in the middle east and north africa in iraq occidental has issued a notice of withdrawal and is working to reassign its interest in the zubair field in accordance with the contract terms in yemen occidental’s nonoperated interest in block 10 east shabwa field expired in december 2015 and in february 2016 occidental sold its interests in block s1 an nagyah field in addition occidental has been reducing its activity and exposure in bahrain and libya occidental has suspended exploration activities due to civil unrest in libya and production disruptions continued throughout 2015 due to oil field and export terminal strikes and closures less than 5 percent of the total capital spending in 2015 was allocated to these middle east operations collectively occidental’s share of production from these operations in the middle east was 72000 boe per day in 2015 

domestic interests 

occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns occidentals domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years which is extended through the end of production once it commences of the total 36 million net acres in which occidental has interests approximately 85 percent is leased 14 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights 

productionsharing contracts 

occidentals interests in oman and qatar are subject to production sharing contracts psc under such contracts occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain production costs and an additional share for profit in addition certain contracts in colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher

permian basin 

occidentals permian basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas the basin extends throughout southwest texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states accounting for approximately 16 percent of the total united states oil production occidental is the largest operator and the largest producer of oil in the permian basin with an approximate 13 percent net share of the total oil production in the basin occidental also produces and processes natural gas and ngls in the basin 

  

occidental manages its permian basin operations through two business units permian resources which includes growthoriented unconventional opportunities and permian eor enhanced oil recovery which utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques such as co 2 floods and waterfloods during 2015  focused on capital efficiency the permian operations reduced well drilling and completion costs by 33 percent per well in the permian basin occidental spent over 27 billion of capital in 2015  with 84 percent spent on permian resources assets in 2016  occidental expects to allocate approximately 21 percent of the 2016 capital budget to permian resources which will focus on areas in both the midland and delaware basins where infrastructure currently exists to achieve higher returns and approximately 17 percent to permian eor in order to add to existing facilities to increase co 2 production and injection capacity for future projects 

occidentals permian resources operations are among its fastest growing assets with over 8500 drilling locations in its horizontal inventory a sizable portion of which can be developed in a low price environment continued completion optimization the application of enhanced manufacturing principles combined with projected commercial savings is expected to increase the well inventory even further the development program largely began in 2010 continued to increase in 2015  in 2015 permian resources drilled 231 wells which included 195 horizontal wells production from permian resources comes from approximately 13200 gross wells of which 62 percent are operated by other producers on a net basis this represents approximately 5550 wells of which only 23 percent are operated by others 

permian eor operates a combination of co 2  floods and waterfloods which have similar development characteristics and ongoing monitoring and maintenance requirements due to a unique combination of characteristics the permian basin has been a leader in the implementation of co 2  enhanced oil recovery projects the permian basin’s concentration of large conventional reservoirs favorable co 2  flooding performance and the proximity to naturally occurring co 2  supply has resulted in decades of steady growth in enhanced oil production with 31 active floods and 40 years of experience permian eor is the industry leader in permian basin co 2  flooding 

occidental is an industry leader in applying this technology which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10 to 25 percent in the fields where it is employed significant opportunity remains to expand occidentals existing projects into new portions of reservoirs that thus far have only been water flooded leaving opportunity for significant additional recovery with new co 2  injection hence even small improvements in recovery efficiency can add significant reserves technology improvements such as the recent trend towards vertical expansion of the co 2  flooded interval into residual oil zone targets continue to yield more recovery from existing projects over the last few years occidental has had an ongoing program of deepening wells with 95 wells deepened in 2015  and 67 wells planned for 2016  occidental utilizes workover rigs to drill the extra depth into additional co 2  floodable sections of the reservoir these are low cost projects which can add reserves even in a low price environment permian eor 

 

has a large inventory of future co 2  projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated depending on market conditions 

the current strategy for permian eor is to invest sufficient capital to maintain current production and provide cash flow by exploiting natural synergies between permian eor and permian resources occidental is able to deliver unique advantages efficiencies and expertise across its permian basin operations occidentals share of production in the permian basin was approximately 255000 boe per day in 2015 with 110000 boe per day coming from permian resources and 145000 boe per day from permian eor

oman 

in oman occidental is the operator of block 9 and block 27 with a 50percent and 65percent working interest in each block respectively block 53 with a 45percent working interest and block 62 with an 80percent working interest 

in december 2015 the existing production sharing contract for block 9 expired and occidental agreed to operate block 9 under modified operating terms until a new contract is approved the term for block 27 expires in 2035 

a 30year psc for the mukhaizna field block 53 was signed with the government of oman in 2005 pursuant to which occidental assumed operation of the field by the end of 2015 occidental had drilled more than 2600 new wells and continued implementation of a major steamflood project in 2015 the average gross daily production was 122000 boe per day which was over 15 times higher than the production rate in september 2005 when occidental assumed operations 

in 2008 occidental was awarded a 20year contract for block 62 subject to declaration of commerciality where it is pursuing development and exploration opportunities 

  

targeting natural gas and condensate resources in 2014 occidental signed a five year extension for the initial phase for the discovered non associated gas area natural gas not in contact with crude oil in a reservoir for block 62 production commenced in block 62 in january 2016 

occidentals share of production from oman was approximately 89000 boe per day in 2015 

qatar 

in qatar occidental is the operator at idd el shargi north dome isnd and idd el shargi south dome issd with a 100percent working interest in each and al rayyan block 12 with a 925percent working interest the terms for isnd issd and block 12 expire in 2019 2022 and 2017 respectively 

occidentals dolphin investment comprises two separate economic interests through which occidental owns i a 245percent undivided interest in the upstream operations under a development and production sharing agreement with the government of qatar to develop and produce natural gas and ngls in qatar’s north field through mid2032 with a provision to request a fiveyear extension and ii a 245percent interest in the stock of dolphin energy limited dolphin energy which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in midstream and marketing segment  pipeline transportation 

occidentals share of production from qatar was approximately 107000 boe per day in 2015  

united arab emirates 

in 2011 occidental acquired a 40percent participating interest in the al hosn gas project joining with the abu dhabi national oil company adnoc in a 30year joint venture agreement the al hosn gas project became fully operational in 2015 and produced over 460 mmcf per day of natural gas and 74000 barrels per day of ngls and condensate in the fourth quarter of 2015 of which occidental’s net share is 185 mmcf per day and 29000 barrels per day respectively 

additionally the al hosn gas project includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in midstream and marketing segment  gas processing plants and co 2  fields and facilities 

occidental conducts a majority of its middle east business development activities through its office in abu dhabi which also provides various support functions for occidental’s middle eastnorth africa oil and gas operations

occidental has working interests in the la cirainfantas and teca areas and has operations within the llanos norte basin occidentals interests range from 39 to 61 percent and certain interests expire between 2023 and 2038 while others extend through the economic limit of the areas occidentals share of production was approximately 35000 boe per day in 2015  

occidental also holds working interests in the tarija chuquisaca and santa cruz regions of bolivia which produce gas occidentals share of production from bolivia was 2000 boe per day in 2015  

proved reserves 

proved oil ngls and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements oil ngls and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity quality and transportation costs for the 2015  2014   and   2013  disclosures the calculated average west texas intermediate oil prices were 5028 9499 and 9694 per barrel respectively the calculated average brent oil prices for 2015  2014   and   2013  disclosures were 5557 9951 and 10876 per barrel respectively the calculated average henry hub gas prices for 2015  2014   and   2013  were 266 442 and 365 per mmbtu respectively 

occidental had proved reserves at yearend 2015  of 2200 million boe compared to the yearend 2014  amount of 2819 million boe proved reserves at yearend 2015  and 2014  consisted of respectively 59 percent and 63 percent oil 15 percent and 13 percent ngls and 26 percent and 24 percent natural gas proved developed reserves represented approximately 79 percent and 71 percent respectively of occidental’s total proved reserves at yearend 2015  and 2014  

occidental does not have any reserves from nontraditional sources for further information regarding 

  

occidentals proved reserves see supplemental oil and gas information following the financial statements 

changes in proved reserves 

occidentals total proved reserves decreased 166 million boe in 2015  which included additions of 149 million boe from occidentals development program reduced by 315 million boe comprised primarily of price and price related revisions 

changes in reserves before production and sales of proved reserves were as follows 



occidentals ability to add reserves other than through purchases depends on the success of improved recovery extension and discovery projects each of which depends on reservoir characteristics technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices as well as capital and operating costs many of these factors are outside management’s control and may negatively or positively affect occidentals reserves 

improved recovery 

in 2015  occidental added proved reserves of 144 million boe mainly associated with the permian basin and oman operations these properties comprise both conventional projects which are characterized by the deployment of eor development methods largely employing application of co 2 flood waterflood or steam flood and unconventional projects these types of conventional eor development methods can be applied through existing wells though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells the use of either co 2  or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation the evaluation of engineering data availability and cost of either co 2  or steam and other economic factors both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells many of occidentals projects including unconventional projects rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells in addition some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells 

extensions and discoveries 

occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs in 2015  extensions and discoveries added 5 million boe related primarily to the recognition of proved developed reserves in oman 

 

purchases of proved reserves 

occidental continues to seek opportunities to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable as market conditions change the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly 

revisions of previous estimates 

revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic production decline or operating performance data in addition product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental for example lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves particularly for domestic properties because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations offsetting this effect lower prices increase occidentals share of proved reserves under pscs because more oil is required to recover costs conversely when prices rise occidentals share of proved reserves decreases for pscs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations in 2015  negative revisions of previous estimates of 315 million boe were primarily price and pricerelated revisions associated with domestic assets 

reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data 

proved undeveloped reserves 

in 2015  occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 76 million boe from improved recovery and extensions and discoveries of the total additions over 80 percent represented additions from improved recovery in the permian basin these proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by transfers of 106 million boe to the proved developed category as a result of the 2015  development programs permian basin and oman accounted for approximately 92 percent of the reserve transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2015  proved undeveloped reserves were reduced by 332 million boe primarily due to price and pricerelated revisions and the sale of williston occidental incurred approximately 13 billion in 2015  to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves a substantial portion of the proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 2015  was the result of the development program in the permian basin which represents 68 percent of total yearend proved undeveloped reserves 

global oversupply continues to suppress oil and gas prices significantly these conditions may continue for an extended period prolonged or further declines in commodity prices could require occidental to further reduce capital spending potentially impacting either the quantity or the development timing of proved undeveloped reserves 

reserves evaluation and review process 

occidentals estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of december 31 2015  were made by occidental’s technical personnel and are 

  

the responsibility of management the estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by occidental to develop the reserves this process involves reservoir engineers geoscientists planning engineers and financial analysts as part of the proved reserves estimation process all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates operating costs and capital expenditures price differentials between benchmark prices the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods including estimates from decline curve analysis typecurve analysis material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance these fieldtested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities 

net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 

the current senior vice president reserves for oxy oil and gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates in compliance with us securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations including the internal audit and review of occidentals oil and gas reserves data the senior vice president has over 30 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business and has held various assignments in north america asia and europe he is a threetime past chair of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee he is an american association of petroleum geologists aapg certified petroleum geologist and currently serves on the aapg committee on resource evaluation he is a member of the society of petroleum evaluation engineers the colorado school of mines potential gas committee and the unece expert group on resource classification he is also an active member of the joint committee on reserves evaluator training jcoret the senior vice president has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in geology from emory university in atlanta 

occidental has a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee consisting of senior corporate officers to review and approve occidentals oil and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidentals board of directors during the year since 2003 occidental has retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum 

 

engineering consultants to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes 

in 2015  ryder scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of december 31 2015  in accordance with the sec regulatory standards ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of occidental’s 2015  yearend total proved reserves portfolio in 2015  ryder scott reviewed approximately 19 percent of occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves since being engaged in 2003 ryder scott has reviewed the specific application of occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 80 percent of occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves management retains ryder scott to provide objective thirdparty input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by occidental occidental has filed ryder scotts independent report as an exhibit to this form 10k 

based on its reviews including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current sec regulations 

industry outlook 

the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions the wti and brent oil price indexes declined further in 2015  closing at 3704 per barrel and 3728 per barrel respectively as of december 31 2015  commodity prices continued their decline in early 2016 the wti and brent oil price indexes were 5327 per barrel and 5733 per barrel respectively as of december 31 2014  

oil prices will continue to be affected by i global supply and demand which are generally a function of global economic conditions inventory levels production disruptions technological advances regional market conditions and the actions of opec other significant producers and governments ii transportation capacity infrastructure constraints and cost in producing areas iii currency exchange rates and iv the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions 

ngls prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock in addition infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region 

  

domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas 

these and other factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil ngls and domestic gas prices reliably international gas prices are generally fixed under longterm contracts occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital 

chemical segment 

business environment 

despite the continued modest pace of united states economic growth demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks decreased slightly as the global economic slowdown broadened and the strength of the us dollar hindered exports vinyls margins improved during the second half of 2015 as the cost of feedstocks primarily ethylene and natural gas improved significantly from 2014 levels 

business review 

basic chemicals 

during 2015 the united states economy continued its slow recovery with fullyear growth expected to be below the 24 percent growth rate experienced in 2014 the lower us growth rate was reflected in lower domestic demand as the industry chlorine operating rate decreased 1 percent to 83 percent from 84 percent in 2014 the slightly lower operating rate resulted in only a moderate improvement in chlorine pricing exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain were competitive for the balance of the year as ethylene costs decreased in line with falling energy costs however total derivative export volume was down versus 2014 as global demand softened particularly in asia and latin america liquid caustic soda prices experienced downward price pressure during the first three quarters of 2015 as the industry continued to absorb the additional chloralkali capacity that has come on line in the us during the last 2 years domestic caustic soda prices rose in the fourth quarter of 2015 as the industry pushed to expand margins from historically depressed levels export demand and pricing remains under pressure due to global over capacity and lower growth in major consuming regions and the strength of the us dollar impacted demand for us products businesses such as calcium chloride and especially muriatic acid were down due to substantially reduced oil and gas drilling activity and demand 

vinyls 

industry pvc margins improved slightly in 2015 compared to 2014 as record high spot ethylene costs declined sharply throughout the year and offset declines in pvc pricing yearoveryear domestic pvc demand increased only 09 percent due to the slow start to 2015 housing construction following extended winter conditions as well as the slower pace of growth in single family home sales as the world economy stalled export demand 

 

decreased 25 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 the pvc industry operating rate in 2015 of 837 percent was 06 percent lower than 2014 largely due to increased industry capacity coming online export volume remained a significant portion of pvc sales representing 30 percent of total north american producer’s production the us ethylene cost advantage of prior years has been reduced as world oil prices continued to decline in 2015 in early 2014 oxychem through a 5050 joint venture with mexichem sab de cv broke ground on a 12 billion poundperyear ethylene cracker at the oxychem ingleside facility construction on the ethylene cracker remains on budget and on schedule and the facility is expected to begin operating in early 2017 

industry outlook 

industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy specifically in the housing construction automotive and durable goods markets margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices longterm weakness in the petroleum industry may negatively affect the demand and pricing of a number of occidental’s products that are consumed by industry participants 

basic chemicals 

occidental expects that if the united states housing automotive and durable goods markets continue to improve domestic demand for basic chemical products should be moderately higher in 2016 overall the low chloralkali operating rates driven by capacity increases may limit significant price improvement but expected demand coupled with low energy costs should allow the margin gains secured at the end of 2015 to remain in place the continued competitiveness of downstream chlorine derivatives in global markets is contingent on united states feedstock costs primarily natural gas and ethylene remaining favorable compared to other feedstock costs in global markets 

vinyls 

north american demand and operating rates should improve in 2016 as growth in both housing starts and commercial construction continues occidental expects us export demand to improve modestly and for margins to be on par with 2015 

midstream and marketing segment 

business environment 

midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing and trading businesses and its processing transportation and power generation assets marketing and trading performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segments plants and pipelines as well as the margins obtained on related services 

  

business review 

pipeline transportation 

margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped dolphin energy owns and operates a 230milelong 48inchdiameter natural gas pipeline dolphin pipeline which transports dry natural gas from qatar to the uae and oman the dolphin pipeline has capacity to transport up to 32 bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 23 bcf per day 

occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2900 miles of pipelines from southeast new mexico across the permian basin of southwest texas to cushing oklahoma the system has a current throughput capacity of about 720000 barrels per day 70 million barrels of active storage capability and 127 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline 

occidentals 2015  pipeline transportation earnings declined from 2014  primarily due to lower income from its investment in plains pipeline as a result of occidentals november 2014 sale of a portion of its plains pipeline interest 

gas processing plants and co 2  fields and facilities 

occidental processes its and thirdparty domestic wet gas to extract ngls and other gas byproducts including co 2  and delivers dry gas to pipelines margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for ngls 

occidental together with adnoc completed the al hosn gas processing facilities in abu dhabi at the end of 2014 and became fully operational in 2015 the al hosn gas processing facilities are designed to process 10 bcf per day of natural gas and separate it into sales gas condensate ngls and sulfur the al hosn gas processing facilities include facilities to extract sulfur from natural gas and process it for sale the facility produces approximately 8700 tons per day of sulfur of which occidentals share is approximately 3500 tons of sulfur per day 

 

occidental relies upon several sources to ensure an adequate supply of co 2  for its permian eor operations including the occidental operated bravo dome field in northeastern new mexico and additional supplies from methane fields in the southwestern permian basin occidental’s century plant in pecos county texas further expands its eor infrastructure in the permian basin the plant processes natural gas with high co 2  content resulting in methane gas for the market as well as a major source of co 2  for our permian operations 

occidental’s 2015  earnings from these operations decreased compared to 2014  due to lower realized ngl prices partially offset by the commencement of al hosn sulfur sales 

power generation facilities 

earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties the decrease in earnings in 2015  compared to 2014  was due to lower margins in lower spark spreads and decreased production resulting from increased planned outages 

marketing 

the marketing group markets substantially all of occidental’s oil ngls and gas production and trades around its assets including its transportation and storage capacity occidental’s thirdparty marketing and trading activities focus on purchasing oil ngls and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets these purchases allow occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets marketing performance in 2015  declined compared to 2014  due to the narrowing of the midland to gulf coast oil price differentials 

industry outlook 

the pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable the gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending mostly on ngls prices which cannot reasonably be predicted generally higher ngls prices result in higher profitability the marketing business in isolation can be volatile in periods of severe price swings occidental continues to actively focus on marketing its commodity production to generate maximum value for its stakeholders 

  

segment results of operations and significant items affecting earnings 

segment earnings exclude income taxes interest income interest expense environmental remediation expenses unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments equity investments seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in occidentals consolidated quarterly earnings during the year 

the statements of income and cash flows and supplemental oil and gas information related to california resources have been treated as discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 the assets and liabilities of california resources were removed from occidentals consolidated balance sheet as of november 30 2014 because of the spinoff from occidental 

the following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items 



see footnotes following significant transactions and events affecting occidentals earnings 

 

the following table sets forth significant transactions and events affecting occidental’s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature timing and amount 





  

oil and gas 



the following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil ngls and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2015  the differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at occidental’s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers 



 



  





 

oil and gas segment results in 2015  included pretax impairment and related charges of 35 billion and 50 billion on domestic and international assets respectively approximately 13 billion of the domestic impairment and related charges were due to the exit of occidental’s operations in the williston basin which was sold in november 2015 and in the piceance basin where assets and associated liabilities have been classified as held for sale at december 31 2015 the remaining domestic charges were due to the significant decline in the futures price curve as well as management’s decision not to pursue 

 

development activities associated with certain nonproducing acreage internationally the impairments and related charges were due to a combination of occidental’s strategic plan to exit or reduce our exposure in certain middle east and north africa operations as well as the decline in the futures price curve which have made certain projects in the region unprofitable earnings in 2014  included pretax charges of 53 billion related to the impairment of domestic and international assets and the gain from the sale of hugoton assets earnings in 2013 included pretax charges of 06 billion for the impairment of domestic nonproducing acreage 

domestic oil and gas segment results excluding impairment and other charges in both years reflected a loss of approximately 700 million in 2015 compared to income of 19 billion in 2014 the decrease in domestic earnings reflected significantly lower crude oil ngl and natural gas prices partially offset by higher crude oil production volumes and lower operating costs from lower workover and maintenance costs and lower dda expenses international oil and gas segment earnings excluding impairments and other charges were 12 billion in 2015 and 40 billion in 2014 the decrease in international earnings reflected lower realized crude oil prices partially offset by higher sales volumes 

average production costs for 2015 excluding taxes other than on income were 1157 per boe compared to 1350 per boe for 2014 the decrease in average costs reflected decreased activity in downhole maintenance and lower overall cost structure 

average daily oil and gas production volumes excluding assets sold increased by 81000 boe to 652000 boe in 2015 average domestic daily production increased by 20000 boe to 312000 boe in 2015 during this same time period domestic daily oil production increased by over 15 percent or 25000 barrels per day to 187000 barrels all coming from permian resources an increase in permian resources production was partially offset by lower natural gas and oil production in piceance and south texas where we have ceased all gas drilling activities international average daily production volumes increased to 340000 boe in 2015 from 279000 boe in 2014 the increase was primarily due to the start up of production from al hosn and higher production in colombia total company average daily sales volumes were 658000 boe per day in 2015 and 572000 boe per day in 2014 

domestic oil and gas segment earnings excluding impairment and other charges in both years were 19 billion in 2014 compared to 25 billion in 2013 the decrease in domestic earnings reflected lower crude oil and ngls prices higher operating costs from increased workover and maintenance activities and higher dda expenses partially offset by higher crude oil production volumes and improved realized prices for natural gas international oil and gas segment earnings excluding impairments were 40 billion in 2014 and 46 billion in 2013 international earnings reflected lower realized crude oil prices and sales volumes partially offset by lower operating expenses and dda 

  

average daily oil and gas production volumes excluding assets sold were 571000 boe and 573000 boe in 2014 and 2013 respectively average domestic daily production volumes were 292000 boe in 2014 and 285000 boe in 2013 during this same time period domestic daily oil production increased by 6 percent or 9000 barrels per day to 162000 barrels mainly coming from permian resources international average daily production volumes decreased to 279000 boe in 2014 from 289000 boe in 2013 the decrease was primarily due to lower cost recovery barrels in iraq and insurgent activities in colombia libya and yemen total company average daily sales volumes were 572000 boe in both 2014 and 2013 

chemical 



chemical segment earnings excluding asset impairments of 121 million and gain on sale of 98 million from the sale of an idled facility were 565 million in 2015 compared to 569 million excluding asset impairments of 149 million in 2014 the year over year decrease was primarily due to lower caustic soda pricing and lower sales volumes across most products offset by improved pvc margins resulting primarily from lower energy and ethylene costs 

chemical segment earnings excluding asset impairments of 149 million in 2014 and gain on sale of 131 million from the sale of the carbocloro investment in 2013 were 569 million in 2014 compared to 612 million in 2013 the lower earnings in 2014 were primarily a result of lower caustic soda pricing driven by new chloralkali capacity in the industry and higher energy and ethylene costs partially offset by higher pvc margins and improved volumes across most product lines 

midstream and marketing 



midstream and marketing segment earnings were 65 million in 2015 compared to 549 million in 2014 excluding impairments and related item charges of 13 billion mainly consisting of the impairment charge of the century gas processing plant in 2015 and 20 billion of gains comprised of the sale of bridgetex pipeline and part of occidentals investment in plains pipeline in 2014 the decrease in earnings primarily reflected lower marketing margins due to the narrowing of the midland to gulf coast differentials lower domestic gas processing income due to lower ngl prices and lower pipeline income as a result of lower dolphin pipeline gas sales and the decrease in occidentals interest in plains pipeline 

 

midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2014 excluding impairments and other items and gains on sales of 20 billion in 2014 and 10 billion in 2013 were 549 million in 2014 compared to 537 million in 2013 the increase in earnings reflected higher income from the gas processing and power generation businesses partially offset by lower marketing performance and pipeline income 

taxes 

deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets of 20 billion were 13 billion at december 31 2015  the deferred tax assets net of allowances are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences 

worldwide effective tax rate 

the following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations 



 

occidentals 2015  worldwide effective tax rate was 14 percent which is lower than in 2014  mainly due to the mix of domestic operating losses and foreign operating income domestic asset impairments that are taxed at statutory rates and foreign oil and gas asset impairments the majority of which have no reported tax benefits excluding the impact of impairments and other nonrecurring items occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate for 2015 would be 86 percent 

a deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries as it is occidental’s intention generally to reinvest such earnings permanently if the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested an additional deferred tax liability of approximately 115 million would be required assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits 

  

consolidated results of operations 

changes in components of occidentals results of continuing operations are discussed below 

revenue and other income items 



the decrease in net sales in 2015  compared to 2014  was mainly due to the significant decline in worldwide oil ngls and gas prices partially offset by higher domestic and international crude oil volumes average wti and brent prices fell by nearly 50 percent and nymex gas prices fell by over 35 percent in 2015 as compared to 2014 prices 

the decrease in net sales in 2014  compared to 2013  was due to a significant decline in the fourth quarter of 2014  in worldwide oil and ngls prices partially offset by higher domestic oil volumes and higher domestic natural gas prices 

price and volume changes in the oil and gas segment generally represent the majority of the change in oil and gas segment income which is a substantially larger portion of the overall change in net income than the chemical and midstream and marketing segments 

the 2015  gains on sale included 98 million for the sale of an idled facility the 2014  gains on sale included 14 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in plains pipeline 633 million for the sale of bridgetex pipeline and 531 million for the sale of hugoton properties the 2013  gains on sale included 10 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in plains pipeline and 131 million for the sale of the carbocloro investment 

expense items 



cost of sales decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment lower fuel costs in the power generation operations and lower worldwide production costs including workovers and downhole maintenance costs 

cost of sales increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment and increased domestic down hole maintenance activities and higher costs for purchased injectants in the oil and gas segment 

 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower compensation expense 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses in 2014 were approximately equivalent to 2013 

dda increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to higher production volumes partially offset by lower dda rates 

asset impairments and related items in 2015 of 102 billion included charges of 35 billion related to domestic oil and gas assets due to occidental’s exit from the williston and piceance basins as well as the decline in the futures price curve and management’s decision not to pursue activities associated with certain nonproducing acreage international oil and gas charges of 50 billion were due to a combination of occidental’s strategic plan to exit or reduce its exposure in certain middle east and north africa operations as well as the decline in the futures price curve which have made certain projects in the region unprofitable midstream charges of 13 billion included the impairment of occidental’s century gas processing plant as a result of sandridge’s inability to provide volumes to the plant and meet their contractual obligations to deliver co 2  occidental recorded an otherthantemporary loss of 227 million for its available for sale investment in california resources 

asset impairments and related items in 2014 of 74 billion included 28 billion in the williston basin 904 million related to occidentals gas and ngls assets 889 million for other domestic acreage and 11 billion primarily related to operations in bahrain and other international operations asset impairments also include charges for joslyn oil sands of 805 million and an other than temporary loss of 553 million for the available for sale investment in california resources stock 

asset impairments and related items in 2013 of 621 million were mostly related to the impairment of certain nonproducing domestic oil and gas acreage 

taxes other than on income in 2015 decreased from 2014 due primarily to lower oil ngl and gas prices which resulted in lower ad valorem and severance taxes taxes other than on income in 2014 were approximately equivalent to 2013 

other items 



provision for income taxes decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the pretax loss in 2015 as a result of the lower price environment and impairments and related charges 

provision for income taxes decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower pretax income partially offset by certain nondeductible charges which increased the effective rate 

income from equity investments decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower earnings from occidentals 

  

equity investments in pipelines as a result of the lower dolphin gas sales occidentals reduced ownership in plains pipeline and the expiration of occidentals contract in yemen block 10 where occidental held an equity interest occidental’s reduced ownership in the plains pipeline contributed to the decrease of income from equity investments from 2013 to 2014 

discontinued operations net in 2015 of 317 million includes the initial settlement payments by the republic of ecuador see note 2 of the consolidated financial statements 

consolidated analysis of financial position 

the changes in select components of occidental’s balance sheet are discussed below 



assets 

see liquidity and capital resources — cash flow analysis for discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 

the decline in trade receivables net was due to lower oil and gas prices at the end of 2015 compared to the end of 2014 inventories decreased as a result of lower per unit values assigned to oil and gas inventories other current assets increased as a result of receivables recorded for the federal and state tax refunds anticipated on the net operating loss carryback the increase in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to 2015 contributions to the ethylene cracker joint venture partially offset by a financing distribution from dolphin energy the decrease in the available for sale investment is the result of an other than temporary impairment recognized with respect to the value of occidentals retained interest in california resources in february 2016 occidental declared a special stock dividend for all of its 715 million shares of common stock of california resources to stockholders of 

 

record as of february 29 2016 to be distributed on march 24 2016 the decrease in ppe net was due to dda and asset impairments partially offset by capital expenditures 

liabilities and stockholders equity 

current maturities of longterm debt was related to occidentals 4125percent and 25percent senior notes due in 2016 the decrease in accounts payable reflected lower marketing payables as a result of lower oil and gas prices at the end of 2015 and lower accrued capital expenditures as occidental reduced its capital budget liabilities of assets held for sale represented liabilities to be transferred with the piceance field 

the decrease in deferred credits and other liabilitiesincome taxes was due to the decrease in the difference between the book and tax basis of occidentals oil and gas properties the increase in deferred credits and other liabilities was primarily due to contractual obligations related to assets held for sale the decrease in stockholders equity reflected the distribution of cash dividends share repurchases and the 2015 net loss 

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2015  occidental had approximately 32 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and 12 billion  in restricted cash a substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the united states income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segments prices sales volumes and costs 

as a result of the taxfree status of the spinoff of california resources occidentals use of restricted cash is limited to the payment of dividends repayment of debt or share repurchases to retain the taxfree status of the spinoff the restricted cash must be used for one of these purposes within eighteen months from the date of distribution subsequent to december 31 2015 occidental utilized the remaining restricted cash balance to retire debt and pay dividends 

in june 2015 occidental issued 15 billion of debt that was comprised of 750 million of 350percent senior unsecured notes due 2025 and 750 million of 4625percent senior unsecured notes due 2045 occidental received net proceeds of approximately 148 billion interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears in june and december of each year for both series of notes beginning on december 15 2015 in february 2016 occidental retired 700 million of 25percent senior notes that had matured 

in august 2014 occidental entered into a new fiveyear 20 billion bank credit facility credit facility in order to replace its previous 20 billion bank credit facility which was scheduled to expire in october 2016 the 2014 credit facility does not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict occidentals ability to borrow under this facility occidental did not draw down any amounts under the credit facility during 2015  and no amounts were outstanding as of december 31 2015  

as of december 31 2015  under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings 

  

the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on or acquisitions of occidental stock 

occidental from time to time may access and has accessed debt markets for general corporate purposes including acquisitions 

cash flow analysis 



cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2015 decreased 56 billion to 33 billion from 89 billion in 2014 operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower worldwide realized oil ngls and natural gas prices throughout 2015 which on a yearoveryear basis declined 48 percent 57 percent and 42 percent respectively the effect of lower commodity prices was partially offset by higher production and lower operating costs the usage of working capital in 2015 reflected lower realized prices that impacted receivable collections and payments related to higher capital and operating spending accrued in the fourth quarter of 2014 and paid in 2015 

cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased 13 billion in 2014 to 89 billion compared to 102 billion in 2013 operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower oil prices in the second half of 2014 which on a yearoveryear basis declined 8 percent domestically and 9 percent worldwide and higher domestic operating expenses for increased workover activity and higher prices for purchased injectants also in 2014 occidental paid higher income taxes in part related to the fourth quarter 2013 sale of a portion of the investment in plains pipeline and the first half of 2014 sale of hugoton assets while 2013 included the collection of a tax receivable working capital changes in receivables reflected higher collections in the first half of 2014 

other cost elements such as labor costs and overhead are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flows than changes in oil and gas product prices sales volumes and operating costs 

the chemical and midstream and marketing segments cash flows are significantly smaller and their overall cash flows are generally less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment 

occidental booked significant noncash adjustments to income as a result of lower product prices and management’s strategic review asset impairments and related items were 97 billion  74 billion and 06 billion for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the 2015 and 2014 impairments are the result of a thorough portfolio review which resulted in the reduction of carrying values for projects which have subpar returns in the current low oil 

 

and gas price environment the 2013 impairment was mostly related to nonproducing domestic oil and gas acreage 

occidental recorded gains on sale of equity investments and other assets of 01 billion  25 billion and 12 billion in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively cash proceeds related to these gains are reported as investing activities 

in 2015 occidental filed for an extension of time for payment of taxes by a corporation expecting a net operating loss carryback the other operating net for 2015 of 650 million represented the federal and state tax benefit on the carryback of the 2015 net operating loss of which 358 million will be applied to the 2014 federal balance due and the remainder will be received in cash during 2016 the 382 million in 2013 reflected the collection of a tax refund related to the 2012 net operating loss carryback 



occidentals net capital expenditures declined 31 billion in 2015 to 56 billion after contributions to the oxychem ingleside facility which is included in other investing activities the decline is the result of lower spending in oil and gas noncore operations in the united states and middle east and reduced expenditures on longterm projects coming on line at the end of 2014 

compared to 72 billion in 2013 occidentals net capital expenditures for 2014 were 87 billion after netting of partner contributions for the bridgetex pipeline which is included in financing activities and the chemical joint venture the increase in capital expenditures of 15 billion from 2013 to 2014 was due to increased development activity in the domestic oil and gas operations primarily permian resources the increase in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was due to higher spending for the al hosn gas project and bridgetex pipeline 

while the 2016 environment remains challenging occidental remains committed to allocating capital to only its highest return projects occidentals 2016 capital spending is expected to be no more than 3 billion 

in 2015 cash flows used in other investing activities of 01 billion is comprised primarily of changes in the capital accrual and asset purchases offset by the sales of equity investments and assets 

the 2014 other investing activities net included proceeds of 13 billion for the sale of the hugoton field operations 11 billion for the sale of the bridgetex 

  

pipeline and 17 billion for the sale of a portion of occidental’s investment in plains pipeline which was partially offset by 17 billion of acquisitions primarily in the permian basin 

the 2013 other investing activities net included proceeds of 14 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in plains pipeline and 03 billion for the sale of chemical’s investment in carbocloro which was partially offset by acquisitions of approximately 06 billion 

capital commitments for longterm projects currently under construction in the midstream and chemicals segment in 2016 are planned to be approximately 500 million 



cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was 15 billion as compared to cash used by financing activities in 2014 of 22 billion financing activities in 2015 included proceeds from long term debt of 15 billion occidental used restricted cash of 28 billion to pay dividends and purchase treasury stock subsequent to december 31 2015 occidental utilized the remaining restricted cash balance to retire debt and pay dividends 

cash used by financing activities in 2014 included special cash distributions received prior to the separation of california resources of 61 billion of which 495 billion was restricted cash approximately 09 billion of the restricted cash was used for share repurchases and the fourth quarter dividend payment resulting in a 40 billion restricted cash balance as of december 31 2014 the 2014 net cash used by financing activities included 25 billion for purchases of treasury stock and 22 billion for dividend payments which were partially offset by 04 billion for contributions received from a noncontrolling interest a dividend payment was accelerated in 2012 which resulted in three dividend payments in 2013 whereas there were four cash dividend payments in 2014 

the 2013 net cash used by financing activities included 07 billion used to retire debt and 02 billion of contributions received from a noncontrolling interest common stock dividends paid and purchases of treasury stock were 16 billion and 09 billion in 2013 respectively due to the accelerated payment in 2012 of that years fourth quarter dividend in addition purchases of treasury stock increased from 06 billion in 2012 to over 09 billion in 2013 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of occidentals offbalancesheet arrangements 

guarantees 

occidental has guaranteed its portion of equity method investees debt and has entered into various other 

 

guarantees including performance bonds letters of credit indemnities and commitments provided by occidental to third parties mainly to provide assurance that opc or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees as of december 31 2015  occidental’s guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately 318 million of dolphin’s debt the fair value of the guarantees was immaterial 

occidental has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries for various letters of credit indemnities and commitments 

see oil and gas segment — business review — qatar and “segment results of operations” for further information about dolphin 

leases 

occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements mainly for transportation equipment power plants machinery terminals storage facilities land and office space occidental leases assets when leasing offers greater operating flexibility lease payments are generally expensed as part of cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses for more information see contractual obligations 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes and crossreferences occidental’s contractual obligations this summary indicates on and offbalancesheet obligations as of december 31 2015  





  

delivery commitments 

occidental has made commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil natural gas and ngls the total amount contracted to be delivered a substantial majority of which is in the united states is approximately 379 million barrels of oil through 2025 7 billion cubic feet of gas through 2016 and 22 million barrels of ngls through 2017 the price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall 

lawsuits claims and contingencies 

opc or certain of its subsidiaries are involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property damage or other losses punitive damages civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief opc or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar federal state local and foreign environmental laws these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties and injunctive relief usually opc or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies further some lawsuits claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction 

in december 2014 a new jersey state court approved occidental’s settlement with the state of new jersey the state to resolve claims asserted by the state against occidental arising from occidental’s acquisition of diamond shamrock chemicals company dscc during 2015 pursuant to the settlement agreement state settlement occidental paid the state 190 million under certain circumstances occidental agreed to perform or fund future work on behalf of the state along a portion of the passaic river when occidental acquired the stock of dscc in 1986 maxus energy corporation a subsidiary of ypf sa maxus retained liability for the lister avenue plant which is part of the diamond alkali superfund site as well as other sites maxus is also obligated to indemnify occidental for the state settlement occidental is pursuing maxus to recover the settlement costs the state settlement does not cover any potential occidental share of costs associated with the epa’s proposed cleanup plan of the passaic river announced in april 2014 maxus is also responsible for federal cleanup or other costs associated with the lister avenue plant and the diamond alkali superfund site 

occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters reserve balances for other matters as of december 31 2015  and 2014  were not 

 

material to occidentals consolidated balance sheets occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations environmental matters are further discussed under the caption environmental liabilities and expenditures below 

during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax jurisdictions although taxable years through 2009 for united states federal income tax purposes have been audited by the united states internal revenue service irs pursuant to its compliance assurance program subsequent taxable years are currently under review additionally in december 2012 occidental filed united states federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 which are subject to irs review taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions in certain of these jurisdictions tax authorities are in various stages of auditing occidental’s income taxes during the course of tax audits disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

opc its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2015  occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality occidental’s environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in the future occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand 

environmental remediation 

the laws that require or address environmental remediation including cercla and similar federal state local and foreign laws may apply retroactively and regardless of fault the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites opc or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings 

  

under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating closed and thirdparty sites remedial activities may include one or more of the following investigation involving sampling modeling risk assessment or monitoring cleanup measures including removal treatment or disposal or operation and maintenance of remedial systems the environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties injunctive relief and government oversight costs 

as of december 31 2015  occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 149 sites the following table presents occidental’s environmental remediation reserves as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the us environmental protection agency on the cercla national priorities list npl sites and three categories of nonnpl sites — thirdparty sites occidentaloperated sites and closed or nonoperated occidental sites 



as of december 31 2015  occidental’s environmental reserves exceeded 10 million each at 13 of the 149 sites described above and 101 of the sites had reserves from 0 to 1 million each 

as of december 31 2015  two sites — a landfill in western new york owned by occidental and a remediation site in texas — accounted for 62 percent of its reserves associated with npl sites in connection with the 1986 acquisition of dscc stock maxus energy corporation has retained the liability and is indemnifying occidental for 14 of the remaining npl sites 

as of december 31 2015  maxus has also retained the liability and is indemnifying occidental for 8 of the 66 thirdparty sites four of the remaining 58 thirdparty sites — a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee an active plant outside of the united states and an active refinery in louisiana where occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities — accounted for 50 percent of occidental’s reserves associated with these sites 

four sites — chemical plants in kansas louisiana texas and new york — accounted for 59 percent of the reserves associated with the occidentaloperated sites 

 

five other sites — a landfill in western new york former chemical plants in tennessee delaware and washington and a closed coal mine in pennsylvania — accounted for 70 percent of the reserves associated with closed or nonoperated occidental sites 

environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation the following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years 



based on current estimates occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four  years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10  or more years occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to 370 million see critical accounting policies and estimates — environmental liabilities and expenditures for additional information 

environmental costs 

occidental’s environmental costs some of which include estimates are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended december 31 



operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures relate to longerlived improvements in properties currently operated by occidental remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations 

occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately 116 million for 2016  

  

foreign investments 

many of occidental’s assets are located outside north america at december 31 2015  the carrying value of occidental’s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately 98 billion or 23 percent of occidental’s total assets at that date of such assets approximately 83 billion are located in middle eastnorth africa and approximately 13 billion are located in latin america for the year ended december 31 2015  net sales outside north america totaled 49 billion or approximately 40 percent of total net sales 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires occidentals management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts there has been no material change to occidentals critical accounting policies over the past three years the selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve managements judgment 

oil and gas properties 

the carrying value of occidental’s ppe represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest net of accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization dda and any impairment charges for assets acquired ppe cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets 

occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found if proved reserves have been found the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized otherwise occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense in some cases a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12month period after drilling is complete 

occidental expenses annual lease rentals the costs of injectants used in production and geological geophysical and seismic costs as incurred 

occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unitofproduction method it amortizes acquisition costs over total proved 

 

reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 

several factors could change occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves for example occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices in other cases particularly with longlived properties lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical for such properties higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded in 2015  negative revisions of previous estimates of 315 million boe were primarily price and pricerelated associated with domestic assets 

additionally occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable if there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices significant changes in reserve estimates changes in managements plans or other significant events management will evaluate the property for impairment under the successful efforts method if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows which is generally on a field by field basis the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants the impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time these assumptions include estimates of future product prices contractual prices 

  

estimates of riskadjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs it is reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in other additional impairments 

the most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in occidentals oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the dda rate for example a 5 percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the dda rate by approximately 065 per barrel which would increase or decrease pretax income by approximately 155 million annually at current production rates the change in the dda rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial 

a portion of the carrying value of occidental’s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were 03 billion and 20 billion at december 31 2015  and 2014 respectively the unproved amounts are not subject to dda until they are classified as proved properties capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to dda when proved reserves are assigned to the property if the exploration efforts are unsuccessful or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices higher development and operating costs contractual conditions or other factors the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed the timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties if warranted depends upon managements plans the nature timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance 

chemical assets 

occ identals chemical assets are depreciated using either the unitofproduction or the straightline method based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets which range from three years to 50 years are also used for impairment tests the estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance as well as planned major maintenance activities pmma ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred pmma costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul additionally occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use these capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service the resulting revision if any of the asset’s 

 

estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively 

without these continued expenditures the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition demand feedstock costs energy prices environmental regulations and technological changes 

occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

occidentals net ppe for the chemical segment is approximately 24 billion and its depreciation expense for 2016  is expected to be approximately 300 million the most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical plants would be on depreciation expense for example a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pretax earnin gs by approximately 50 million per year 

midstream marketing and other assets 

derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cashflow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment otherwise any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period for cashflow hedges the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income oci with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged realized gains or losses from cashflow hedges and any ineffective portion are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location quality grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of operations there were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended december 31 2015  2014 and 2013 

a hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if at inception and throughout its life it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows respectively of the hedging instrument in the case of hedging a forecast transaction the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly 

  

effective as a hedge when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable 

occidentals midstream and marketing ppe is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using either the unitofproduction or straightline method occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

fair value measurements 

occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a threelevel fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation techniques level 1 – using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities level 2 – using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities and level 3 – using unobservable inputs transfers between levels if any are recognized at the end of each reporting period 

fair values  recurring 

occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs occidental utilizes the midpoint between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value in addition to using market data occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique for assets and liabilities carried at fair value occidental measures fair value using the following methods 

 Ø overthecounter otc bilateral financial commodity contracts foreign exchange contracts options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industrystandard models that consider various inputs including quoted forward prices for commodities time value volatility factors credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments as well as other relevant economic measures substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 



 

are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as level 3 within the valuation hierarchy 

occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a marketobservable price for an identical or similar asset or liability this approach utilizes managements judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows and discounts those cash flows using a riskadjusted discount rate 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience remedial objectives available technologies applicable laws and regulations and costsharing arrangements occidental bases environmental reserves on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred using the most costeffective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established the reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established the amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received or when receipt of recovery is highly probable occidental had accruals to income for highly probable reimbursements or recoveries of 13 million in 2015 and no accruals in 2014 and 2013 

many factors could affect occidental’s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses the most significant are 1 cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate 2 the length of time type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination 3 a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify occidental’s proposed remedial plan 4 improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs 5 laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability and 6 changes in allocation or costsharing arrangements may occur 

certain sites involve multiple parties with various costsharing arrangements which fall into the following three categories 1 environmental proceedings that result in a 

  

negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties 2 oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest or 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of properties in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs in these circumstances occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate when estimating occidentals ultimate share of liability occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and based on these factors believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved 

in addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures which often take in excess of 10 years at npl sites occidentals reserves include managements estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly 

if occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings for example if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent occidental would record a pretax gain of 39 million if the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 39 million 

other loss contingencies 

occidental is involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings and audits occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis 

loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate management’s judgments could change based on new information changes in or interpretations of laws or regulations changes in management’s plans or intentions opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings or other factors see lawsuits claims and contingencies for additional information

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

general 

occidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil ngls and natural gas prices price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect occidental’s pretax annual income by approximately 120 million for a 1 per barrel change in oil prices and 30 million for a 1 per barrel change in ngls prices if domestic natural gas prices varied by 050 per mcf it would have an estimated annual effect on occidentals pretax income of approximately 45 million these pricechange sensitivities include the impact of psc and similar contract volume changes on income if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidental’s results to prices also will change the marketing and trading results are sensitive to price changes of oil natural gas and to a lesser degree other commodities these sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing and trading volumes and cannot be predicted reliably 

occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices a variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of 10 per ton would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 10 million and 30 million respectively a variation in pvc prices of 001  per lb would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 25 million historically over time product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins according to ihs chemical 2015  average contract prices were chlorine—265 per ton caustic soda—580 per ton and pvc—064 per lb 

occidental uses derivative instruments including a combination of shortterm futures forwards options and swaps to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas occidental only occasionally hedges its oil and gas production and when it does so the volumes are usually insignificant 

risk management 

occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy the controls under this policy are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which manages risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check members of the risk management group report to the corporate vice president and treasurer controls for these activities include limits on value at risk limits on credit limits on total notional trade value segregation of duties delegation of authority daily price verifications daily reporting to senior management of positions together with various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls additionally these operations maintain highly liquid positions as a result of which the market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice 

 

fair value of marketing and trading derivative contracts 

occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing and trading activities at fair value fair values for these contracts are derived principally from level 1 and level 2 sources 

the following table shows the fair value of occidentals derivatives excluding collateral segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation 



note  includes cashflow hedges further discussed below 

cashflow hedges 

occidental’s marketing and trading operations from time to time store natural gas purchased from third parties at occidental’s north american leased storage facilities at december 31 2015 occidental had approximately 13 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage and had cashflow hedges for the forecast sale to be settled by physical delivery of approximately 14 billion cubic feet of stored natural gas as of december 31 2014 occidental did not have any cashflow hedges on stored volumes of natural gas 

quantitative information 

occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commoditybased and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities this method determines the maximum potential negative shortterm change in fair value with at least a 95 percent level of confidence additionally occidental uses trading limits including among others limits on total notional trade value and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice as a result of these controls occidental has determined that the market risk of the marketing and trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its operations 

interest rate risk 

general 

occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variablerate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2015  variablerate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of occidentals total debt 

  

tabular presentation of interest rate risk 

the table below provides information about occidentals debt obligations debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date 



 

credit risk 

the majority of occidentals counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong by entering into master netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral as appropriate occidental actively reviews the creditworthiness of its counterparties and monitors credit exposures against assigned credit limits by adjusting credit limits to reflect counterparty risk if necessary occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions 

 

settle on a daily margin basis 

certain of occidentals otc derivative instruments contain creditriskcontingent features primarily tied to credit ratings for occidental or its counterparties which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post occidental believes that if it had received a onenotch reduction in its credit ratings it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateralposting requirements as of december 31 2015  and 2014  

as of december 31 2015  the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties occidental believes its exposure to creditrelated losses at december 31 2015  was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented 

foreign currency risk 

occidental’s foreign operations have limited currency risk occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes a vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in united states dollars additionally all of occidental’s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the united states dollar as the functional currency as of december 31 2015  the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the trading operations was immaterial the effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income

controls and procedures 

tableend managements annual assessment of and report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

the management of occidental petroleum corporation and its subsidiaries occidental is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting occidental’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles occidental’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of occidental’s assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that occidental’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of occidental’s management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of occidental’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management has assessed the effectiveness of occidental’s internal control system as of december 31 2015  based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework issued in 2013 by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management believes that as of december 31 2015  occidental’s system of internal control over financial reporting is effective 

occidental’s independent auditors kpmg llp have issued an audit report on occidental’s internal control over financial reporting 

disclosure controls and procedures 

occidentals chief executive officer and its senior vice president and chief financial officer supervised and participated in occidentals evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation occidentals chief executive officer and senior vice president and chief financial officer concluded that occidentals disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2015  

there has been no change in occidentals internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act during the fourth quarter of 2015  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect occidentals internal control over financial reporting the report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting is set forth in item 8

 information contained on occidentals website is not part of this report 




 item 1a risk factors 

volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidentals financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products particularly oil and to a lesser extent natural gas and ngls and its chemical products 

prices for crude oil natural gas and ngls fluctuate widely historically the markets for crude oil natural gas ngls and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future prolonged or further declines in crude oil natural gas and ngls prices would reduce occidentals operating results and cash flows and could impact its future rate of growth and further impact the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets 

prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in occidentals control these factors include among others 



 

 the longterm effects of these and other conditions on the prices of crude oil natural gas ngls and refined products are uncertain generally occidentals policy is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities however management may elect to hedge the price risk of crude oil natural gas ngls and refined products in the future 

recent global economic and political conditions have driven oil and gas prices down significantly these conditions may continue for an extended period continued reductions in commodity prices could require us to further reduce capital spending share repurchases debt reduction and impair the carrying value of assets 

the prices obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the united states and global economies as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

occidentals restructuring activities may affect its stock price 

occidental has performed a strategic review of its operations which resulted in the restructuring and the separation or divestiture of various assets this activity and further implementation of the strategic review may affect the market value of occidentals common stock for example occidental may take different actions than expected receive less proceeds or retain more liabilities than anticipated in connection with any divestitures 

occidental may experience delays cost overruns losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities 

occidental bears the risks of equipment failures construction delays escalating costs or competition for services materials supplies or labor property or border 

disputes disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns 

exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses 

governmental actions and political instability may affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s businesses are subject to the decisions of many federal state local and foreign governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 

 occidental has and may continue to experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability nationalizations corruption armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources 

occidentals oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves 

results of operations reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend in part on occidental’s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves occidental has many competitors including national oil companies some of which i are larger and better funded ii may be willing to accept greater risks or iii have special competencies competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts in addition during periods of low product prices any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts 

 

occidental’s acquisition activities also carry risks that it may i not fully realize anticipated benefits due to lessthanexpected reserves or production or changed circumstances such as the deterioration of natural gas prices in recent years and the recent significant decline in oil prices ii bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties iii experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity or iv assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated 

occidental’s oil and gas reserves are based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability including production decline rates operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices as well as capital and operating costs if occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected 

concerns about climate change may affect occidental’s operations 

occidental could face risks of project execution increased costs and taxes and lower demand for and restrictions or prohibition on the use of its products as a result of legislation regulations or policies that seek to control or reduce the production use or emissions of “greenhouse gases” ghg to control or reduce the production or consumption of fossil fuels or to increase the use of renewable or alternative energy sources the uncertain outcome and timing of existing and proposed international national and state ghg measures make it difficult to predict any business impact 

occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic events 

the occurrence of events such as hurricanes floods droughts earthquakes other acts of nature well blowouts fires explosions chemical releases industrial accidents physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses 

cyber attacks could significantly affect occidental 

cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years occidental relies on electronic systems and networks to control and manage its oil and gas chemicals trading and pipeline operations and has multiple layers of security to mitigate risks of cyber attack if however occidental were to experience an attack and its security measures failed the potential consequences to its businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant 

occidentals oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and may not be fully comparable to that of other companies 

management expects improved recovery extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors such as geology government regulations and permits and the effectiveness of development plans are partially or fully outside managements control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda 

in this report occidental means occidental petroleum corporation opc or opc and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest subsidiaries occidentals principal businesses consist of three segments the oil and gas segment explores for develops and produces oil and condensate natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas the chemical segment oxychem mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and 

 

vinyls the midstream marketing and other segment midstream and marketing gathers processes transports stores purchases and markets oil condensate ngls natural gas carbon dioxide co 2  and power it also trades around its assets including transportation and storage capacity and trades oil ngls gas and power additionally the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities 

strategy 

general 

through its operations occidental aims to maximize total returns to stockholders using the following strategies 

 in conducting its business occidental accepts commodity engineering and limited exploration risks capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks 

the fourth quarter of 2014 saw a sharp decline in oil and ngls prices price volatility is inherent in the oil and gas business and in order to manage this risk occidental maintains a low debt to capitalization ratio and retains sufficient cash on hand occidental will focus on lowering its costs which over time management believes will correlate to increasing and decreasing oil prices 

with respect to the strategic initiatives announced last year occidental has 

 as a result of these strategic initiatives occidental ended the year with 78 billion in total cash cash equivalents and restricted cash which exceeds its longterm debt of 68 billion 

the following describes the application of occidental’s overall strategy to each of its operating segments 

 

oil and gas 

the oil and gas business implements occidentals strategy primarily by 

 over the past several years occidental built a large portfolio of growthoriented assets in the united states in 2014 occidental spent a much larger portion of its investment capital on the development of this portfolio acquisitions in 2014 were approximately 16 billion and comprised mainly of permian basin properties this acquisition activity reflects occidentals strategy to capitalize on the opportunities presented by its existing portfolio of assets and strong balance sheet 

management believes occidentals oil and gas segment growth will occur primarily through exploitation and development opportunities in the permian basin and focused international projects in the middle east 

chemical 

the primary objective of oxychem is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve abovecostofcapital returns the chemical segments strategy is to be a lowcost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine which is coproduced with caustic soda and markets both to third parties in addition chlorine together with ethylene is converted through a series of intermediate products into pvc oxychems focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chloralkali and pvc businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities in early 2014 oxychem completed construction and began operating a 182500 tonperyear membrane chloralkali plant in tennessee and through a 5050 joint venture with mexichem sab de cv broke ground on a 12 billion poundperyear ethylene cracker at the oxychem ingleside facility the joint venture provides an opportunity to capitalize on the advantage that us shale gas development has presented to us chemical producers by providing lowcost ethane as a raw material 

and is expected to begin operating in 2017 in the third quarter oxychem completed construction and began operating a 162000 tons per year hydrochloric acid synthesis unit at its existing niagara falls ny facility 

midstream and marketing 

the midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing use of its assets including its transportation and storage capacity and by providing access to multiple markets in order to generate returns the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to other occidental segments as well as third parties the segment invests in and operates gas plants cogeneration facilities pipeline systems and storage facilities the segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas power and other commodities used in occidentals businesses while limiting credit risk exposure capital is employed to sustain or where appropriate increase operational and transportation capacity and to improve the competitiveness of occidentals assets during 2014 occidental sold its interest in bridgetex pipeline while retaining access to united states gulf markets through the pipeline resulting in a 633 million pretax gain the bridgetex pipeline transports crude oil between the permian region and the united states gulf coast refinery markets and began service in the second half of 2014 simultaneously with the sale of occidentals interest in the bridgetex pipeline occidental completed the sale of a portion of its investment in plains pipeline resulting in a 14 billion pretax gain 

key performance indicators 

general 

occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return in addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics 

 

debt structure 

in 2014 occidental decreased its debt balance by 101 million the debttocapitalization debt and equity ratio was 16 percent and 14 percent as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

 

oil and gas segment 

oil and gas information related to california resources have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

business environment 

oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s short and intermediateterm financial performance the following table presents the average daily west texas intermediate wti brent and new york mercantile exchange nymex prices for 2014  and 2013  



the following table presents occidentals average realized prices as a percentage of wti brent and nymex for 2014  and 2013  



average worldwide realized oil prices fell 868 or 9 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 approximately half of occidental’s oil production tracks world oil prices such as brent and half tracks wti the average realized domestic natural gas price in 2014 increased 23 percent from 2013 the wti and brent oil price indexes declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 settling at 5327 per barrel and 5733 per barrel respectively as of december 31 2014 the wti and brent oil price indexes settled at 9842 per barrel and 11080 per barrel respectively as of december 31 2013 

prices and differentials can vary significantly even on a shortterm basis making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty 

operations 

domestic interests 

occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns occidentals domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years which is extended through the end of production once it commences of the total 45 million net acres in which occidental has interests approximately 87 percent is leased 12 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights 

productionsharing contracts psc 

occidental has interests that are operated under pscs or similar contracts in bahrain iraq libya oman qatar and yemen under such contracts occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain production costs and an additional share for profit in addition certain contracts in colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher

permian basin 

occidentals permian basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas the basin extends throughout southwest texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states accounting for approximately 16 percent of the total united states oil production occidental is the largest operator and the largest producer of oil in the permian basin with an approximate 13 percent net share of the total oil production in the basin occidental also produces and processes natural gas and ngls in the basin 

occidental manages its permian basin operations through two business units permian resources which includes growthoriented unconventional opportunities and permian eor enhanced oil recovery which utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques such as co 2   floods and waterfloods during 2014 capital efficiency efforts reduced drilling costs per well by 8 percent for the permian basin operations in addition management began transitioning to a horizontal drilling program to take advantage of shale and other unconventional opportunities in the permian basin occidental spent over 26 billion of capital in 2014 with 73 percent spent on permian resources assets in 2015 permian basin capital spending is expected to be approximately 22 billion approximately 78 percent of the total capital to be spent in the permian basin is planned for permian resources assets to focus on growing oil production 

occidentals permian resources operations are among its fastestgrowing assets and held approximately 25 million net acres at the end of 2014 including acreage with prospective resource potential the development program largely began in 2010 continued to increase in 2014 accounting for 280 wells drilled in 2014 permian resources drilled 167 horizontal wells and expects to drill the same number of horizontal wells in 2015 permian resources has a sizeable inventory of wells to develop with economic returns in a low price environment continued completion optimization the application of enhanced manufacturing principles combined with expected commercial savings is expected to increase the well inventory even further production from this business unit comes from approximately 13000 gross wells of which 61 percent are operated by other producers on a net basis 

this represents approximately 5500 wells of which only 22 percent are operated by others 

permian eor operates a combination of co 2  floods and waterfloods which have similar development characteristics and ongoing monitoring and maintenance requirements due to a unique combination of characteristics the permian basin has been a leader in the implementation of co 2  enhanced oil recovery projects the permian basin’s concentration of large conventional reservoirs favorable co 2  flooding performance and the proximity to naturally occurring co 2  supply has resulted in decades of steady growth in enhanced oil production with over 30 active floods and 40 years of experience permian eor is the industry leader in permian basin co 2  flooding 

numerous projects have demonstrated that co 2  injection can increase the recovery from permian basin reservoirs by more than 25 percent significant opportunity remains to expand occidentals existing projects into new portions of reservoirs occidental operates reservoirs that thus far have only been water flooded leaving opportunity for significant additional recovery with new co 2  injection hence even small improvements in recovery efficiency can add significant reserves technology improvements such as the recent trend towards vertical expansion of the co 2  flooded interval into residual oil zone targets continue to yield more recovery from existing projects over the last few years occidental has had an ongoing program of deepening wells with 109 wells deepened in 2014 and 81 wells planned in 2015 occidental utilizes workover rigs to drill the extra depth into additional co 2  floodable sections of the reservoir these are low cost projects which can add reserves even in a low price environment permian eor has a large inventory of future co 2  projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated depending on market conditions 

the current strategy for permian eor is to invest sufficient capital to maintain current production thereby providing cash flow after capital to support growth in permian resources by exploiting natural synergies between permian eor and permian resources occidental is able to deliver unique advantages efficiencies and expertise across its permian basin operations occidentals share of production in the permian basin was approximately 222000 boe per day in 2014 with 75000 boe per day coming from permian resources and 147000 boe per day from permian eor 

midcontinent and other 

in april 2014 occidental sold its hugoton field operations in kansas oklahoma and colorado for 13 billion and recorded a pretax gain on the sale of 531 million 

the remaining midcontinent and other properties include interests in the williston basin the piceance basin the eagle ford shale and other areas in south texas these properties are located in north dakota colorado and texas occidental holds approximately 303000 net acres of oilproducing and unconventional properties in the williston basins bakken three forks and pronghorn formations as well as approximately 187000 net acres in 

 

the piceance area and 174000 net acres in south texas including 4000 net acres in the eagle ford shale 

in midcontinent and other excluding hugoton field operations occidental drilled approximately 99 wells and produced approximately 90000 boe per day in 2014 

other developments 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 commodity prices declined significantly causing occidental to assess the carrying value of its domestic producing assets and assess development plans for its nonproducing assets in the fourth quarter of 2014 occidental recorded pretax impairment charges of 27 billion in the williston basin 904 million related to its gas and ngls assets and 589 million for other domestic acreage in the second quarter of 2014 occidental also recorded a pretax impairment charge of 471 million for certain nonproducing domestic acreage that management decided not to pursue any further sustained declines in commodity prices may result in additional impairments in the future

bahrain 

in 2009 occidental and other consortium members began operating the bahrain field under a 20year development and production sharing agreement dpsa occidental has a 48percent working interest in the joint venture since handover of operations the consortium has increased gross gas production capacity 50 percent from an initial level of 15 billion cubic feet per day to over 23 billion cubic feet per day and increased gross oil production from 26000 barrels per day to more than 44000 barrels per day occidentals share of production from bahrain during 2014 was approximately 236 million cubic feet mmcf of gas per day and 4000 barrels of oil per day 

occidental has been pursuing opportunities to adjust terms of the dpsa to more accurately reflect current operating and economic challenges under the contract however occidental has not yet been successful in obtaining these concessions due to deteriorating market conditions occidental has recorded a pretax impairment charge of 801 million for its investments in bahrain 

iraq 

in 2010 occidental and other consortium members signed a 20year contract with the south oil company of iraq to develop the zubair field in 2013 the terms were improved reflecting a reduction in the targeted production level to 850000 boe per day and a fiveyear extension to 2035 occidentals interest in this contract entitles occidental to receive oil for cost recovery and a remuneration fee delays in implementation of development plans have limited the amount of production from iraq occidental does not know when development activities will reach desired levels occidentals share of production from iraq was approximately 13000 boe per day in 2014  

libya 

occidental participates with the libyan national oil company in the sirte basin producing operations these agreements continue through 2032 in 2014 occidental suspended exploration activities due to civil unrest in the country production disruptions continued throughout 2014 due to oil field and export terminal strikes and closures occidental does not know when operations will return to normal levels the 2014 production volumes were insignificant 

oman 

in oman occidental is the operator of block 9 and block 27 with a 65percent working interest in each block block 53 with a 45percent working interest and block 62 with a 48percent working interest 

the term for block 9 continues through december 2015 with a 10year extension right for certain areas subject to government approval the term for block 27 expires in 2035 

a 30year psc for the mukhaizna field block 53 was signed with the government of oman in 2005 pursuant to which occidental assumed operation of the field by the end of 2014  occidental had drilled more than 2400 new wells and continued implementation of a major steamflood project in 2014  the average gross daily production was 122000 boe per day which was over 15 times higher than the production rate in september 2005 when occidental assumed operations 

in 2008 occidental was awarded a 20year contract for block 62 subject to declaration of commerciality where it is pursuing development and exploration opportunities targeting gas and condensate resources in 2014 occidental signed a five year extension for the initial phase for the discovered non associated gas area natural gas not in contact with crude oil in a reservoir for block 62 

occidentals share of production from oman was approximately 76000 boe per day in 2014  

 

qatar 

in qatar occidental is the operator at idd el shargi north dome isnd and idd el shargi south dome issd with a 100percent working interest in each and al rayyan block 12 with a 925percent working interest the terms for isnd issd and block 12 expire in 2019 2022 and 2017 respectively 

in 2014 occidental continued to develop the isnd field to improve ultimate recovery in all existing contract reservoirs 

occidentals dolphin investment comprises two separate economic interests through which occidental owns i a 245percent undivided interest in the upstream operations under a dpsa with the government of qatar to develop and produce natural gas and ngls in qatar’s north field through mid2032 with a provision to request a fiveyear extension and ii a 245percent interest in the stock of dolphin energy limited dolphin energy which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in midstream and marketing segment  pipeline transportation 

occidentals share of production from qatar was approximately 107000 boe per day in 2014 

united arab emirates 

in 2011 occidental acquired a 40percent participating interest in the al hosn gas project joining with the abu dhabi national oil company adnoc in a 30year joint venture agreement once fully operational the project is anticipated to produce over 450 mmcf per day of natural gas and 75000 barrels per day of ngls and condensate of which occidental’s net share would be over 180 mmcf per day and 30000 barrels per day respectively initial start up of production from this project commenced in january 2015 and is proceeding as planned 

additionally the al hosn gas project includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in midstream and marketing segment  gas processing plants and co 2  fields and facilities 

occidental conducts a majority of its middle east business development activities through its office in abu dhabi which also provides various support functions for occidental’s middle eastnorth africa oil and gas operations 

yemen 

in yemen occidental owns interests in block 10 east shabwa field which extends through december 2015 with a 404percent interest that includes an 118percent interest held in an unconsolidated entity and block s1 an nagyah field which is an occidentaloperated block with a 75percent working interest that extends into 2023 

given the political instability and civil unrest in yemen production levels may be unpredictable for the remainder of the block 10 contract term and it is unlikely the contract will be extended occidentals share of production from the yemen properties was approximately 10000 boe per day in 2014

bolivia 

occidental holds working interests in the tarija chuquisaca and santa cruz regions of bolivia which produce gas occidentals share of production from bolivia was 2000 boe per day in 2014 

colombia 

occidental has a working interest in the la cirainfantas area and has operations within the llanos norte basin occidentals interests range from 39 to 61 percent and certain interests expire between 2023 and 2030 while others extend through the economic limit of the areas occidentals share of production was approximately 27000 boe per day in 2014 

proved reserves 

proved oil ngls and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements oil ngls and gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity quality and transportation costs for the 2014 2013 and 2012 disclosures the calculated average west texas intermediate oil prices were 9499 9694 and 9471 per barrel respectively the calculated average brent oil prices for 2014 2013 and 2012 disclosures were 9951 10876 and 11170 per barrel respectively the calculated average henry hub gas prices for 2014 2013 and 2012 were 442 365 and 279 per mmbtu respectively 

occidental had proved reserves at yearend 2014 of 2819 million boe compared to the yearend 2013 amount of 2738 million boe proved reserves at yearend 2014 and 2013 consisted of respectively 63 percent and 59 percent oil 13 percent and 12 percent ngls and 24 percent and 29 percent natural gas proved developed reserves represented approximately 71 percent and 70 percent respectively of occidental’s total proved reserves at yearend 2014 and 2013 

 

occidental does not have any reserves from nontraditional sources for further information regarding occidentals proved reserves see supplemental oil and gas information following the financial statements 

proved reserve additions 

occidentals total proved reserve additions from all sources were 380 million boe in 2014  and included 337 million boe from occidentals development program net of revisions of prior estimates and 43 million boe from purchases 

the total additions were as follows 



occidentals ability to add reserves other than through purchases depends on the success of improved recovery extension and discovery projects each of which depends on reservoir characteristics technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices as well as capital and operating costs many of these factors are outside management’s control and will affect whether these historical sources of proved reserve additions continue at similar levels occidentals 2014 development program provided approximately 265 million boe of reserve additions domestically 

improved recovery 

in 2014 occidental added proved reserves of 354 million boe from improved recovery through its eor and infill drilling activities generally the improved recovery additions in 2014 were mostly associated with the continued development of properties in the permian basin these properties comprise both conventional projects which are characterized by the deployment of eor development methods largely employing application of co 2 flood waterflood or steam flood and unconventional projects these types of conventional eor development methods can be applied through existing wells though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells the use of either co 2  or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation the evaluation of engineering data availability and cost of either co 2  or steam and other economic factors both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells many of occidentals projects including unconventional projects rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells in addition some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells 

extensions and discoveries 

occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs in 2014  extensions and discoveries added 41 million boe related primarily to the recognition of proved undeveloped reserves from the permian basin and oman 

purchases of proved reserves 

occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable as market conditions change the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly in 2014  occidental added 43 million boe through purchases of proved reserves largely consisting of domestic acquisitions mainly in the permian basin 

revisions of previous estimates 

revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic production decline or operating performance data in addition product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental for example higher prices may increase the economically recoverable reserves particularly for domestic properties because the extra margin extends the expected life of the operations offsetting this effect higher prices decrease occidentals share of proved reserves under pscs because less oil is required to recover costs conversely when prices drop occidentals share of proved reserves increases for pscs and economically recoverable reserves may drop for other operations in 2014 revisions of previous estimates provided a decrease of 58 million boe to proved reserves occidental had positive technical revisions of 7 million boe which exclude the impact of negative revisions in bahrain of 54 million boe and price revisions of 11 million boe 

reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data 

proved undeveloped reserves 

in 2014 occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 328 million boe from improved recovery extensions and discoveries and purchases of the total additions 284 million boe represented additions from improved recovery primarily in the permian basin occidental added 15 million boe through domestic acquisitions mainly in the permian basin additionally the proved undeveloped reserves increased 29 million boe due to extensions and discoveries mainly in oman and the permian basin these proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by transfers of 315 million boe to the proved developed category as a result of the 2014 development programs including 214 million boe from al hosn gas project reserves occidental incurred approximately 17 billion in 2014 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves al hosn permian basin oman williston basin and south texas accounted for approximately 93 percent of the 

 

reserve transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2014 a substantial portion of the proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 2014 was the result of the development program in the permian basin which represents 55 percent of total yearend proved undeveloped reserves 

recent global economic conditions have driven oil and gas prices down significantly these conditions may continue for an extended period prolonged or further declines in commodity prices could require occidental to further reduce capital spending potentially impacting either the quantity or the development timing of proved undeveloped reserves 

reserves evaluation and review process 

occidentals estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of december 31 2014 were made by occidental’s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management the estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by occidental to develop the reserves this process involves reservoir engineers geoscientists planning engineers and financial analysts as part of the proved reserves estimation process all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates operating costs and capital expenditures price differentials between benchmark prices the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods including estimates from decline curve analysis typecurve analysis material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance these fieldtested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities 

net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 

the current senior vice president reserves for oxy oil and gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates in compliance with us securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations including the internal audit and review of occidentals oil and gas reserves data the senior vice president has over 30 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business and has held various assignments in north america asia and europe he is a 

threetime past chair of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee he is an american association of petroleum geologists aapg certified petroleum geologist and currently serves on the aapg committee on resource evaluation he is a member of the society of petroleum evaluation engineers the colorado school of mines potential gas committee and the unece expert group on resource classification he is also an active member of the joint committee on reserves evaluator training jcoret the senior vice president has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in geology from emory university in atlanta 

occidental has a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee consisting of senior corporate officers to review and approve occidentals oil and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidentals board of directors during the year since 2003 occidental has retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum engineering consultants to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes 

in 2014 ryder scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of december 31 2014 in accordance with the sec regulatory standards ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of occidental’s 2014 yearend total proved reserves portfolio in 2014 ryder scott reviewed approximately 24 percent of occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves since being engaged in 2003 ryder scott has reviewed the specific application of occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 72 percent of occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves management retains ryder scott to provide objective thirdparty input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by occidental occidental has filed ryder scotts independent report as an exhibit to this form 10k 

based on its reviews including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current sec regulations 

 

industry outlook 

the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions the wti and brent oil price indexes declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 settling at 5327 per barrel and 5733 per barrel from 9842 per barrel and 11080 per barrel respectively as of december 31 2014 and 2013 

oil prices will continue to be affected by i global supply and demand which are generally a function of global economic conditions inventory levels production disruptions technological advances regional market conditions and the actions of opec other significant producers and governments ii transportation capacity infrastructure constraints and cost in producing areas iii currency exchange rates and iv the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions 

ngls prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock in addition infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region 

domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas 

these and other factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil ngls and domestic gas prices reliably international gas prices are generally fixed under longterm contracts occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital 

chemical segment 

business environment 

the modest pace of united states economic growth resulted in slightly higher demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks chlorovinyl margins were challenged throughout the year as unprecedented unplanned and planned ethylene cracker outages significantly affected the supply of ethylene resulting in historically high ethylene prices chemical segment earnings excluding asset impairments in 2014 and the gain on sale of the investment in carbocloro in 2013 decreased in 2014 primarily due to higher energy and ethylene costs and lower chloralkali pricing driven by continued unfavorable supply and demand fundamentals 

business review 

basic chemicals 

during 2014 the united states economy continued its slow recovery with fullyear growth expected to show only a slight improvement from the prior year the improvement to the economy contributed to moderate improvements in domestic chemical demand despite the commissioning of three chloralkali plants in the us including oxychem’s 182500 tonperyear membrane plant in tennessee industry chlorine operating rates remained relatively flat 

with 2013 at approximately 84 percent which resulted in chlorine prices ending approximately 6 percent below where they began exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain were competitive for the first half of 2014 but were negatively impacted by a significant increase in ethylene prices as third quarter supply was restricted by historically high ethylene cracker plant outages liquid caustic soda prices experienced downward price pressure during the first quarter as the industry absorbed the additional chloralkali capacity that came online export demand and pricing remains under pressure due to global over capacity and lower growth in major consuming regions such as latin american and asia businesses such as calcium chloride potassium hydroxide and muriatic acid improved compared to 2013 as domestic demand improved and margins remained stable throughout the year 

vinyls 

domestic pvc demand in 2014 grew by approximately 3 percent compared to 2013 as the housing and commercial construction markets continued their recovery despite the improvement in the domestic market the industry operating rate decreased by slightly more than 2 percent due to a combination of industry outages early in 2014 and export demand declining by approximately 10 percent compared to the prior year industry margins improved in 2014 due to first quarter pvc price increases which were partially offset by higher ethylene prices during the first half of 2014 north america ethanebased ethylene production continued to be price advantaged over europe and asia but is reaching parity with the rest of the world as the price of oil declines despite the yearoveryear reduction in north american exports of pvc export volumes represented nearly 30 percent of total pvc sales of north american producers construction commenced on the ingleside texas ethylene cracker during the first half of 2014 and commercial operations are expected to begin in early 2017 

industry outlook 

industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy specifically in the housing construction automotive and durable goods markets margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices longterm weakness in the petroleum industry may negatively affect the demand and pricing of a number of occidental’s products that are consumed exclusively by industry participants 

basic chemicals 

occidental expects that if the united states housing automotive and durable goods markets continue to improve domestic demand for basic chemical products should be higher in 2015 overall the increase in chloralkali capacity may restrict significant price improvement but anticipated higher demand from strengthening global markets coupled with lower natural gas prices should allow for moderate chlorine and caustic soda margin improvement in 2015 the continued competitiveness of downstream chlorine derivatives in global markets is contingent on united states feedstock costs primarily 

 

natural gas and ethylene remaining favorable compared to other feedstock costs in global markets 

  

vinyls 

north american demand and operating rates should improve in 2015 if growth in both housing starts and commercial construction continues occidental expects us export demand to increase in 2015 and margins to improve over 2014 

midstream and marketing segment 

business environment 

midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing and trading businesses and its processing transportation and power generation assets the marketing and trading businesses aggregate and market occidentals and thirdparty volumes trade commodities and engage in storage activities marketing and trading performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segments plants and pipelines as well as the margins obtained on related services 

the midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2014  excluding the gains from the sales of the bridgetex pipeline and a portion of an investment in plains pipeline were greater than 2013 reflecting higher income from the gas processing and power generation businesses partially offset by lower marketing performance and pipeline income 

business review 

marketing and trading 

the marketing and trading group markets substantially all of occidental’s oil ngls and gas production trades around its assets including its own and third party transportation and storage capacity and engages in commodities trading occidental’s thirdparty marketing and trading activities focus on purchasing oil ngls and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets these purchases allow occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets marketing performance in 2014 declined compared to 2013 due to lower margins on crude oil and ngls partially offset by higher margins in natural gas in the second half of 2014 occidental commenced winding down its phibro commodity trading operations as of yearend there was no material exposure related to phibro’s remaining activities 

gas processing plants and co 2  fields and facilities 

occidental processes its and thirdparty domestic wet gas to extract ngls and other gas byproducts including co 2  and delivers dry gas to pipelines margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for ngls occidental’s 2014  earnings from these operations increased compared to 2013  due to the multiple plant turnarounds in the permian basin operations during 2013 

occidental together with adnoc completed the al hosn gas processing facilities in abu dhabi at the end of 2014 the al hosn gas processing facilities are designed to process 10 bcf per day of natural gas and separate it into sales gas condensate ngls and sulfur the al hosn gas processing facilities includes processing and treatment facilities sulfur recovery units including facilities to extract sulfur from natural gas and to load and store sulfur the project is anticipated to produce approximately 8700 tons per day of sulfur of which occidentals share would be 3500 tons of sulfur per day the al hosn gas processing facilities will generate revenues from gas processing fees and the sale of sulfur 

pipeline transportation 

margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped dolphin energy owns and operates a 230milelong 48inchdiameter natural gas pipeline dolphin pipeline which transports dry natural gas from qatar to the uae and oman the dolphin pipeline contributes significantly to occidentals pipeline transportation results through occidentals 245percent interest in dolphin energy the dolphin pipeline has capacity to transport up to 32 bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 23 bcf per day dolphin pipeline is currently expanding gas compression facilities to achieve maximum pipeline capacity occidental believes substantial opportunities remain to provide gas transportation to additional customers in the region to reach the full capacity of the dolphin pipeline and generate additional midstream revenues and cash flows 

occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2900 miles of pipelines from southeast new mexico across the permian basin of southwest texas to cushing oklahoma the system has a current throughput capacity of about 720000 barrels per day 60 million barrels of active storage capability and 108 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline 

during 2014 occidental sold its interest in bridgetex pipeline while retaining access to united states gulf markets through the pipeline the bridgetex pipeline transports crude oil between the permian region and the united states gulf coast refinery markets and began service in the second half of 2014 simultaneously with the sale of occidentals interest in the bridgetex pipeline occidental completed the sale of a portion of its investment in plains pipeline following the fourth quarter 2014 sale of a portion of its investment occidental owns approximately 13 percent of plains pipeline the plains pipeline investment contributed approximately 19 percent of the segments earnings for 2014 excluding the gain from the sale 

occidentals 2014 pipeline transportation earnings declined from 2013 due to lower income from its investment in plains pipeline as a result of occidentals lower ownership interest 

 

power generation facilities 

earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties and the increase in earnings in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to higher margins from higher spark spreads and production 

  

industry outlook 

the pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable the gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending mostly on ngls prices which cannot reasonably be predicted generally higher ngls prices result in higher profitability although the marketing and trading business in isolation can be volatile in periods of severe price swings occidental does not expect the volatility of these operations to be significant to the company as a whole given occidentals framework of controls and risk management occidental continues to actively focus on marketing its commodity production to generate maximum value for its stakeholders 

segment results of operations 

segment earnings exclude income taxes interest income interest expense environmental remediation expenses unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments equity investments seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in occidentals consolidated quarterly earnings during the year 

the statements of income and cash flows and supplemental oil and gas information related to california resources have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of california resources were removed from occidentals consolidated balance sheet as of november 30 2014 

the following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items 



 

oil and gas 



 

the following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil ngls and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014  the differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at occidental’s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers 







 

oil and gas segment earnings in 2014 included pretax charges of 53 billion related to the impairment of domestic and international assets and the gain from the sale of hugoton assets and earnings in 2013 included pretax charges of 06 billion for the impairment of domestic nonproducing acreage in 2012 oil and gas segment earnings included pretax charges of 17 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items 

 

domestic oil and gas segment earnings excluding impairment and other charges in both years were 19 billion in 2014 compared to 25 billion in 2013 the decrease in domestic earnings reflected lower crude oil and ngls prices higher operating costs from increased workover and maintenance activities and higher dda expenses partially offset by higher crude oil production volumes and improved realized prices for gas international oil and gas segment earnings excluding impairments were 40 billion in 2014 and 46 billion in 2013 international earnings reflected lower realized crude oil prices and sales volumes partially offset by lower operating expenses and dda 

average production costs for 2014 excluding taxes other than on income were 1350 per boe compared to 1256 per boe for 2013 the increase in average costs reflects increased domestic activity in downhole maintenance and higher costs for purchased injectants 

average daily oil and gas production volumes excluding hugoton production were flat at 591000 boe in 2014 and 2013 average domestic daily production increased by 10000 boe to 312000 boe in 2014 during this same time period domestic daily oil production increased by over 6 percent or 11000 barrels per day to 181000 barrels mainly coming from permian resources international average daily production volumes decreased to 279000 boe in 2014 from 289000 boe in 2013 the decrease was primarily due to lower cost recovery barrels in iraq and insurgent activities in colombia libya and yemen total company average daily sales volumes excluding hugoton were 592000 boe in 2014 and 590000 boe in 2013 

domestic oil and gas segment earnings excluding impairments in both years were 25 billion in 2013 compared to 22 billion in 2012 the increase in domestic earnings reflected higher crude oil and gas prices higher crude oil volumes and lower operating costs partially offset by higher dda expense international segment earnings were 46 billion in 2013 and 55 billion in 2012 the decrease in international earnings reflected lower crude oil prices and volumes as well as higher operating costs and dda rates in the middle eastnorth africa 

 average daily oil and gas production volumes excluding hugoton were 591000 boe for 2013 compared to 599000 boe for 2012 occidentals 2013 average daily domestic oil and ngls production increased by 8000 boe or 5 percent and 1000 boe respectively as compared to 2012 while gas production decreased by 30 mmcf or 6 percent as occidental focused its development program on oil production international average daily production volumes decreased to 289000 boe in 2013 compared to 301000 boe in 2012 primarily from lower cost recovery barrels from dolphin and oman and higher levels of insurgent activities in libya average daily sales volumes excluding hugoton were 590000 boe in 2013 compared to 598000 boe in 2012 

chemical 



chemical segment earnings excluding asset impairments of 149 million in 2014 and gain on sale of 131 million from the sale of the carbocloro investment were 569 million in 2014 compared to 612 million in 2013 the lower earnings in 2014 were primarily a result of lower caustic soda pricing driven by new chloralkali capacity in the industry and higher energy and ethylene costs partially offset by higher pvc margins and improved volumes across most product lines 

chemical segment earnings were 612 million in 2013  excluding the 131 million gain on sale of carbocloro investment compared to 720 million in 2012  the yearoveryear change in chemical segment earnings reflected higher energy and ethylene costs and lower chloralkali and chlorinated organics pricing driven by continued unfavorable supply and demand fundamentals and reduced export demand 

midstream marketing and other 



midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2014  excluding impairments and other items and gains on sales of 20 billion in 2014 and 10 billion in 2013 were 549 million in 2014 compared to 537 million in 2013 the increase in earnings reflected higher income from the gas processing and power generation businesses partially offset by lower marketing performance and pipeline income 

midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2013  were 537 million excluding the 10 billion pretax gain from the sale of a portion of an investment in plains pipeline and other items compared to 396 million in 2012 the 2013 results reflected higher earnings in the pipeline and power generation businesses and improved marketing and trading performance marketing performance improved by 110 million mainly as a result of capturing regional crude price differentials by utilizing new pipelines providing access to the united states gulf coast refineries these improvements were partially offset by lower income in the gas processing business due in part to the plant turnarounds in the permian basin operations 

significant items affecting earnings 

the following table sets forth for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 significant transactions and events affecting occidental’s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature timing and amount 

 



taxes 

deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets of 14 billion were 29 billion at december 31 2014  the current portion of the deferred tax assets of 110 million is included in other current assets the deferred tax assets net of allowances are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences 

worldwide effective tax rate 

the following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations 





occidental’s 2014 worldwide tax rate was 109 percent which was higher than 2013 mainly due to an other than temporary loss on occidental’s available for sale investment in california resources stock and the oil and gas international asset impairments of 11 billion neither of which had a tax benefit to a lesser degree foreign pretax income was proportionately higher in 2014 which is generally taxed at a higher rate than domestic pretax income the 2013 worldwide tax rate was lower than 2012 due to proportionately higher domestic pretax income in 2013 

a deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries as it is occidental’s intention generally to reinvest such earnings permanently if the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested an additional deferred tax liability of approximately 140 million would be required assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits 

consolidated results of operations 

changes in components of occidentals results of continuing operations are discussed below 

revenue and other income items 



the decrease in net sales in 2014  compared to 2013  was mainly due to a significant decline in worldwide oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 and to a lesser extent decline in ngls prices partially offset by higher domestic oil volumes and higher domestic natural gas prices 

the increase in net sales in 2013  compared to 2012  was due to improved domestic oil and gas realized prices and higher crude oil volumes partially offset by lower international liquids volumes and oil prices 

price and volume changes in the oil and gas segment generally represent about 70 percent of the change in oil and gas segment income which is a substantially larger portion of the overall change in net income than the chemical and midstream and marketing segments 

the 2014 gains on sale included 14 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in plains pipeline 633 million for the sale of bridgetex pipeline and 531 million for the sale of hugoton properties the 2013 gains on sale included 10 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in plains pipeline and 131 million for the sale of the carbocloro investment 

 

expense items 



cost of sales increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment and increased domestic down hole maintenance activities and higher costs for purchased injectants in the oil and gas segment 

cost of sales decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower oil and gas operating costs partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses in 2014 were approximately equivalent to 2013 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2013 due to higher compensation and employeerelated costs in particular higher equity compensation due to higher stock prices as well as the charge related to the employment and postemployment benefits for occidentals former executive chairman and termination of certain other employees and consulting arrangements 

dda increased in each year from 2012 to 2014  generally due to higher dda rates and to a lesser extent the changes in volumes in the oil and gas segment 

asset impairments and related items in 2014 of 74 billion included 28 billion in the williston basin 904 million related to occidentals gas and ngls assets 889 million for other domestic acreage and 11 billion primarily related to operations in bahrain and other international operations asset impairments also include charges for joslyn oil sands of 805 million and an other than temporary loss of 553 million for the available for sale investment in california resources stock see note 15 of the consolidated financial statements 

asset impairments and related items in 2013 of 621 million were mostly related to the impairment of certain nonproducing domestic oil and gas acreage 

asset impairments and related items in 2012 were almost all in midcontinent over 90 percent of which were related to natural gas properties that were acquired previously when gas prices were above 6 per mcf 

taxes other than on income in 2014 were approximately equivalent to 2013 from 2013 to 2012 taxes other than on income increased primarily due to rising prices 

other items 



provision for income taxes decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower pretax income partially offset by certain nondeductible charges which increased the effective rate 

provision for income taxes increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher pretax income partially offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate the lower tax rate was due to higher proportional domestic pretax income in 2013 compared to 2012 

income from equity investments decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to occidental’s reduced ownership in the plains pipeline as portions of the investment were sold in fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013 the increase in equity income in 2013 compared to 2012 reflected higher earnings from occidental’s equity investments in pipelines 

consolidated analysis of financial position 

the changes in select components of occidental’s balance sheet are discussed below 

balance sheet components 



assets 

see liquidity and capital resources — cash flow analysis for discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 

the decline in trade receivables net was due to lower oil and gas prices at the end of 2014 compared to the end of 2013 the decrease in inventories primarily resulted from lower storage inventories the decrease in other current assets mainly reflected the spinoff of california resources the decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities was 

 

due to the sale of a portion of occidentals interest in plains pipeline the retained interest in california resources after the separation is recorded as an available for sale investment the decrease in ppe net was due to the spinoff of california resources dda and asset impairments partially offset by capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and gas properties 

liabilities and stockholders equity 

the decrease in accounts payable reflected the spinoff of california resources and lower marketing payables as a result of lower oil and gas prices at the end of 2014 partially offset by an increase in accounts payable associated with increased permian development activities 

the decrease in deferred credits and other liabilitiesincome taxes reflected the spinoff of california resources as a portion of the deferred tax liability was divested the decrease in deferred credits and other liabilitiesother was primarily due to the reduction of asset retirement obligations as a result of the spinoff of california resources the decrease in stockholders equity reflected the distribution of california resources stock as a onetime stock dividend the distribution of cash dividends and share repurchases partially offset by 2014 net income 

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2014  occidental had approximately 38 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 4 billion in restricted cash a substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the united states  and occidental believes the cash in foreign jurisdictions can be brought to the united states without paying significant taxes    income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segments prices sales volumes and costs occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs and planned capital expenditures dividends and any debt payments 

as a result of the taxfree status of the spinoff of california resources occidentals use of restricted cash is limited to the payment of dividends repayment of debt or share repurchases to retain the taxfree status of the spinoff the restricted cash must be used for one of these purposes within eighteen months from the date of distribution 

in august 2014 occidental entered into a new fiveyear 20 billion bank credit facility 2014 credit facility which replaced its previous 20 billion bank credit facility 2011 credit facility which was scheduled to expire in october 2016 the 2014 credit facility has similar terms to the 2011 credit facility and does not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict occidentals ability to borrow under this facility occidental did not draw down any amounts under the 2014 credit facility or the 2011 credit facility during 2014 and no amounts were outstanding as of december 31 2014  

as of december 31 2014  under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on or acquisitions of occidental stock 

occidental from time to time may access and has accessed debt markets for general corporate purposes including acquisitions at this time occidental does not anticipate any need for such funding 

cash flow analysis 



cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased 13 billion in 2014 to 89 billion compared to 102 billion in 2013 operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower oil prices in the second half of 2014 which on a yearoveryear basis declined 8percent domestically and 9percent worldwide and higher domestic operating expenses for increased workover activity and higher prices for purchased injectants also in 2014 occidental paid higher income taxes in part related to the fourth quarter 2013 sale of a portion of the investment in plains pipeline and the first half of 2014 sale of hugoton assets while 2013 included the collection of a tax receivable working capital changes in receivables reflected higher collections in the first half of 2014 

cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2013 increased 11 billion to 102 billion from 91 billion in 2012 the increase in operating cash flows was mainly from domestic operations driven by lower operating costs which reflected our cost savings initiatives higher realized prices for oil and gas of nearly 5 percent and 30 percent respectively and higher oil production volumes also cash flows from our foreign operations were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes in the middle eastnorth africa in addition cash flows were impacted favorably due to the collection of a federal tax receivable which was booked in 2012 and other working capital changes 

other cost elements such as labor costs and overhead are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flows than changes in oil and gas product prices sales volumes and operating costs 

the chemical and midstream and marketing segments cash flows are significantly smaller and their overall cash flows are generally less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment 

occidental booked significant noncash adjustments to income as a result of lower product prices and management’s strategic review asset impairments and related items were 74 billion 06 billion and 17 billion for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the 2014 impairments are the result of a thorough portfolio review which resulted in the reduction of carrying values for projects which have subpar returns in the current price environment the 2013 impairment was mostly related to nonproducing domestic oil and gas acreage and the 2012 

 

impairment was mainly for midcontinent gas properties that were acquired when gas prices were over 6 mcf 

occidental recorded gains from the sales of assets and equity investments of 25 billion in 2014 and 12 billion in 2013 cash proceeds related to these gains are reported as investing activities 



compared to 72 billion in 2013 occidentals net capital expenditures for 2014 were 87 billion after netting of partner contributions for the bridgetex pipeline which is included in financing activities and the chemical joint venture the increase in capital expenditures of 15 billion from 2013  to 2014  was due to increased development activity in the domestic oil and gas operations primarily permian resources the increase in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was due to higher spending for the al hosn gas project and bridgetex pipeline 

occidental’s 2015 net capital spending is expected to be 58 billion mainly allocated to permian resources and certain middle east projects occidental has minimized development activities in the williston basin domestic gas properties and bahrain as these have subpar returns in the current product price environment oil and gas capital spending is expected to be approximately 45 billion in 2015 

compared to 78 billion in 2012 occidentals net capital expenditures for 2013 were 72 billion net of partner contributions the decrease in capital expenditures from 2012 to 2013 was mainly due to the 06 billion decrease in oil and gas expenditures a majority of which was in domestic properties this reduction reflected cost savings from occidentals efficiency initiatives the increase for the chemical segment was due to the continued construction of the tennessee chloralkali facility the decrease in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was due to lower spending for the al hosn gas project partially offset by increased spending for bridgetex pipeline 

cash flows from other investing activities net increased to 27 billion in 2014 from 10 billion in 2013 the 2014 other investing activities net included proceeds of 13 billion for the sale of the hugoton field operations 11 billion for the sale of the bridgetex pipeline and 17 billion for the sale of a portion of occidental’s investment in plains pipeline which was partially offset by 17 billion of acquisitions mainly in the permian basin the 2013 other 

investing activities net included proceeds of 14 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in plains pipeline and 03 billion for the sale of chemical’s investment in carbocloro which was partially offset by acquisitions of approximately 06 billion 

the 2012 other investing activities net included 20 billion in payments for the acquisition of businesses and assets 

commitments at december 31 2014  for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures were approximately 14 billion which will be due in 2015 and beyond occidental expects to fund its commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations 



cash used for financing activities in 2014 included special cash distributions received prior to the separation of california resources of 61 billion of which 495 billion was restricted cash approximately 09 billion of the restricted cash was used for share repurchases and the fourth quarter dividend payment resulting in a 40 billion restricted cash balance as of december 31 2014 the 2014 net cash used by financing activities included 25 billion for purchases of treasury stock and 22 billion for dividend payments which were partially offset by 04 billion for contributions received from a noncontrolling interest a dividend payment was accelerated in 2012 which resulted in three dividend payments in 2013 whereas there were four cash dividend payments in 2014 

the 2013 net cash used by financing activities included 07 billion used to retire debt and 02 billion of contributions received from a noncontrolling interest common stock dividends paid decreased by 06 billion to 16 billion in 2013 due to the accelerated payment in 2012 of that years fourth quarter dividend in addition purchases of treasury stock increased from 06 billion in 2012 to over 09 billion in 2013 higher 2013 net cash use compared to 2012 also reflected the net proceeds in 2012 of approximately 17 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes that year 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of occidentals offbalancesheet arrangements 

guarantees 

occidental has guaranteed its portion of equity method investees debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds letters of credit indemnities and commitments provided by occidental to third parties mainly to provide assurance that opc or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees as of december 31 2014  occidental’s 

 

guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately 336 million of dolphin’s debt the fair value of the guarantees was immaterial 

occidental has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries for various letters of credit indemnities and commitments marketing guarantees provided to third parties for california resources total approximately 161 million as of december 31 2014 the fair value of the marketing guarantees and other obligations of california resources guaranteed by occidental were immaterial 

see oil and gas segment — business review — qatar and “segment results of operations” for further information about dolphin 

leases 

occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements mainly for transportation equipment power plants machinery terminals storage facilities land and office space occidental leases assets when leasing offers greater operating flexibility lease payments are generally expensed as part of cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses for more information see contractual obligations 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes and crossreferences occidental’s contractual obligations this summary indicates on and offbalancesheet obligations as of december 31 2014  



 

delivery commitments 

occidental has made commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil gas and ngls the total amount contracted to be delivered a substantial majority of which is in the united states is approximately 430 million barrels of oil through 2025 37 billion cubic feet of gas through 2016 and 24 million barrels of ngls through 2016 the price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall none of the commitments in any given year is expected to have a material impact on occidentals financial statements 

lawsuits claims and contingencies 

opc or certain of its subsidiaries are involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property damage or other losses punitive damages civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief opc or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar federal state local and foreign environmental laws these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties and injunctive relief usually opc or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies further some lawsuits claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction 

occidental has entered into a written settlement agreement with the state of new jersey the state to resolve claims asserted by the state against occidental arising from occidental’s acquisition of diamond shamrock chemicals company dscc and historic operations of dscc’s lister avenue plant in december 2014 the settlement was approved by the court under the settlement agreement state settlement occidental will pay the state 190 million and under certain circumstances perform or fund future work on behalf of the state along a portion of the passaic river when occidental acquired the stock of dscc in 1986 maxus energy corporation a subsidiary of ypf sa maxus retained liability for the lister avenue plant which is part of the diamond alkali superfund site as well as other sites maxus is also obligated to indemnify occidental for the state settlement occidental is pursuing maxus to recover the settlement costs the state settlement does not cover any potential occidental share of costs associated with the epa’s proposed cleanup plan of the passaic river announced in april 2014 maxus is also responsible for federal cleanup or other costs associated with the lister avenue plant and the diamond alkali superfund site 

 

occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters reserve balances for other matters as of december 31 2014  and 2013  were not material to occidentals consolidated balance sheets occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations environmental matters are further discussed under the caption environmental liabilities and expenditures below 

during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax jurisdictions although taxable years through 2009 for united states federal income tax purposes have been audited by the united states internal revenue service irs pursuant to its compliance assurance program subsequent taxable years are currently under review additionally in december 2012 occidental filed united states federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 which are subject to irs review taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions in certain of these jurisdictions tax authorities are in various stages of auditing occidentals income taxes during the course of tax audits disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

opc its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2014  occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality occidental’s environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in the future occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand 

environmental remediation 

the laws that require or address environmental remediation including cercla and similar federal state local and foreign laws may apply retroactively and regardless of fault the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites opc or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating closed and thirdparty sites remedial activities may include one or more of the following investigation involving sampling modeling risk assessment or monitoring cleanup measures including removal treatment or disposal or operation and maintenance of remedial systems the environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties injunctive relief and government oversight costs 

as of december 31 2014  occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 145 sites excluding seven sites transferred to california resources prior to december 31 2014 the following table presents occidental’s environmental remediation reserves as of december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the us environmental protection agency on the cercla national priorities list npl sites and three categories of nonnpl sites — thirdparty sites occidentaloperated sites and closed or nonoperated occidental sites 



as of december 31 2014  occidental’s environmental reserves exceeded 10 million each at 11 of the 145 sites described above and 98 of the sites had reserves from 0 to 1 million each 

as of december 31 2014  two sites — a landfill in western new york owned by occidental and a former refinery in louisiana — accounted for 62 percent of its reserves associated with npl sites in connection with a 1986 acquisition maxus energy corporation has retained the liability and is indemnifying occidental for 14 of the remaining npl sites 

as of december 31 2014  maxus has also retained the liability and is indemnifying occidental for 8 of the 67 thirdparty sites four of the remaining 59 thirdparty sites — a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee a containment and removal project in tennessee a former chemical plant in ohio and an active refinery in louisiana where occidental reimburses the current owner for certain 

 

remediation activities — accounted for 56 percent of occidental’s reserves associated with these sites 

four sites — chemical plants in kansas louisiana and new york and a group of oil and gas properties in the southwestern united states — accounted for 62 percent of the reserves associated with the occidentaloperated sites 

four other sites — a landfill in western new york former chemical plants in tennessee and delaware and a closed coal mine in pennsylvania — accounted for 63 percent of the reserves associated with closed or nonoperated occidental sites 

environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation the following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years 



based on current estimates occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four  years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10  or more years occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to 380 million see critical accounting policies and estimates — environmental liabilities and expenditures for additional information 

environmental costs 

occidental’s environmental costs some of which include estimates are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended december 31 



operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures relate to longerlived improvements in properties currently operated by occidental remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations 

occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately 160 million for 2015 

foreign investments 

many of occidental’s assets are located outside north america at december 31 2014  the carrying value of occidental’s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately 15 billion or approximately 27 percent of occidental’s total assets at that date of such assets approximately 13 billion are located in middle eastnorth africa and approximately 2 billion are located in latin america for the year ended december 31 2014  net sales outside north america totaled 73 billion or approximately 38 percent of total net sales 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires occidentals management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts there has been no material change to occidentals critical accounting policies over the past three years the selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve managements judgment 

oil and gas properties 

the carrying value of occidental’s ppe represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest net of accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization dda and any impairment charges for assets acquired ppe cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets 

occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found if proved reserves have been found the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized otherwise occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense in some cases a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells occidental generally expenses the costs of such 

 

exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12month period after drilling is complete 

occidental expenses annual lease rentals the costs of injectants used in production and geological geophysical and seismic costs as incurred 

occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unitofproduction method it amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 

several factors could change occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves for example occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices in other cases particularly with longlived properties lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical for such properties higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded in 2014  revisions of previous estimates caused a net 58 million boe decrease in proved reserves which amounted to approximately 2 percent of occidentals total reserves as of december 31 2014  

additionally occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable if there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices significant changes in reserve estimates changes in managements plans or other significant events management will evaluate the property for impairment under the successful efforts method if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment 

charge in the period individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows which is generally on a field by field basis the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants the impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time these assumptions include estimates of future product prices contractual prices estimates of riskadjusted proved oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs 

the most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in occidentals oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the dda rate for example a 5percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the dda rate by approximately 070 per barrel which would increase or decrease pretax income by approximately 155 million annually at current production rates the change in the dda rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial 

a portion of the carrying value of occidental’s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties at december 31 2014  the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were 20 billion the unproved amounts are not subject to dda until they are classified as proved properties capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to dda when proved reserves are assigned to the property if the exploration efforts are unsuccessful or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices higher development and operating costs contractual conditions or other factors the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed the timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties if warranted depends upon managements plans the nature timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance 

during its annual capital planning process in the fourth quarter of 2014 management determined that it would not pursue development of certain of its nonproducing domestic oil and gas acreage based on product prices availability of transportation capacity to market the products and regulatory and environmental considerations as a result occidental recorded pretax impairment charges of 14 billion for the acreage in addition during the second quarter of 2014 occidental recorded a pretax impairment charge of 471 million for domestic nonproducing acreage 

chemical assets 

occ identals chemical assets are depreciated using either the unitofproduction or the straightline method based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets which range from three years to 50 years are also used for impairment tests the estimated useful lives for the 

 

chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance as well as planned major maintenance activities pmma ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred pmma costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul additionally occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use these capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service the resulting revision if any of the asset’s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively 

without these continued expenditures the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition demand feedstock costs energy prices environmental regulations and technological changes 

occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

occidentals net ppe for the chemical segment is approximately 26 billion and its depreciation expense for 2015 is expected to be approximately 310 million the most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical plants would be on depreciation expense for example a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pretax earnin gs by approximately 50 million per year 

midstream marketing and other assets 

derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cashflow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment otherwise any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period for cashflow hedges the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income oci with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged realized gains or losses from cashflow hedges and any ineffective portion are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location quality grade or changes in the expected quantity of the 

hedged item gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income there were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended december 31 2014  2013 and 2012 

a hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if at inception and throughout its life it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows respectively of the hedging instrument in the case of hedging a forecast transaction the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable 

occidentals midstream and marketing ppe is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using either the unitofproduction or straightline method occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

fair value measurements 

occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a threelevel fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation techniques level 1 – using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities level 2 – using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities and level 3 – using unobservable inputs transfers between levels if any are recognized at the end of each reporting period 

fair values  recurring 

occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs occidental utilizes the midpoint between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value in addition to using market data occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique for assets and liabilities carried at fair value occidental measures fair value using the following methods 



 

models that consider various inputs including quoted forward prices for commodities time value volatility factors credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments as well as other relevant economic measures substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 

 

occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a marketobservable price for an identical or similar asset or liability this approach utilizes managements judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows and discounts those cash flows using a riskadjusted discount rate 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience remedial objectives available technologies applicable laws and regulations and costsharing arrangements occidental bases environmental reserves on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred using the most costeffective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established the reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established the amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received or when receipt of recovery is highly probable as of december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  occidental did not have any accruals for reimbursements or recoveries 

many factors could affect occidental’s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses the most significant are 1 cost 

estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate 2 the length of time type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination 3 a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify occidental’s proposed remedial plan 4 improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs 5 laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability and 6 changes in allocation or costsharing arrangements may occur 

certain sites involve multiple parties with various costsharing arrangements which fall into the following three categories 1 environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties 2 oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest or 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of properties in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs in these circumstances occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate when estimating occidentals ultimate share of liability occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and based on these factors believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved 

in addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures which often take in excess of 10 years at npl sites occidentals reserves include managements estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly 

if occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings for example if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent occidental would record a pretax gain of 33 million if the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 33 million 

other loss contingencies 

occidental is involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings and audits occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis 

 

loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate management’s judgments could change based on new information changes in or interpretations of laws or regulations changes in management’s plans or intentions opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings or other factors see lawsuits claims and contingencies for additional information 

significant accounting and disclosure changes 

listed below are significant recently adopted accounting and disclosure changes 

in january 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued rules which eliminate from gaap the concept of extraordinary item the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring the rules are not expected to have an impact on occidental’s financial statements upon adoption 

in june 2014 the fasb issued rules affecting entities that grant their employees sharebased payment awards in which the terms of the awards provide that a performance target can be achieved after the requisite service period the new rules require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition entities may apply the update either a prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or b retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter these rules are effective for annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2015 the rules are not expected to have a material impact on occidentals financial statements upon adoption but will require assessment on an ongoing basis 

in may 2014 the fasb issued rules relating to revenue recognition under the new rules an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services the rules also require more detailed disclosures related to the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers these rules are effective for the company for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 the rules are not expected to have a material impact on occidentals financial statements upon adoption 

in april 2014 the fasb issued rules changing the requirements for reporting discontinued operations so that only the disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results will be reported as discontinued operations in the financial statements these rules are effective for annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2014 the rules are not expected to have a material impact on occidentals financial statements upon adoption 

in july 2013 the fasb issued rules requiring net rather than gross presentation of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss or other tax credit and any related liability for unrecognized tax benefits the rules became effective on january 1 2014 and did not have a material impact on occidentals financial statements 

safe harbor discussion regarding outlook and other forwardlooking data 

portions of this report including items 1 and 2 business and properties item 3 legal proceedings item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations liquidity cash flows and business prospects words such as estimate project predict will would should could may might anticipate plan intend believe expect aim goal target objective likely or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes generally indicate forwardlooking statements you should not place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date of this report unless legally required occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise factors that may cause occidental’s results of operations and financial position to differ from expectations include the factors discussed in item 1a risk factors and elsewhere 




 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

general 

occidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil ngls and natural gas prices price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect occidental’s pretax annual income by approximately 126 million for a 1 per barrel change in oil prices and 27 million for a 1 per barrel change in ngls prices if domestic natural gas prices varied by 050 per mcf it would have an estimated annual effect on occidentals pretax income of approximately 50 million these pricechange sensitivities include the impact of psc and similar contract volume changes on income if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidental’s results to prices also will change the marketing and trading results are sensitive to price changes of oil gas and to a lesser degree other commodities these sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing and trading volumes and cannot be predicted reliably 

 

occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices a variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of 10 per ton would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 10 million and 30 million respectively a variation in pvc prices of 001  per lb would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 25 million historically over time product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins according to ihs chemical december 2014 average contract prices were chlorine—233 per ton caustic soda—590 per ton and pvc—067 per lb 

occidental uses derivative instruments including a combination of shortterm futures forwards options and swaps to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas occidental only occasionally hedges its oil and gas production and when it does so the volumes are usually insignificant 

risk management 

occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy the controls under this policy are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which manages risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check members of the risk management group report to the corporate vice president and treasurer the president and chief executive officer and executive vice president of operations also oversee these controls controls for these activities include limits on value at risk limits on credit limits on total notional trade value segregation of duties delegation of authority daily price verifications daily reporting to senior management of positions together with various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls additionally these operations maintain highly liquid positions as a result of which the market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice 

fair value of marketing and trading derivative contracts 

occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing and trading activities at fair value fair values for these contracts are derived principally from level 1 and level 2 sources 

the following table shows the fair value of occidentals derivatives excluding collateral segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation

occidental’s marketing and trading operations from time to time store natural gas purchased from third parties at occidental’s north american leased storage facilities derivative instruments used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes ended march 31 2014 as of december 31 2014  occidental did not have any cashflow hedges on stored volumes of natural gas at december 31 2013  occidental had approximately 11 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage and had cashflow hedges for the forecast sale to be settled by physical delivery of approximately 13 billion cubic feet of stored natural gas 

quantitative information 

occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commoditybased and foreign currency derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities this method determines the maximum potential negative shortterm change in fair value with at least a 95percent level of confidence additionally occidental uses trading limits including among others limits on total notional trade value and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice as a result of these controls occidental has determined that the market risk of the marketing and trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its operations 

interest rate risk 

general 

occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variablerate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2014  variablerate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of occidentals total debt

credit risk 

occidentals credit risk relates primarily to its derivative financial instruments and trade receivables occidental’s contracts are spread among a large number of counterparties creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances current activity and forward marktomarket exposure 

a majority of occidental’s derivative transaction volumes are executed through exchangetraded contracts which are subject to nominal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions is settled on a daily margin basis with select clearinghouses and brokers occidental executes the rest of its derivative transactions in the otc market occidental is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong by spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties by entering into master netting arrangements with the counterparties and by requiring collateral as appropriate occidental actively monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and records valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty risk if necessary 

certain of occidentals otc derivative instruments contain creditriskcontingent features primarily tied to credit ratings for occidental or its counterparties which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post as of december 31 2014  and 2013  occidental had a net liability of 4 million and 8 million respectively which are net of collateral posted of 3 million and 23 million respectively occidental believes that if it had received a onenotch reduction in its credit ratings it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateralposting requirements as of december 31 2014  and 2013  

as of december 31 2014  the substantial majority of the credit exposures was with investment grade counterparties occidental believes its exposure to creditrelated losses at december 31 2014  was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented 

foreign currency risk 

occidental’s foreign operations have limited currency risk occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes a vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in united states dollars additionally all of occidental’s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the united states dollar as the functional currency as of december 31 2014  the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the trading operations was immaterial the effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income

occidental makes the following information available free of charge on its website at wwwoxycom 

 information contained on occidentals website is not part of this report 




 item 1a risk factors 

volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affects occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products particularly oil and to a lesser extent natural gas and ngls and its chemical products 

changes in consumption patterns global and local particularly for gas economic conditions inventory levels production disruptions the actions of opec currency exchange rates worldwide drilling and exploration activities technological developments weather geophysical and technical limitations transportation bottlenecks and other matters affect the supply and demand dynamics of oil gas and ngls which along with the effect of changes in market perceptions contribute to price unpredictability and volatility 

the prices obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the united states and global economies as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

occidentals potential restructuring activities may affect its stock price 

occidental has disclosed that it is performing a strategic review of its operations which may result in a restructuring of its business activities the outcome of this activity may affect the market value of occidentals common stock for example occidental may take different 

 

actions than expected receive less proceeds or retain more liabilities than anticipated in connection with any divestitures additionally the restructuring activity may be viewed negatively by the market and result in a stock price drop 

occidental may experience delays cost overruns losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities 

occidental bears the risks of equipment failures construction delays escalating costs or competition for services materials supplies or labor property or border disputes disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns 

exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses 

governmental actions and political instability may affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s businesses are subject to the decisions of many federal state local and foreign governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 

 occidental may experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its international operations are located in countries occasionally affected by political instability nationalizations corruption armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources 

occidentals oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its ability to make acquisitions to grow production and replace reserves 

results of operations reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend in part on occidental’s ability to profitably acquire additional reserves occidental has many competitors including national oil companies some of which i are larger and better funded ii may be willing to accept greater risks or iii have special competencies competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts in addition during periods of low product prices any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts 

occidental’s acquisition activities also carry risks that it may i not fully realize anticipated benefits due to lessthanexpected reserves or production or changed circumstances such as the deterioration of natural gas prices in recent years ii bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties iii experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity or iv assume liabilities that are greater than anticipated 

occidental’s oil and gas reserves are based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability including production decline rates operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices as well as capital and operating costs if occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected 

concerns about climate change may affect occidental’s operations 

the us federal government and the state of california have adopted and other jurisdictions are considering legislation regulations or policies that seek to control or reduce the production use or emissions of “greenhouse gases” ghg to control or reduce the production or consumption of fossil fuels and to increase the use of renewable or alternative energy sources for example california’s ghg capandtrade program currently applies to occidentals operations in the state the us environmental protection agency has begun to regulate certain ghg emissions from both stationary and mobile sources the uncertain outcome and timing of existing and proposed international national and state measures make it difficult to predict their business impact however occidental could face risks of project execution increased costs and taxes and lower demand for and restrictions or prohibition on the use of its products as a result of ongoing ghg reduction efforts 

 

occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic events 

the occurrence of events such as earthquakes hurricanes floods droughts well blowouts fires explosions chemical releases industrial accidents physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses 

cyber attacks could significantly affect occidental 

cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years occidental relies on electronic systems and networks to control and manage its oil and gas chemicals trading and pipeline operations and has multiple layers of security to mitigate risks of cyber attack if however occidental were to experience an attack and its security measures failed the potential consequences to its businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant 

occidentals oil and gas reserve additions may not continue at the same rate and its measure of full cycle cash margin may not be fully comparable to that of other companies 

management expects improved recovery extensions and discoveries to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors such as geology government regulations and permits and the effectiveness of development plans are partially or fully outside managements control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations occidental uses a measure referred to as full cycle cash margin to measure its performance in developing reserves at a profitable cost the measure may not include all the costs associated with exploration and development related to reserves added for the period or may include costs related to reserves added or to be added in other periods and may differ from the calculations used by other companies

strategy 

general 

through its operations occidental aims to maximize total returns to stockholders using the following strategies 

 in conducting its business occidental accepts commodity engineering and limited exploration risks occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks 

to maximize returns occidental from time to time reviews its business strategy in october 2013 and february 2014 occidental’s board of directors authorized several actions resulting from a strategic review to streamline and focus operations in order to better execute occidental’s longterm strategy and enhance value for shareholders the authorized actions included 

 with respect to these initiatives since october occidental 

 the strategic review underway is expected to result in significant changes to occidental’s asset mix occidentals capital program production expectations and other elements of its future plans will be adjusted as related transactions are concluded proceeds resulting from these actions will largely be used to reduce occidentals capitalization in the fourth quarter of 2013 occidental bought back almost 10 million shares of its own stock for approximately 09 billion using the proceeds from the 

 

plains pipeline sale occidental also retired 06 billion of its debt in the fourth quarter 

occidental prioritizes the use of its operating cash flows in the following order 

 capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner management aims to develop occidentals assets in a manner that would contribute substantially to earnings and cash flow after invested capital the following describes the application of occidentals overall strategy to each of its operating segments 

oil and gas 

segment earnings 

 millions 

occidental prefers to hold large longlived legacy oil and gas assets like those in california and the permian basin that tend to have enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to costeffective production occidental also focuses a growing portion of its drilling activities on unconventional shale opportunities 

the oil and gas business seeks to increase its oil and gas production profitably and add new reserves at a pace ahead of production while minimizing costs incurred for finding and development of such reserves the oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by 



 over the past several years occidental built a large portfolio of growthoriented assets in the united states in 2013 occidental spent a much larger portion of its investment capital on the development of this portfolio acquisitions in 2013 were at a multiyear low of approximately 05 billion all for domestic oil and gas properties compared to recent years this reduced acquisition activity reflects occidentals strategy to capitalize on the opportunities presented by its existing portfolio of assets 

management currently believes occidentals oil and gas segment growth will come domestically from higher oil production in california and the permian basin and internationally from opportunities in key assets mainly in oman and qatar as well as the completion of the al hosn gas project in late 2014 

chemical 

segment earnings 

 millions 

the primary objective of the chemical business oxychem is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve abovecostofcapital returns the chemical segments strategy is to be a lowcost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine which is coproduced with caustic soda and markets both to third parties in addition chlorine together with ethylene is converted through a series of intermediate products into pvc oxychems focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to 

 

focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chloralkali and pvc businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities oxychem expects to begin operating the new johnsonville tennessee chloralkali facility in early 2014 during the second quarter of 2013 occidental sold its investment in carbocloro a brazilian joint venture for a pretax gain of 131 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 oxychem and mexichem sab de cv formed a 5050 joint venture to construct and operate a 12billionpound per year capacity ethylene cracker with startup expected in 2017 and entered into related supply agreements 

midstream and marketing 

segment earnings 

 millions 

the midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing use of its assets including its transportation and storage capacity and by providing access to multiple markets in order to generate returns the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to other occidental segments as well as third parties in commodities trading occidental seeks to generate gains using netlong positions the segment invests in and operates gas plants cogeneration facilities pipeline systems and storage facilities the segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas power and other commodities used in occidentals businesses and to limit credit risk exposure capital is employed to sustain or where appropriate increase operational and transportation capacity and to improve the competitiveness of occidentals assets occidental and magellan midstream partners lp magellan are proceeding with the construction of the bridgetex pipeline which will transport crude oil between the permian region and the gulf coast refinery markets and is expected to begin service in mid2014 in 2013 occidental completed the sale of a portion of its investment in plains pipeline resulting in a 10 billion pretax gain 

key performance indicators 

general 

occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return in addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics 

 occidental also monitors other segmentspecific indicators such as perunit profit production costs and finding and development costs as well as health environmental and safety measures such as the number of recordable injuries and others 

based on the 288 per share annual dividend rate announced in february 2014  occidental’s dividend rate has increased by 476 percent since 2002 while its stockholders equity increased by 8 percent for 2013  and 34 percent for the threeyear period from 2011 through 2013  occidental continued to deliver abovecostofcapital returns as follows 



 

 

 

debt structure 

in 2013 occidental decreased its debt balance by 690 million which reduced its debttocapitalization debt and equity ratio from 16 percent at yearend 2012 to 14 percent at yearend 2013 

oil and gas segment 

business environment 

oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s short and intermediateterm financial performance the following table presents the average daily west texas intermediate wti brent and new york mercantile exchange nymex prices for 2013  and 2012  



the following table presents occidentals average realized prices as a percentage of wti brent and nymex for 2013  and 2012  



average worldwide realized oil prices were flat in 2013 compared to 2012 approximately 60 percent of occidental’s oil production tracks world oil prices such as brent and 40 percent tracks wti the average realized domestic natural gas price in 2013  increased 29 percent from 2012  

prices and differentials can vary significantly even on a shortterm basis making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty 

operations 

domestic interests 

occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns occidentals domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years which is extended through the end of production once it commences of the total 82 million net acres in which occidental has interests approximately 74 percent is leased 25 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights 

productionsharing contracts psc 

occidental has interests that are operated under pscs or similar contracts in bahrain iraq libya oman qatar and yemen under such contracts occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain production costs and an additional share for profit in addition occidentals share of production and reserves from operations in long beach california and certain contracts in colombia are subject to contractual 

arrangements similar to a psc these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher

permian basin 

occidentals permian basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas the basin extends throughout southwest texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states accounting for approximately 15 percent of the total united states oil production occidental 

 

is the largest operator and the largest producer of oil in the permian basin with an approximate 15 percent net share of the total oil production in the basin occidental also produces and processes natural gas and ngls in the basin 

occidental manages its permian basin operations through two business units permian eor enhanced oil recovery which includes co 2  and waterfloods and permian resources which includes growthoriented unconventional opportunities during 2013 capital efficiency efforts reduced drilling costs per well by 25 percent for the permian basin operations while operating expenses decreased by 322 per barrel or 17 percent in addition management began transitioning to a horizontal drilling program to take advantage of unconventional and shale opportunities in the permian basin occidental spent over 17 billion of capital in 2013 with 64 percent spent on permian resources assets in 2014 permian basin capital spending is expected to be slightly less than 22 billion the entire 450 million increase will be spent on permian resources assets and will focus on growing oil production approximately 70 percent of the total capital to be spent in the permian basin will be for permian resources assets 

occidentals permian resources operations are among its fastestgrowing assets and held approximately 19 million net acres at the end of 2013 including acreage with prospective resource potential the development program largely begun in 2010 continued to increase in 2013 accounting for more than 285 wells drilled in 2013 permian resources drilled 49 horizontal wells and expects this to increase in 2014 to approximately 172 of its 345 total planned wells production from this business unit comes from approximately 9500 gross wells of which 54 percent are operated by other producers on a net basis this represents approximately 4400 wells of which only 15 percent are operated by others 

the permian eor business unit operates a combination of co 2  and waterfloods which have similar development characteristics and ongoing monitoring and maintenance requirements approximately 74 percent of occidental’s permian eor oil production is from fields that actively employ co 2  flood technology an enhanced oil recovery technique these co 2  flood operations make occidental a world leader in the application of this technology occidental believes it has the ability to accelerate growth in the permian eor projects as more co 2  becomes available over the past several years occidental has focused more capital on waterfloods than co 2  developments of the 660 million in capital spending permian eor plans for 2014 25 percent will be used for current waterflood development and the remainder for co2 floods 

occidentals share of production in the permian basin was approximately 212000 boe per day in 2013  

california 

occidentals california operations include interests in the san joaquin valley the wilmington and other fields in the los angeles basin and the ventura and sacramento basins occidental is californias largest producer of natural gas and the largest oil and gas producer on a gross 

operatedboe basis and has properties in approximately 130 fields occidental manages its california operations through separate teams focused on waterfloods steam floods for heavy oil resources and unconventional and other developing plays 

the main california objectives in 2013 were to deliver a predictable outcome advance lowrisk projects that contribute to longterm growth reduce the cost structure lower the base decline create a more balanced portfolio and test exploration and development concepts occidental believes it achieved all of these objectives in 2013 notably progressing the development of its multiyear steam floods in kern front and lost hills bringing its huntington beach field waterflood redevelopment online further developing its wilmington field improving capital efficiency by 20 percent and reducing operating costs by 470 per boe or 20 percent 

occidental increased the 2013 oil development capital spending to almost 90 percent of the total capital for california of the 15 billion of capital spent in 2013 39 percent was for waterfloods 22 percent for steam floods and 39 percent for unconventional and other developing plays the 2014 program will continue efforts in each of these areas with increased efforts in horizontal wells in occidentals waterfloods new pilot projects in its steam floods and increased unconventional drilling the allocation for the 19 billion 2014 capital program is expected to be similar to 2013 the 2014 capital strategy is to continue focusing the majority of capital spending on projects identified as lowdecline lowrisk and highreturn that are expected to provide longterm growth and capitalize on recent exploration successes occidental drilled approximately 770 wells in california during 2013 and plans to drill approximately 1050 wells in 2014 including 175 waterflood wells in the la basin 420 wells for steam floods and 130 unconventional shale wells at elk hills 

over the next several years there will be some rebalancing between highdecline such as elk hills and lowdecline assets with the higher investments in water and steam floods production from these fields is expected to grow faster the investments being made in highdecline assets are expected to moderate their decline as a result the balance of assets in the california portfolio is expected to shift towards lowdecline assets over time 

in addition occidental holds more than 23 million net acres in california the large majority of which are net fee mineral interests as a result occidental has a substantial inventory of properties available for future development and exploitation opportunities currently approximately onethird of california production is from unconventional reservoirs and occidental holds more than 11 million net acres for such resources    occidentals share of production in california was approximately 154000 boe per day in 2013  

  

midcontinent and other 

the midcontinent and other properties include interests in the hugoton field the piceance basin the williston basin and the eagle ford shale and other areas in south texas these properties are located in kansas 

 

oklahoma colorado north dakota and texas occidental holds over 23 million net acres in the midcontinent region which includes 14 million net acres in a large concentration of gas reserves and production and royalty interests in the hugoton area and approximately 168000 net acres in the piceance area occidental also holds approximately 176000 net acres in south texas including 4000 net acres in the eagle ford shale in addition occidental holds approximately 335000 net acres of oilproducing and unconventional properties in the williston basins bakken three forks and pronghorn formations 

in midcontinent and other occidental drilled approximately 175 wells and produced approximately 108000 boe per day in 2013  

other developments 

during its annual capital planning process in the fourth quarter of 2013 management determined that it would not pursue development of certain of its nonproducing domestic oil and gas acreage based on product prices availability of transportation capacity to market the products and regulatory and environmental considerations as a result occidental recorded pretax impairment charges of 06 billion for the acreage

bahrain 

in 2009 occidental and other consortium members began operating the bahrain field under a 20year development and production sharing agreement dpsa occidental has a 48percent working interest in the joint venture since handover of operations the consortium has increased gross gas production capacity more than 50 percent from an initial level of 15 billion cubic feet per day to over 23 billion cubic feet per day and increased gross oil production from 26000 barrels per day to 44000 barrels per day occidentals share of production from bahrain during 2013  was approximately 241 million cubic feet mmcf per day of gas and 3000 barrels of oil per day 

iraq 

in 2010 occidental and other consortium members signed a 20year contract with the south oil company of iraq to develop the zubair field in 2013 the terms were improved reflecting a reduction in the targeted production level to 850000 boe per day and a fiveyear extension to 2035 occidentals interest in this contract entitles occidental to receive oil for cost recovery and a remuneration fee past delays in development plans have limited the amount of production from iraq occidental does not know when development activities will reach desired levels occidentals share of production from iraq was approximately 17000 boe per day in 2013  

libya 

occidental participates with the libyan national oil company in the sirte basin producing operations these agreements continue through 2032 in 2013 production was disrupted for a significant portion of the year due to field and port strikes occidental does not know when operations will return to normal levels the 2013 production volume was approximately 7000 boe per day 

oman 

in oman occidental is the operator of block 9 and block 27 with a 65percent working interest in each block block 53 with a 45percent working interest and block 62 with a 48percent working interest 

a 30year psc for the mukhaizna field block 53 was signed with the government of oman in 2005 pursuant to which occidental assumed operation of the field by the end of 2013  occidental had drilled more than 2100 new wells and continued implementation of a major steamflood project in 2013  the average gross daily production was 123000 boe per day which was over 15 times higher than the production rate in september 2005 when occidental assumed operations 

the term for block 9 continues through december 2015 with a 10year extension right for certain areas subject to government approval the term for block 27 expires in 2035 

in 2008 occidental was awarded a 20year contract for block 62 subject to declaration of commerciality where it is pursuing development and exploration opportunities targeting gas and condensate resources 

occidentals share of production from oman was approximately 74000 boe per day in 2013  

qatar 

in qatar occidental is the operator at idd el shargi north dome isnd and idd el shargi south dome issd with a 100percent working interest in each and al rayyan block 12 with a 925percent working interest the terms for isnd issd and block 12 expire in 2019 2022 and 2017 respectively 

 

in 2013 occidental received approval from the government of qatar for the fifth phase of field development of the isnd field intended to improve the ultimate recovery in all existing contract reservoirs by drilling over 200 additional production water injection and water source wells and installing associated facilities required to support the additional wells occidentals aggregate investment is expected to exceed 3 billion through 2019 with the goal of sustaining gross oil production levels at approximately 100000 barrels per day during that period 

occidentals dolphin investment comprises two separate economic interests through which occidental owns i a 245percent undivided interest in the upstream operations under a dpsa with the government of qatar to develop and produce natural gas and ngls in qatar’s north field through mid2032 with a provision to request a fiveyear extension and ii a 245percent interest in the stock of dolphin energy limited dolphin energy which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in midstream and marketing segment – pipeline transportation 

occidentals share of production from qatar was approximately 105000 boe per day in 2013  

united arab emirates 

in 2011 occidental acquired a 40percent participating interest in the al hosn gas project joining with the abu dhabi national oil company adnoc in a 30year joint venture agreement once fully operational the project is anticipated to produce over 500 mmcf per day of natural gas of which occidental’s net share would be over 200 mmcf per day in addition the project is expected to produce over 50000 barrels per day of ngls and condensate of which occidental’s net share would be over 20000 barrels per day occidental’s 2013  capital expenditures for this project were approximately 950 million a substantial portion of the total expenditures to date has been incurred in connection with plants and facilities and is included in the midstream and marketing segment occidental believes that its share of total 2014 capital for the project will be approximately 760 million initial production from this project is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2014 

occidental conducts a majority of its middle east business development activities through its office in abu dhabi which also provides various support functions for occidental’s middle eastnorth africa oil and gas operations 

yemen 

in yemen occidental owns interests in block 10 east shabwa field which extends through 2015 with a 404percent interest that includes an 118percent interest held in an unconsolidated entity and block s1 an nagyah field which is an occidentaloperated block with a 75percent working interest that extends into 2023 

occidentals share of production from the yemen properties was approximately 12000 boe per day in 2013  

latin america assets 



bolivia 

occidental holds working interests in the tarija chuquisaca and santa cruz regions of bolivia which produce gas 

colombia 

occidental has a working interest in the la cirainfantas area and has operations within the llanos norte basin occidentals interests range from 39 to 61 percent and certain interests expire between 2023 and 2030 while others extend through the economic limit of the areas occidentals share of production was approximately 29000 boe per day in 2013 

proved reserves 

proved oil ngl and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements oil ngl and gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity quality and transportation costs for the 2013  2012  and 2011  disclosures the calculated average west texas intermediate oil prices were 9694 9471 and 9619 per barrel respectively the calculated average henry hub gas prices for 2013  2012  and 2011  disclosures were 365 279 and 404 per mmbtu respectively 

occidental had proved reserves at yearend 2013  of 3483 million boe compared to the yearend 2012  amount of 3296 million boe proved reserves at yearend 2013  and 2012  consisted of respectively 62 percent oil each year 12 percent and 10 percent ngls and 26 percent and 28 percent natural gas proved developed reserves represented approximately 70 percent and 73 percent respectively of occidental’s total proved reserves at yearend 2013  and 2012  a substantial portion of the proved undeveloped pud reserves as of december 31 2013 as well as the increase in the share of puds in 2013 compared to 2012 was the result of puds from the al hosn gas project reserves which represented 27 percent of total yearend 

 

puds occidental expects to transfer a substantial portion of these reserves to the proved developed category at the end of 2014 when additional wells are drilled and initial production begins in the fourth quarter 

occidental does not have any reserves from nontraditional sources for further information regarding occidentals proved reserves see supplemental oil and gas information following the financial statements 

proved reserve additions 

occidentals total proved reserve additions from all sources were 470 million boe in 2013  over 90 percent of these reserve additions were the result of occidentals development program 

the total additions were as follows 



occidentals ability to add reserves other than through purchases depends on the success of improved recovery extension and discovery projects each of which depends on reservoir characteristics technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices as well as capital and operating costs many of these factors are outside management’s control and will affect whether these historical sources of proved reserve additions continue at similar levels occidentals 2013 development program provided approximately 291 million boe of reserve additions domestically 

improved recovery 

in 2013  occidental added proved reserves of 348 million boe from improved recovery through its eor and infill drilling activities generally the improved recovery additions in 2013  were associated with the continued development of properties in permian basin california williston basin qatar and oman these properties comprise both conventional projects which are characterized by the deployment of eor development methods largely employing application of co 2  waterflood or steam flood and unconventional projects these types of conventional eor development methods can be applied through existing wells though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells the use of either co 2  or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation the evaluation of engineering data availability and cost of either co 2  or steam and other economic factors both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells many of occidentals projects including unconventional projects rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells in addition some improved recovery comes from drilling infill 

wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells 

extensions and discoveries 

occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs in 2013  extensions and discoveries added 81 million boe substantially all of which is attributable to the recognition of proved undeveloped reserves from the al hosn gas project 

purchases of proved reserves 

occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable as market conditions change the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly in 2013  occidental added 37 million boe through purchases of proved reserves largely consisting of several domestic acquisitions in the permian basin 

revisions of previous estimates 

revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic production decline or operating performance data in addition product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental for example higher prices may increase the economically recoverable reserves particularly for domestic properties because the extra margin extends the expected life of the operations offsetting this effect higher prices decrease occidentals share of proved reserves under pscs because less oil is required to recover costs conversely when prices drop occidentals share of proved reserves increases for pscs and economically recoverable reserves may drop for other operations in 2013  revisions of previous estimates provided an increase of 4 million boe to proved reserves 

reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data as a result apart from the effect of product prices it is generally more likely that future proved reserve revisions will be positive in aggregate over time rather than negative 

proved undeveloped reserves 

in 2013  occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 363 million boe from improved recovery extensions and discoveries and purchases of the total additions 270 million boe represented additions from improved recovery primarily in permian basin california williston basin and internationally in qatar and oman occidental added 15 million boe through purchases of proved undeveloped reserves domestically in the permian basin additionally the proved undeveloped reserves increased due to extensions and discoveries mainly from the al hosn gas project these proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by transfers of 150 million boe to the proved developed category as a result of the 2013  development programs occidental incurred 

 

approximately 27 billion in 2013  to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves permian basin california oman williston basin and south texas accounted for approximately 88 percent of the reserve transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2013  while costs to develop proved undeveloped reserves have generally increased over time in 2013 domestic development costs per barrel decreased by 25 percent as a result of the capital efficiency initiatives a substantial portion of the puds as of december 31 2013 as well as the increase in the share of puds in 2013 compared to 2012 was the result of puds from the al hosn gas project reserves which represented 27 percent of total yearend proved undeveloped reserves occidental expects to transfer a substantial portion of these reserves to the proved developed category at the end of 2014 when additional wells are drilled and initial production begins in the fourth quarter 

reserves evaluation and review process 

occidental’s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of december 31 2013  were made by occidental’s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management the estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by occidental to develop the reserves this process involves reservoir engineers geoscientists planning engineers and financial analysts as part of the proved reserves estimation process all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates operating costs and capital expenditures price differentials between benchmark prices the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods including estimates from decline curve analysis typecurve analysis material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance these fieldtested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities 

net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 

the current senior vice president reserves for oxy oil and gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates in compliance with us securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations 

including the internal audit and review of occidentals oil and gas reserves data the senior vice president has over 30 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business and has held various assignments in north america asia and europe he is a threetime past chair of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee he is an american association of petroleum geologists aapg certified petroleum geologist and currently serves on the aapg committee on resource evaluation he is a member of the society of petroleum evaluation engineers the colorado school of mines potential gas committee and the unece expert group on resource classification he is also an active member of the joint committee on reserves evaluator training jcoret the senior vice president has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in geology from emory university in atlanta 

occidental has a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee consisting of senior corporate officers to review and approve occidentals oil and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidentals board of directors during the year since 2003 occidental has retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum engineering consultants to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes 

in 2013 ryder scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of december 31 2013  in accordance with the sec regulatory standards ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of occidental’s 2013  yearend total proved reserves portfolio in 2013  ryder scott reviewed approximately 21 percent of occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves since being engaged in 2003 ryder scott has reviewed the specific application of occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 71 percent of occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves management retains ryder scott to provide objective thirdparty input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by occidental occidental has filed ryder scotts independent report as an exhibit to this form 10k 

based on its reviews including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current sec regulations 

 

industry outlook 

the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous current and anticipated market conditions the wti and brent oil price indexes fluctuated throughout 2013  settling at 9842 per barrel and 11080 per barrel respectively as of december 31 2013  

oil prices will continue to be affected by i global supply and demand which are generally a function of global economic conditions inventory levels production disruptions technological advances regional market conditions and the actions of opec other significant producers and governments ii transportation capacity and cost in producing areas iii currency exchange rates and iv the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions 

ngl prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock in addition infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region 

domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas 

these and other factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil ngl and domestic gas prices reliably international gas prices are generally fixed under longterm contracts occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital 

chemical segment 

business environment 

the modest pace of united states economic growth resulted in higher demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks resulting in higher raw material prices though this did not have the same effect on all product prices chemical segment earnings excluding the gain on sale of the carbocloro investment decreased in 2013 primarily due to higher energy and ethylene costs and lower chloralkali and chlorinated organics pricing driven by continued unfavorable supply and demand fundamentals 

business review 

basic chemicals 

during 2013 the modest pace of the united states economic growth much of the year resulted in lackluster domestic demand and pricing for basic chemical products industry chlorine operating rates remained relatively flat with 2012 at approximately 84 percent preventing chlorine price improvement and prices ended approximately 4 percent below where they began exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain remained competitive as a result of the north american feedstock cost advantages which are driven mostly by natural gas prices liquid caustic soda prices fell over the last two 

quarters of 2013 and were slightly below the prior year levels for the whole year in the domestic market anticipation of additional capacity coming online in early 2014 from the commissioning of three additional chloralkali plants including oxychem’s 182500tonperyear membrane plant in tennessee created downward pressure on liquid caustic soda prices during the second half of 2013 export demand and pricing for liquid caustic soda was negatively impacted in mid2013 by operational issues at a large latin american alumina producer businesses such as calcium chloride and potassium hydroxide improved compared to 2012 as domestic demand improved and margins remained stable throughout the year 

vinyls 

yearoveryear domestic demand grew by more than 4 percent on the strength of the housing and commercial construction markets this was offset by a decrease in exports resulting in no change in industry operating rates in 2013 compared to 2012 industry margins increased in 2013 due to higher pvc selling prices partially offset by higher ethylene costs north american ethanebased ethylene continues to be costcompetitive versus prices in europe and asia giving north american vinyl products an advantage in global markets despite the yearoveryear reduction in north american exports of pvc export volumes represented nearly 35 percent of total pvc sales of north american producers 

  

industry outlook 

industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy specifically in the housing construction automotive and durable goods markets margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices 

basic chemicals 

occidental expects that if the united states housing automotive and durable goods markets continue to improve domestic demand for basic chemical products should be higher in 2014 however with forecasted capacity additions significantly exceeding closures industry operating rates are expected to decline in 2014 resulting in increased competitive activity overall improved demand in the face of increased capacity is anticipated to provide similar margins in 2014 for chlorine and caustic soda compared to 2013 levels the continued competitiveness of downstream chlorine derivatives in global markets is contingent on united states feedstock costs primarily natural gas and ethylene remaining favorable compared to other global markets 

vinyls 

north american demand and operating rates should improve in 2014 if growth in both housing starts and commercial construction continues occidental expects export demand to remain firm and margins to improve over 2013 

 

midstream and marketing segment 

business environment 

midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing and trading businesses and its processing transportation and power generation assets the marketing and trading businesses aggregate and market occidentals and thirdparty volumes trade commodities and engage in storage activities marketing and trading performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segments plants and pipelines as well as the margins obtained on related services 

the midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2013  excluding the gain from the sale of a portion of an investment in plains pipeline were greater than 2012 reflecting higher earnings in the pipeline and power generation businesses and improved marketing and trading performance these improvements were partially offset by lower income in the gas processing business due in part to plant turnarounds in the permian basin operations 

business review 

marketing and trading 

the marketing and trading group markets substantially all of occidental’s oil ngls and gas production trades around its assets including transportation and storage capacity and engages in commodities trading occidental’s thirdparty marketing and trading activities focus on purchasing oil ngls and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets these purchases allow occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets in addition occidental’s phibro trading units strategy is to profit from market price changes marketing performance improved mainly as a result of capturing regional crude price differentials by utilizing new pipelines providing access to the gulf coast refineries 

gas processing plants and co 2  fields and facilities 

occidental processes its and thirdparty domestic wet gas to extract ngls and other gas byproducts including co 2  and delivers dry gas to pipelines margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for ngls occidental’s 2013  earnings from these operations decreased compared to 2012  which reflected lower ngl prices and plant turnarounds in the permian basin operations 

occidental together with adnoc is constructing a gas plant and facilities as part of the al hosn gas project in abu dhabi the gas plant and facilities are expected to be completed and become operational in late 2014 

pipeline transportation 

margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped dolphin energy owns and operates a 230milelong 48inchdiameter natural gas pipeline dolphin pipeline which transports dry natural gas from qatar to the uae and oman the dolphin pipeline contributes significantly to occidentals pipeline transportation results through occidentals 245percent interest in dolphin energy the dolphin pipeline has capacity to transport up to 32 bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 23 bcf per day dolphin pipeline is currently expanding gas compression facilities to achieve maximum pipeline capacity occidental believes substantial opportunities remain to provide gas transportation to additional customers in the region to reach the full capacity of the dolphin pipeline and generate additional midstream revenues and cash flows 

occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2800 miles of pipelines from southeast new mexico across the permian basin of southwest texas to cushing oklahoma the system has a current throughput capacity of about 616000 barrels per day 58 million barrels of active storage capability and 95 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline 

following the fourth quarter 2013 sale of a portion of its investment occidental owns approximately 25 percent of plains pipeline a publiclytraded oil and gas pipeline transportation storage terminalling and marketing entity operating in canada and the western and southern united states the plains pipeline investment contributed over 25 percent of the segments earnings for 2013 excluding the gain from the sale 

occidental and magellan are proceeding with construction of the bridgetex pipeline which is expected to begin service in mid2014 the approximately 450milelong pipeline will be capable of transporting approximately 300000 barrels per day of crude oil between the permian region colorado city texas and gulf coast refinery markets the bridgetex pipeline project also includes construction of approximately 26 million barrels of oil storage in aggregate 

occidentals 2013 pipeline transportation earnings improved due to higher volumes and pricing and higher income from plains pipeline and the dolphin pipeline 

 

power generation facilities 

earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties and are generally not material 

  

industry outlook 

the pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable the gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending mostly on ngl prices which cannot be predicted generally higher ngl prices result in higher profitability although the marketing and the trading businesses individually can be volatile the operations together tend to offset each other significantly reducing the overall volatility of the midstream and marketing segment based on its framework of controls and risk management systems occidental does not expect the volatility of these operations to be significant to the company as a whole 

segment results of operations 

segment earnings exclude income taxes interest income interest expense environmental remediation expenses unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments equity investments seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in occidentals consolidated quarterly earnings during the year 

the following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items 



 

 

oil and gas 

dollars in millions except as indicated 



 

the following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil ngls and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013  the differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at occidental’s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers 







 

 

oil and gas segment earnings in 2013 included pretax charges of 06 billion for the impairment of domestic nonproducing acreage while earnings in 2012 included pretax charges of 17 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items in 2011 oil and gas segment earnings included pretax charges of 35 million related to exploration writeoffs in libya and 29 million related to colombia net worth tax as well as a pretax gain of 22 million from the sale of an interest in a colombian pipeline 

oil and gas segment earnings prior to the impairment charges in both years were 85 billion in 2013 compared to 88 billion in 2012 the yearoveryear change in earnings resulted from higher domestic earnings which were more than offset by lower international earnings higher domestic earnings resulted from improved oil and gas realized prices higher liquids volumes and lower operating costs partially offset by higher dda rates stock price driven increases in equity compensation and lower ngl prices lower international earnings were caused by lower liquids sales volumes lower oil prices and higher operating costs and dda rates in the middle eastnorth africa 

average production costs for 2013 excluding taxes other than on income were 1376 per boe compared to 1499 per boe for 2012 this decrease reflected the impact of the domestic operational efficiency initiative where production costs decreased by 300 per boe from 1743 per boe in 2012 to 1443 per boe in 2013 the domestic decrease was partially offset by higher international production costs due to higher volumes from iraq which has high operating costs 

average daily oil and gas production volumes were 763000 boe for 2013 compared to 766000 boe for 2012 occidentals daily domestic oil and ngl production increased by 11000 boe and 4000 boe respectively while gas production decreased by 33 mmcf these results reflect occidentals focus on oil drilling while reducing its drilling capital for gas in light of higher oil prices and lower gas prices in recent years while domestic overall production improved by 9000 boe per day in 2013 international production was 12000 boe per day lower mainly due to lower cost recovery barrels in the dolphin and oman operations and field and port strikes in libya average daily sales volumes were 762000 boe in the 12 months of 2013 compared to 764000 boe for the same period in 2012 

oil and gas segment earnings prior to the charges and other items noted above were 88 billion in 2012 compared to 103 billion in 2011 the decrease reflected lower ngl and gas prices and higher dda rates maintenance activity field support costs and exploration expense partially offset by higher oil prices and domestic volumes 

average daily oil and gas production volumes were 766000 boe for 2012 compared to 733000 boe for 2011 occidentals domestic production increased by 9 percent while total company production increased by 5 percent dolphins full cost recovery of prestartup capital which reduced production was the only operation where pscs and similar contracts had an appreciable effect on 2012 

production volumes average daily sales volumes were 764000 boe in the twelve months of 2012 compared to 731000 boe for the same period in 2011 

chemical 



chemical segment earnings were 612 million in 2013 excluding the 131 million gain on sale of the carbocloro investment compared to 720 million in 2012 the yearoveryear change in chemical segment earnings reflected higher energy and ethylene costs and lower chloralkali and chlorinated organics pricing driven by continued unfavorable supply and demand fundamentals and reduced export demand 

chemical segment earnings were 720 million in 2012 compared to 861 million in 2011 the reduction was primarily the result of lower margins due to weaker economic conditions in europe and asia and increased competitive activity from these regions the calcium chloride and potassium hydroxide businesses were also negatively impacted in 2012 by a mild winter and drought conditions in the united states 

midstream marketing and other 



midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2013  were 543 million excluding the 10 billion pretax gain from the sale of a portion of an investment in plains pipeline and other items compared to 439 million in 2012  the 2013 results reflected higher earnings in the pipeline and power generation businesses and improved marketing and trading performance marketing performance improved by 110 million mainly as a result of capturing regional crude price differentials by utilizing new pipelines providing access to the gulf coast refineries these improvements were partially offset by lower income in the gas processing business due in part to the plant turnarounds in the permian basin operations 

midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2012 were 439 million compared to 448 million in 2011 the 2012 results reflected lower gas processing earnings partially offset by improved marketing and trading performance 

 

significant items affecting earnings 

the following table sets forth for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  significant transactions and events affecting occidental’s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature timing and amount 



 

taxes 

deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets of 16 billion were 70 billion at december 31 2013  the current portion of the deferred tax assets of 150 million is included in other current assets the deferred tax assets net of allowances are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences 

worldwide effective tax rate 

the following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations 



occidental’s 2013  worldwide tax rate was 39 percent slightly lower than 2012  due to proportionately higher domestic pretax income in 2013 the 2012 worldwide tax rate was higher than 2011 due to proportionately higher foreign pretax income in 2012 

a deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries as it is occidental’s intention generally to reinvest such earnings permanently if the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested an additional deferred tax liability of approximately 134 million would be required assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits 

consolidated results of operations 

changes in components of occidentals results of operations are discussed below 

revenue and other income items 



the increase in net sales in 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly due to improved domestic oil and gas realized prices and higher liquids volumes partially offset by lower international liquids volumes and oil prices 

the increase in net sales in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to higher oil volumes and prices partially offset by lower gas and ngl prices and lower prices and volumes across most chemical products 

price and volume changes in the oil and gas segment generally represent a substantially larger portion of the overall change in net sales than the chemical and midstream and marketing segments 

the 2013 gain on sale of equity investments relates to the pretax gains from the sales of a portion of the investment in plains pipeline and the carbocloro investment 

expense items 



cost of sales decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower oil and gas operating costs partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment   the reduction in oil and gas operating costs 

 

reflected a wide range of initiatives including highgrading of service rigs improved job scheduling and liquids usage and handling optimizing field supervision and reduced consumption of fuel power and field rental equipment 

cost of sales increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher oil and gas volumes and operating costs mostly resulting from higher maintenance activity and field support costs partially offset by lower feedstock and energy costs in the chemical segment 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2013 due to higher compensation and employeerelated costs in particular higher equity compensation due to higher stock prices and higher headcount in 2013 compared to 2012 as well as the charge related to the employment and postemployment benefits for occidentals former executive chairman and termination of certain other employees and consulting arrangements 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2012 due to higher headcount partially offset by lower equity compensation expense and the colombia net worth tax which increased the 2011 costs 

dda increased in each year from 2011 to 2013  generally due to higher dda rates and to a lesser extent the changes in volumes in the oil and gas segment 

asset impairments and related items in 2013 of 621 million were mostly related to the impairment of certain nonproducing domestic oil and gas acreage 

asset impairments and related items in 2012 were almost all in midcontinent over 90 percent of which were related to natural gas properties that were acquired more than five years ago on average when gas prices were above 6 per mcf 

taxes other than on income increased in each year from 2011  to 2013  due to higher domestic oil volumes and oil and gas prices during the period from 2011 to 2013 these expenses also reflected increasing domestic ad valorem taxes resulting from higher property values and california greenhouse gas costs 

interest and debt expense net in 2011 included a 163 million early debt extinguishment charge  

other items 



provision for income taxes increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher pretax income partially offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate the lower tax rate was due to higher proportional domestic pretax income in 2013 compared to 2012 

provision for income taxes decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower pretax income partially offset by a slightly higher effective tax rate the higher tax rate was due to higher proportional foreign pretax income in 2012 compared to 2011 

discontinued operations net in 2011 included the 144 million aftertax gain recorded from the sale of the argentine operations 

consolidated analysis of financial position 

the changes in select components of occidental’s balance sheet are discussed below 

balance sheet components 



assets 

see liquidity and capital resources — cash flow analysis for discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents 

the increase in trade receivables net was due to higher oil and gas prices and higher equity and thirdparty oil volumes at the end of 2013 compared to the end of 2012 the decrease in inventories primarily resulted from lower storage inventories the decrease in other current assets mainly reflected the collection of a tax refund in 2013 the decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to the sales of a portion of occidentals interest in plains pipeline and the investment in carbocloro the increase in ppe net was due to capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and gas properties partially offset by dda and asset impairments 

liabilities and stockholders equity 

the decrease in current maturities of longterm debt was due to the redemption of the 600 million senior notes that matured in 2013 the increase in accounts payable reflected higher oil and gas prices higher equity and thirdparty oil volumes and higher capital expenditures at the end of 2013 compared to the end of 2012 the december 31 2013 accrued liability balance included the accrual of the fourth quarter 2013 dividend to be paid in 2014 while the 2012 balance did not include a dividend accrual due to 

 

the accelerated payment of the fourth quarter dividend during that year the increase in domestic and foreign income taxes reflected the lack of a 2012 accrual resulting from a refund due at the end of that year the increase in deferred and other domestic and foreign income taxes was mainly due to faster tax depreciation on capital expenditures the decrease in deferred credits and other liabilities was primarily due to the reduction of pension and postretirement plan liabilities the increase in stockholders equity reflected net income for 2013 and reduced pension and postretirement obligations partially offset by dividends and treasury stock purchases 

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2013  occidental had approximately 34 billion in cash and cash equivalents while a substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the united states   occidental believes the cash in foreign jurisdictions can be brought to the united states without paying significant taxes    income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segments prices sales volumes and costs occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs and planned capital expenditures dividends and any debt payments 

occidental has a bank credit facility credit facility with a 20 billion  commitment expiring in 2016 no amounts have been drawn under this credit facility up to 10 billion  of the credit facility is available in the form of letters of credit borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at various benchmark rates including libor plus a margin based on occidentals senior debt ratings additionally occidental paid average annual facility fees of 008 percent in 2013 on the total commitment amounts of the credit facility 

the credit facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur the credit facility and other debt agreements do not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict occidentals ability to borrow or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt 

as of december 31 2013  under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on or acquisitions of occidental stock occidental also has a shelf registration statement that facilitates future issuances of securities 

occidental from time to time may access and has accessed debt markets for general corporate purposes including acquisitions at this time occidental does not anticipate any need for such funding 

cash flow analysis 



net income increased by 13 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 while cash provided by operating activities increased by 16 billion these differences reflect working capital changes and collection of a tax refund increased cash flow from operations by 18 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 offset by the 12 billion gains on sales of equity investments in 2013 and 03 billion of lower noncash charges the most significant changes in noncash charges from 2012 to 2013 were lower asset impairments by 11 billion partially offset by higher dda expenses by 08 billion the 2013 net income included gains on the sales of equity investments for which cash is reported as an investing activity 

the increase in operating cash flows in 2013 compared to 2012 also reflected lower domestic oil and gas operating costs 3percent and 29percent higher domestic prices for oil and gas respectively and higher domestic oil volumes partially offset by the middle eastnorth africas lower oil volumes and prices and higher operating costs 

other cost elements such as labor costs and overhead are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flow than the changes in oil and gas product prices and volumes and operating costs 

although net income decreased by 22 billion for the 12 months ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period of 2011 net cash provided by operating activities only decreased by 10 billion for this period compared to 2011 net income in 2012 included much larger noncash charges which reduced net income but not cash provided by operating activities these noncash charges mainly comprised asset impairments and higher dda working capital changes in 2012 further reduced cash flow from operations by approximately 08 billion compared to 2011 

additionally operating cash flows in 2012 compared to 2011 reflected lower domestic gas and worldwide ngl prices by 35 percent and 19 percent respectively and higher maintenance activity and field support costs partially offset by higher domestic oil volumes and 2percent higher worldwide oil prices the positive cashflow impact of the oil price change was more than offset by the negative effect of significant declines in gas and ngl prices the decrease in operating cash flows in 2012 compared to 2011 also reflected lower chemical margins primarily due to weaker economic conditions in europe and asia 

the impact of the chemical and the midstream and marketing segments on overall cash flows is generally less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment because the chemical and midstream and marketing segments are significantly smaller 

 

other noncash charges to income in 2013 2012 and 2011 included charges for stockbased compensation plans and asset retirement obligation accruals 

operating cash flows for discontinued operations include the argentine operations through the date they were sold in 2011 



compared to 102 billion in 2012 occidentals net capital expenditures for 2013 were 88 billion after 02 billion in bridgetex partner contributions which are included in financing activities the decrease in capital expenditures of 14 billion from 2012 to 2013 was mainly due to the 12 billion decrease in oil and gas expenditures a majority of which was in domestic properties this reduction reflected cost savings from occidentals efficiency initiatives the increase for the chemical segment was due to the continued construction of the tennessee chloralkali facility the decrease in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was due to lower spending for the al hosn gas project partially offset by increased spending for bridgetex 

occidental’s net capital spending is expected to increase in 2014 to approximately 102 billion compared to 88 billion in 2013 approximately 12 billion of the increase will be in the oil and gas segment and includes additional capital allocated to the california and permian basin operations of approximately 04 billion each those operations will use the capital almost entirely for additional oil drilling to accelerate their development plans and production growth an additional 01 billion is expected to be spent on these and other domestic assets for facilities projects that were deferred in 2013 occidental also expects to continue to fund growth opportunities in key international assets mainly oman and qatar which will get approximately 03 billion of the increased capital and complete the al hosn gas project where the capital expenditures are expected to be lower in 2014 compared to 2013 exploration capital is expected to increase by approximately 01 billion in part due to deferred spending in 2013 the total midstream and marketing capital will increase by approximately 01 billion for the bridgetex pipeline and the chemical capital will increase slightly due to the ethylene cracker project announced in 2013 the 2014 capital program is expected to be approximately 80 percent in oil and gas 7 percent in the al hosn gas project 

7 percent in domestic midstream and marketing and the remainder in the chemical segment 

the 2013 other investing activities net amount included 16 billion of cash received from the sales of a portion of occidentals interest in plains pipeline and the investment in carbocloro partially offset by 06 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets largely consisting of various interests in domestic oil and gas properties 

the increase in capital expenditures of 27 billion from 2011 to 2012 was mainly due to the 21 billion increase in oil and gas expenditures a majority of which was in domestic properties such as permian and california as well as increases throughout the middle east the increase in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was almost entirely due to the al hosn gas project 

the 2012 other investing activities net amount included 25 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets largely consisting of various interests in domestic oil and gas properties in the permian basin the williston basin california and south texas also included in 2012 investing activities was approximately 190 million of cash dividends received as investment returns 

the 2011 other investing activities net amount included 49 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets including various interests in domestic oil and gas properties in operated producing and nonproducing properties in california and the permian and williston basins for approximately 24 billion properties in south texas for 18 billion and 05 billion for occidental’s share of preacquisition development expenditures incurred by the al hosn gas project 

investing cash flow from discontinued operations included 26 billion of cash received from the sale of the argentine operations in 2011 

commitments at december 31 2013  for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures were approximately 21 billion  which will be due in 2014 and beyond occidental expects to fund its commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations 



the 2013 net cash used by financing activities included 07 billion used to retire debt and 02 billion of contributions received from a noncontrolling interest common stock dividends paid decreased by 06 billion to 16 billion in 2013 due to the accelerated payment in 2012 of that years fourth quarter dividend in addition purchases of treasury stock increased from 06 billion in 2012 to over 09 billion in 2013 higher 2013 net cash use compared to 2012 also reflected the net proceeds in 2012 of approximately 17 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes that year 

 

in 2012 common stock dividends paid increased by 07 billion to 21 billion compared to 2011 which included the accelerated payment of the fourth quarter dividend in addition purchases of treasury stock increased from 03 billion in 2011 to 06 billion in 2012 the 2012 cash flows also reflected 17 billion of proceeds from the issuance of unsecured notes 

the 2011 amount included net proceeds of approximately 21 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and cash use of 15 billion to retire longterm debt 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of occidentals offbalancesheet arrangements 

guarantees 

occidental has guaranteed certain equity investees debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds letters of credit indemnities and commitments provided by occidental to third parties mainly to provide assurance that opc or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees as of december 31 2013  occidental’s guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately 354 million of dolphin’s debt the fair value of the guarantees was immaterial 

see oil and gas segment — business review — qatar and “segment results of operations” for further information about dolphin 

leases 

occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements mainly for transportation equipment power plants machinery terminals storage facilities land and office space occidental leases assets when leasing offers greater operating flexibility lease payments are generally expensed as part of cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses for more information see contractual obligations 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes and crossreferences occidental’s contractual obligations this summary indicates on and offbalancesheet obligations as of december 31 2013  



 

delivery commitments 

occidental has made commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil gas and ngls the total amount contracted to be delivered a substantial majority of which is in the united states is approximately 73 million barrels of oil through 2019 83 billion cubic feet of gas through 2016 and 15 million barrels of ngls through 2015 the price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall none of the commitments in any given year is expected to have a material impact on occidentals financial statements 

lawsuits claims and contingencies 

opc or certain of its subsidiaries are involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property damage or other losses punitive damages civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief opc or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and 

 

similar federal state local and foreign environmental laws these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties and injunctive relief usually opc or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies further some lawsuits claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction 

occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters reserve balances for other matters as of december 31 2013  and 2012  were not material to occidentals consolidated balance sheets occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations environmental matters are further discussed under the caption environmental liabilities and expenditures below 

during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax jurisdictions although taxable years through 2009 for united states federal income tax purposes have been audited by the united states internal revenue service irs pursuant to its compliance assurance program subsequent taxable years are currently under review additionally in december 2012 occidental filed united states federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 which are subject to irs review taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions in certain of these jurisdictions tax authorities are in various stages of auditing occidentals income taxes during the course of tax audits disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

opc its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2013  occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality occidental’s environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in the future occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand 

environmental remediation 

the laws that require or address environmental remediation including cercla and similar federal state local and foreign laws may apply retroactively and regardless of fault the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites opc or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating closed and thirdparty sites remedial activities may include one or more of the following investigation involving sampling modeling risk assessment or monitoring cleanup measures including removal treatment or disposal or operation and maintenance of remedial systems the environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties injunctive relief and government oversight costs 

as of december 31 2013  occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 157 sites the following table presents occidental’s environmental remediation reserves as of december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the us environmental protection agency on the cercla national priorities list npl sites and three categories of nonnpl sites — thirdparty sites occidentaloperated sites and closed or nonoperated occidental sites 



 

as of december 31 2013  occidental’s environmental reserves exceeded 10 million each at 10 of the 157 sites described above and 108 of the sites had reserves from 0 to 1 million each 

as of december 31 2013  two sites — a landfill in western new york owned by occidental and a former facility in new york — accounted for 60 percent of its reserves associated with npl sites in connection with a 1986 acquisition maxus energy corporation has retained the liability and is indemnifying occidental for 14 of the remaining npl sites 

as of december 31 2013  maxus has also retained the liability and is indemnifying occidental for 8 of the 74 thirdparty sites three of the remaining 66 thirdparty sites — a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee a containment and removal project in tennessee and an active refinery in louisiana where occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities — accounted for 52 percent of occidental’s reserves associated with these sites 

four sites — chemical plants in kansas louisiana and new york and a group of oil and gas properties in the southwestern united states — accounted for 61 percent of the reserves associated with the occidentaloperated sites 

four other sites — a landfill in western new york former chemical plants in tennessee and delaware and a closed coal mine in pennsylvania — accounted for 64 percent of the reserves associated with closed or nonoperated occidental sites 

environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation the following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years 



based on current estimates occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four  years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10  or more years occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to 380 million see critical accounting policies and estimates — environmental liabilities and expenditures for additional information 

environmental costs 

occidental’s environmental costs some of which include estimates are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended december 31 



operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures relate to longerlived improvements in properties currently operated by occidental remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations 

occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately 130 million for 2014 

foreign investments 

many of occidental’s assets are located outside north america at december 31 2013  the carrying value of occidental’s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately 137 billion or approximately 20 percent of occidental’s total assets at that date of such assets approximately 119 billion are located in the middle eastnorth africa and approximately 17 billion are located in latin america for the year ended december 31 2013  net sales outside north america totaled 82 billion or approximately 34 percent of total net sales 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires occidentals management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts there has been no material change to occidentals critical accounting policies over the past three years the selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve managements judgment 

 

oil and gas properties 

the carrying value of occidental’s ppe represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest net of accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization and any impairment charges for assets acquired ppe cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets 

occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found if proved reserves have been found the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized otherwise occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense in some cases a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12month period after drilling is complete 

occidental expenses annual lease rentals the costs of injectants used in production and geological geophysical and seismic costs as incurred 

occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unitofproduction method it amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves 

proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 

several factors could change occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves for example occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices in other cases particularly with longlived properties lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical for such properties higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical estimation of 

future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded in 2013  revisions of previous estimates provided a net 4 million boe increase in proved reserves which amounted to less than 1 percent of occidentals total reserves as of december 31 2013  

additionally occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties when product prices decline other than temporarily reserve estimates change significantly other significant events occur or managements plans change with respect to these properties in a manner that may impact occidentals ability to realize the recorded asset amounts impairment tests incorporate a number of assumptions involving expectations of undiscounted future cash flows which can change significantly over time these assumptions include estimates of future product prices which occidental bases on forward price curves and when applicable contractual prices estimates of oil and gas reserves and estimates of future expected operating and development costs any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

the most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in occidentals oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the dda rate for example a 5percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the dda rate by approximately 085 per barrel which would increase or decrease pretax income by approximately 240 million annually at current production rates the change in the dda rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial 

a portion of the carrying value of occidental’s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties at december 31 2013  the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were 36 billion the unproved amounts are not subject to dda until they are classified as proved properties as exploration and development work progresses if reserves on these properties are proved capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to dda if the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful or management decided not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices higher development and operating costs contractual conditions or other factors the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed the timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties if warranted depends upon managements plans the nature timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance 

 

during its annual capital planning process in the fourth quarter of 2013  management determined that it would not pursue development of certain of its nonproducing domestic oil and gas acreage based on product prices availability of transportation capacity to market the products and regulatory and environmental considerations as a result occidental recorded pretax impairment charges of 06 billion for the acreage 

the profitability of certain of occidentals middle eastnorth africa operations and in turn its ability to realize its recorded asset values is dependent upon the success of future development plans or normalization of operations in some locations further the strategic review occidental is currently undertaking may result in the sale of certain assets some of which may result in losses such losses if any will be recorded when a definitive sale decision is made 

chemical assets 

occidentals chemical assets are depreciated using either the unitofproduction or the straightline method based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets which range from three years to 50 years are also used for impairment tests the estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance as well as planned major maintenance activities pmma ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred pmma costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul additionally occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use these capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service the resulting revision if any of the asset’s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively 

without these continued expenditures the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition demand feedstock costs energy prices environmental regulations and technological changes 

occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

occidentals net ppe for the chemical segment is approximately 28 billion and its depreciation expense for 2014 is expected to be approximately 325 million the most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical plants would be on depreciation expense for example a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pretax earnings by approximately 45 million per year 

midstream marketing and other assets 

derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cashflow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment otherwise any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period for cashflow hedges the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income oci with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged realized gains or losses from cashflow hedges and any ineffective portion are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location quality grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income there were no fair value hedges as of and during the year ended december 31 2013  

a hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if at inception and throughout its life it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows respectively of the hedging instrument in the case of hedging a forecast transaction the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable 

occidentals midstream and marketing ppe is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using either the unitofproduction or straightline method occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

 

fair value measurements 

occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a threelevel fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation techniques level 1 – using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities level 2 – using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities and level 3 – using unobservable inputs transfers between levels if any are recognized at the end of each reporting period 

fair values  recurring 

occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs occidental utilizes the midpoint between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value in addition to using market data occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique for assets and liabilities carried at fair value occidental measures fair value using the following methods 

 occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a marketobservable price for an identical or similar asset or liability this approach utilizes managements judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows and discounts those cash flows using a riskadjusted discount rate 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience remedial objectives available technologies applicable laws and regulations and costsharing arrangements occidental bases environmental reserves on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred using the most costeffective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established the reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established the amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received or when receipt of recovery is highly probable as of december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  occidental did not have any accruals for reimbursements or recoveries 

many factors could affect occidental’s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses the most significant are 1 cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate 2 the length of time type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination 3 a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify occidental’s proposed remedial plan 4 improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs 5 laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability and 6 changes in allocation or costsharing arrangements may occur 

certain sites involve multiple parties with various costsharing arrangements which fall into the following three categories 1 environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties 2 oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest or 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of properties in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs in these circumstances occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable the degree of their commitment to participate and the 

 

consequences to occidental of their failure to participate when estimating occidentals ultimate share of liability occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and based on these factors believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved 

in addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures which often take in excess of 10 years at npl sites occidentals reserves include managements estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly 

if occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings for example if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent occidental would record a pretax gain of 33 million if the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 33 million 

other loss contingencies 

occidental is involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings and audits occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis 

loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate management’s judgments could change based on new information changes in or interpretations of laws or regulations changes in management’s plans or intentions opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings or other factors see lawsuits claims and other contingencies for additional information 

significant accounting and disclosure changes 

listed below are significant recently adopted accounting and disclosure changes 

offsetting assets and liabilities 

beginning in the quarter ended march 31 2013 occidental adopted new disclosure requirements relating to its derivatives in accordance with rules issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb in december 2011 and january 2013 these new rules require tabular disclosures of the outstanding derivatives gross and net fair values now including those derivatives that are subject to a master netting or similar arrangement and qualify for net presentation whether or not offset in the consolidated balance sheet 

reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income 

beginning in the quarter ended march 31 2013 occidental adopted new disclosure requirements for reporting amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income into the income statement in accordance with rules issued by the fasb in february 2013 

these new disclosures were not material to occidentals financial statements 

derivative activities and market risk 

commodity price risk 

general 

occidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil ngl and natural gas prices price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect occidental’s pretax annual income by approximately 150 million for a 1 per barrel change in oil prices and 30 million for a 1 per barrel change in ngl prices if domestic natural gas prices varied by 050 per mcf it would have an estimated annual effect on occidentals pretax income of approximately 100 million these pricechange sensitivities include the impact of psc and similar contract volume changes on income if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidental’s results to prices also will change the marketing and trading results are sensitive to price changes of oil gas and to a lesser degree other commodities these sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing and trading volumes and cannot be predicted reliably 

occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices a variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of 10 per ton would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 10 million and 30 million respectively a variation in pvc prices of 001  per lb would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 25 million historically over time product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins according to ihs chemical december 2013 average contract prices were chlorine—245 per ton caustic soda—583 per ton and pvc—061 per lb 

occidental uses derivative instruments including a combination of shortterm futures forwards options and swaps to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas occidental only occasionally hedges its oil and gas production and when it does so the volumes are usually insignificant additionally occidental’s phibro trading unit engages in trading activities using derivatives for the purpose of generating profits mainly from market price changes of commodities 

 

risk management 

occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy the controls under this policy are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which manages risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check members of the risk management group report to the corporate vice president and treasurer the president and chief executive officer and executive vice president of operations also oversee these controls controls for these activities include limits on value at risk limits on credit limits on total notional trade value segregation of duties delegation of authority daily price verifications daily reporting to senior management of positions together with various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls additionally these operations maintain highly liquid positions as a result of which the market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice 

fair value of marketing and trading derivative contracts 

occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing and trading activities at fair value fair values for these contracts are derived principally from level 1 and level 2 sources 

the following table shows the fair value of occidentals derivatives excluding collateral segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation 



note  includes cashflow hedges further discussed below 

cashflow hedges 

occidental entered into financial swap agreements in november 2012 for the sale of a portion of its natural gas production in california these swap agreements hedge 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day beginning in january 2013 through march 2014 and qualify as cashflow hedges the weightedaverage strike price of these swaps is 430 

occidental’s marketing and trading operations store natural gas purchased from third parties at occidental’s north american leased storage facilities derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes through march 31 2014 as of december 31 2013  and 2012  occidental had approximately 11 billion cubic feet and 20 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage respectively as of december 31 2013  and 2012  occidental had cashflow hedges for the forecast sale to be settled by physical delivery of approximately 13 billion cubic feet and 20 billion cubic feet of this stored natural gas respectively 

as of december 31 2013  the total fair value of cashflow hedges which was a net liability of 4 million was included in the total fair value table in fair value of marketing and trading derivative contracts above 

quantitative information 

occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commoditybased and foreign currency derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities this method determines the maximum potential negative shortterm change in fair value with at least a 95percent level of confidence additionally occidental uses trading limits including among others limits on total notional trade value and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice as a result of these controls occidental has determined that the market risk of the marketing and trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its operations 

interest rate risk 

general 

occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variablerate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2013  variablerate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of occidentals total debt 

tabular presentation of interest rate risk 

the table below provides information about occidentals debt obligations debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date 



 

 

credit risk 

occidentals credit risk relates primarily to its derivative financial instruments and trade receivables occidental’s contracts are spread among a large number of counterparties creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances current activity and forward marktomarket exposure 

a substantial portion of occidental’s derivative transaction volume is executed through exchangetraded contracts which are subject to nominal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions is settled on a daily margin basis with select clearinghouses and brokers occidental executes the rest of its derivative transactions in the otc market occidental is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong by spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties by entering into master netting arrangements with the counterparties and by requiring collateral as appropriate occidental actively monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and records valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty risk if necessary 

certain of occidentals otc derivative instruments contain creditriskcontingent features primarily tied to credit ratings for occidental or its counterparties which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post as of december 31 2013  and 2012  occidental had a net liability of 8 million and 34 million respectively which are net of collateral posted of 23 million and 64 million respectively occidental believes that if it had received a onenotch reduction in its credit ratings it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateralposting requirements as of december 31 2013  and 2012  

as of december 31 2013  the substantial majority of the credit exposures was with investment grade counterparties occidental believes its exposure to creditrelated losses at december 31 2013  was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented 

foreign currency risk 

occidental’s foreign operations have limited currency risk occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes a vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in united states dollars additionally all of occidental’s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the united states dollar as the functional currency as of december 31 2013  the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the trading operations was immaterial the effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income

 item 1a risk factors 

volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affects occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products particularly oil and to a lesser extent natural gas and its chemical products 

changes in consumption patterns global and local economic conditions inventory levels production disruptions the actions of opec currency exchange rates worldwide drilling and exploration activities technological developments weather geophysical and technical limitations transportation bottlenecks and other matters affect the supply and demand dynamics of oil and gas which along with the effect of changes in market perceptions contribute to price unpredictability and volatility 

demand and consequently the price obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the united states and global economies as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

occidental’s oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its results of operations and its ability to grow production and replace reserves 

results of operations reserve replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend in part on occidental’s ability to profitably acquire develop or find additional reserves occidental has many competitors including national oil companies some of which i are larger and better funded ii may be willing to accept greater risks or iii have special competencies competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts during periods of low product prices any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts 

occidental may experience delays cost overruns losses or unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities 

occidental bears the risks of development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for drilling and other permits equipment failures construction delays escalating costs or competition for services materials supplies or labor property or border disputes disappointing reservoir performance and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns 

exploration is inherently risky exploration is subject to delays misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses 

 

governmental actions and political instability may affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s businesses are subject to the decisions of many governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 

 occidental may experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its foreign operations are located in countries occasionally affected by political instability armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production comes from foreign sources 

occidental faces risks associated with its acquisitions and divestitures 

occidental’s acquisition and divestiture activities carry risks that it may i not fully realize anticipated benefits due to lessthanexpected reserves or production or changed circumstances such as the deterioration of natural gas prices over the last few years ii bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties iii experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity or iv assume or retain liabilities that are greater than anticipated 

occidental’s oil and gas reserves are based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on engineers periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability including production decline rates operating performance and economic feasibility at the prevailing commodity prices as well as capital and operating costs if occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected 

concerns about climate change may affect occidental’s operations 

the us federal government and the state of california have adopted and other jurisdictions are considering legislation regulations or policies that seek to control or reduce the production use or emissions of “greenhouse gases” ghg to control or reduce the production or consumption of fossil fuels and to increase the use of renewable or alternative energy sources for example california’s capandtrade program currently applies to occidentals operations in the state the us environmental protection agency has begun to regulate certain ghg emissions from both stationary and mobile sources the uncertain outcome and timing of existing and proposed international national and state measures make it difficult to predict their business impact however occidental could face risks of project execution higher costs and taxes and lower demand for and restrictions on the use of its products as a result of ongoing ghg reduction efforts 

occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic events 

the occurrence of events such as earthquakes hurricanes floods well blowouts fires explosions chemical releases industrial accidents physical attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses 

cyber attacks could significantly affect occidental 

cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years occidental relies on electronic systems and networks to control and manage its oil and gas chemicals trading and pipeline operations and has multiple layers of security to mitigate risks of cyber attack if however occidental were to experience an attack and its security measures failed the potential consequences to its businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant in 2009 and 2010 occidental experienced a cyber attack on its email system which had no effect on its operations financial systems or reputation

manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls the midstream marketing and other segment midstream and marketing gathers processes transports stores purchases and markets oil condensate ngls natural gas carbon dioxide co 2  and power it also trades around its assets including transportation and storage capacity and trades oil ngls gas and other commodities the segment also invests in entities that conduct similar activities 

strategy 

general 

occidental aims to maximize total returns to stockholders using the following strategies 

 in conducting its business occidental accepts commodity engineering and limited exploration risks occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks 

occidental prioritizes the use of its cash flows in the following order 

 capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner management aims to develop occidentals assets in a manner that they would contribute substantially to earnings and cash flow after invested capital the following describes the application of occidentals overall strategy to each of its operating segments 

oil and gas 

segment earnings 

 millions 

occidental prefers to hold large longlived legacy oil and gas assets like those in california and the permian basin that tend to have enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to costeffective production occidental also focuses a portion of its drilling activities on unconventional shale opportunities 

the oil and gas business seeks to increase its oil and gas production profitably and add new reserves at a pace 

 

ahead of production while minimizing costs incurred for finding and development of such reserves the oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by 

 over the past several years occidental has strengthened its asset base within its core areas occidental has invested in and disposed of assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets 

in 2012 occidental paid approximately 23 billion for domestic oil and gas properties in the permian basin the williston basin california and south texas 

management currently believes occidentals growth will be most strongly affected by the success of the development plans for its permian california and oman assets and the al hosn gas project in abu dhabi where it continues to deploy significant capital occidentals oil and gas production has grown approximately five percent annually during the threeyear period ended december 31 2012 

chemical 

segment earnings 

 millions 

the primary objective of the chemical business is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve abovecostofcapital returns the chemical segments oxychem strategy is to be a lowcost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine which is coproduced with caustic soda and markets both to third parties in addition chlorine together with ethylene is converted through a series of intermediate products into pvc oxychems focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of 

economies of scale capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chloralkali and pvc businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities during 2012 oxychem began construction of a chloralkali plant in tennessee which it expects to begin operating in the fourth quarter of 2013 

midstream and marketing 

segment earnings 

 millions 

the midstream and marketing segment is managed to generate returns on capital employed in excess of occidentals cost of capital in order to generate these returns the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to other segments and third parties in marketing its own and thirdparty production occidental strives to maximize realized value using its assets including transportation and storage capacity in commodities trading occidental seeks to generate gains using netlong positions the segment invests in and operates gas plants cogeneration facilities pipeline systems and storage facilities the segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas power and other commodities used in occidentals businesses and to limit credit risk exposure capital is employed to sustain or where appropriate increase operational capacity and to improve the competitiveness of occidentals assets occidental and magellan midstream partners lp are proceeding with the construction of the bridgetex pipeline which will transport crude oil between the permian region and the gulf coast refinery markets and is expected to begin service in mid2014 

key performance indicators 

general 

occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return in addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics 



 

 occidental also monitors other segmentspecific indicators such as perunit profit production costs and finding and development costs as well as health environmental and safety measures like the number of recordable injuries and others 

based on the 256 per share annual dividend rate announced in february 2013  occidental’s dividend rate has increased by 412 percent since 2002 while its stockholders equity increased by 6 percent for 2012  and 37 percent for the threeyear period from 2010 through 2012  occidental continued to deliver abovecostofcapital returns as follows 



 

debt structure 

occidental issued 175 billion of senior unsecured notes in the second quarter of 2012  for general corporate purposes including ordinary course working capital increases acquisitions stock repurchases retirement of debt and other business opportunities as a result of occidental’s commitment to financial discipline its yearend 2012  total debttocapitalization debt and equity ratio was 16 percent 

oil and gas segment 

business environment 

oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s short and intermediateterm financial performance the following table presents the average daily west texas intermediate wti brent and new york mercantile exchange nymex prices for 2012  and 2011  



the following table presents occidentals average realized prices as a percentage of wti brent and nymex for 2012  and 2011  



average realized oil prices were slightly higher in 2012 than 2011 approximately 60 percent of occidental’s oil production tracks world oil prices such as brent and 40 percent tracks wti the average realized domestic natural gas price in 2012  decreased 35 percent from 2011  

prices and differentials can vary significantly even on a shortterm basis making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty 

operations 

domestic interests 

occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns occidentals domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years which is extended through the end of production once production commences of the total 81 million net acres in which occidental has interests approximately 74 percent is leased 25 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights 

productionsharing contracts psc 

occidental has interests that are operated under pscs or similar contracts in bahrain iraq libya oman qatar and yemen under such contracts occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain production costs and an additional share for profit in addition occidentals share of production and reserves from operations in long beach california and certain contracts in colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher

permian 

occidentals permian production is diversified across a large number of producing areas in the permian basin the permian basin extends throughout southwest texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states accounting for approximately 15 percent of the total united states oil production 

occidental is the largest producer of oil in the permian basin with an approximate 16 percent net share of the total oil production occidental also produces and processes natural gas and ngls in the permian basin occidental continued to increase its permian interests in 2012 through various acquisitions a significant portion of which related to its nonco 2 operations which comprised approximately 15 million net acres at the end of 2012 

approximately 60 percent of occidental’s permian oil production is from fields that actively employ co 2  flood technology an enhanced oil recovery eor technique this technique involves injecting co 2  into oil reservoirs where it causes the oil to flow more freely into producing wells these co 2  flood operations make occidental a world leader in the application of this technology 

occidental’s interests in permian offer significant additional development and exploitation potential during 2012  occidental drilled approximately 550 wells on its operated properties and participated in additional wells drilled on thirdpartyoperated properties occidental also focused on improving the performance of existing wells 

occidentals permian nonco 2 operations are among its fastest growing assets since beginning significant delineation and development efforts in 2010 production from these operations has increased by more than 25 percent the development program continued to increase in 2012 accounting for more than 300 of the wells drilled in permian 

occidentals share of production in permian was approximately 207000 boe per day in 2012  

california 

occidentals california operations include interests in the elk hills area the wilmington and other fields in the los angeles basin and the ventura san joaquin and sacramento basins occidental has properties in more than 125 fields in california an increase from 2011 resulting from various property acquisitions in 2012 

occidentals interests in the elk hills area include the elk hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of california’s san joaquin valley which it operates with an approximate 78percent interest along with other adjacent properties the elk hills field is the largest producer of gas and ngls in california during 2012  occidental continued to invest in the elk hills area performing infill drilling field extensions and recompletions identified by advanced reservoir characterization techniques resulting in approximately 320 new wells being drilled 

occidental began operating a new gas processing plant in elk hills in 2012 with capacity to handle 200 million cubic feet per day 

occidentals share of production in california was approximately 148000 boe per day in 2012  

occidental holds approximately 21 million net acres in california the large majority of which are net fee mineral interests as a result occidental has a substantial inventory of properties available for future development and exploitation in conventional areas as well as unconventional prospects such as shale occidental drilled approximately 760 wells in california during 2012 

 

midcontinent and other 

the midcontinent and other properties include interests in the hugoton field the piceance basin the williston basin the marcellus shale in the appalachian basin the eagle ford shale and other areas in south texas these properties are located in kansas oklahoma colorado north dakota west virginia and texas occidental holds over 23 million net acres in the midcontinent region which includes 14 million net acres in a large concentration of gas reserves and production and royalty interests in the hugoton area and approximately 04 million net acres in the piceance area occidental also holds approximately 160000 net acres in south texas including 4000 net acres in the eagle ford shale which was acquired in 2012 in addition occidental holds approximately 341000 net acres of oil producing and prospective unconventional properties in the williston basins bakken and three forks formations in addition occidental holds approximately 235000 net acres in west virginia 

in midcontinent and other occidental drilled approximately 260 wells and produced approximately 110000 boe per day in 2012  

other developments 

management conducted a review of occidental’s portfolio of oil and gas assets in the fourth quarter of 2012 and concluded that given the current and anticipated natural gas pricing environment and the effect of reserve revisions from price changes and well performance certain of its domestic natural gas producing properties had become impaired occidental also concluded that certain projects had become uneconomical and that it would not pursue them as a result occidental recorded pretax impairment charges of 17 billion almost all of which were for certain assets in midcontinent over 90 percent of which were related to natural gas properties that were acquired more than four years ago on average when gas prices were more than 6 per mcf

proved reserves 

proved oil ngl and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements oil ngl and gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity quality and transportation costs for the 2012  2011  and 2010  disclosures the calculated average west texas intermediate oil prices were 9471 9619 and 7943 per barrel respectively the calculated average henry hub gas prices for 2012  2011  and 2010  disclosures were 279 404 and 439 per mmbtu respectively 

occidental had proved reserves at yearend 2012  of 3296 million boe as compared with the yearend 2011  amount of 3176 million boe proved reserves at yearend 2012  and 2011  consisted of respectively 62 percent and 63 percent oil 10 percent and 9 percent ngls and 28 percent and 28 percent natural gas proved developed reserves represented approximately 73 percent and 76 percent respectively of occidental’s total proved reserves at yearend 2012  and 2011  

 

occidental does not have any reserves from nontraditional sources for further information regarding occidentals proved reserves see supplemental oil and gas information following the financial statements 

proved reserve additions 

occidentals total proved reserve additions from all sources were 400 million boe in 2012  the total additions were as follows 



occidentals ability to add reserves other than through purchases depends on the success of improved recovery extension and discovery projects each of which depends on reservoir characteristics technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices as well as capital and operating costs many of these factors are outside of management’s control and will affect whether these historical sources of proved reserve additions continue at similar levels 

improved recovery 

in 2012  occidental added proved reserves of 257 million boe from improved recovery through its eor and infill drilling activities generally the improved recovery additions in 2012  were associated with the continued development of properties in california permian south texas and oman these properties comprise both conventional projects which are characterized by the deployment of eor development methods largely employing application of waterflood steamflood or co 2 injection and unconventional projects these types of conventional eor development methods are often applied through existing wells though additional drilling may be required to fully optimize the development configuration waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells steamflooding is the technique of injecting steam into the formation to lower oil viscosity so that it flows more freely into producing wells this process is applied in areas where the oil is too viscous to be effectively moved with water co 2  flooding involves injecting co 2  into oil reservoirs where it causes the oil to flow more freely into producing wells many of occidentals projects including unconventional projects rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells in addition some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells 

extensions and discoveries 

occidental also obtained reserve additions from extensions and discoveries which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs in 2012  extensions and discoveries added 232 million boe a substantial majority of which is attributable to the 

recognition of initial proved undeveloped reserves from the al hosn gas project 

purchases and divestitures of proved reserves 

occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable as market conditions change the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly in 2012  occidental added 94 million boe through purchases of proved reserves largely consisting of several domestic acquisitions in the permian basin california williston basin and south texas 

revisions of previous estimates 

revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic production decline or operating performance data in addition product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental for example higher prices may increase the economically recoverable reserves particularly for domestic properties because the extra margin extends the expected life of the operations offsetting this effect higher prices decrease occidentals share of proved reserves under pscs because less oil is required to recover costs conversely when prices drop occidentals share of proved reserves increases for pscs and economically recoverable reserves may drop for other operations in 2012  revisions of previous estimates provided a net 183 million boe reduction to proved reserves 

in 2012 revisions related to price for the company as a whole were negative a substantial majority of such revisions related to occidentals domestic gas reserves and resulted from lower domestic gas prices these lower prices and the resulting changes in occidentals plans for drilling on gas properties constituted a majority of its total revisions to the extent gas prices recover in the future a portion of these reserves will be reinstated if natural gas prices decrease further for an extended period domestic gas reserves could experience additional negative price revisions 

other negative revisions were mainly due to reservoir performances in elk hills and midcontinent and other the revisions involved several properties where wells experienced higherthanexpected decline rates sizable portions of these revisions were transferred from the proved category to probable possible and contingent categories 

reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data as a result apart from the effect of product prices it is generally more likely that future proved reserve revisions will be positive in aggregate over time rather than negative 

proved undeveloped reserves 

in 2012  occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 443 million boe from improved recovery extensions and discoveries and purchases of the total additions 171 million boe represented additions from 

 

improved recovery primarily in california permian south texas and oman occidental added 46 million boe through purchases of proved undeveloped reserves domestically in the permian and williston basins and california additionally the proved undeveloped reserves increased due to extensions and discoveries mainly from the al hosn gas project these proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by transfers of 229 million boe to the proved developed category as a result of the 2012  development programs and by revisions of 98 million boe which is included in total revisions discussed above these revisions were in the same locations as those discussed above and factors that caused them were substantially the same as those that caused the changes to total proved reserves occidental incurred approximately 34 billion in 2012  to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves permian bahrain california oman and williston accounted for approximately 86 percent of the reserves transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2012  costs to develop proved undeveloped reserves have increased over time and may continue to increase 

reserves evaluation and review process 

occidental’s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of december 31 2012  were made by occidental’s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management the estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by occidental to develop the reserves this process involves reservoir engineers geoscientists planning engineers and financial analysts as part of the proved reserves estimation process all reserves volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates operating costs and capital expenditures price differentials between benchmark prices the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods including estimates from decline curve analysis typecurve analysis material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance these fieldtested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities 

net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 

the current senior vice president reserves for oxy oil and gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates in compliance with sec rules and regulations including the internal audit and review of occidentals oil and gas reserves data the senior vice president has over 30 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business and has held various assignments in north america asia and europe he is a threetime past chair of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee he is an american association of petroleum geologists aapg certified petroleum geologist and currently serves on the aapg committee on resource evaluation he is a member of the society of petroleum evaluation engineers the colorado school of mines potential gas committee and the unece expert group on resource classification he is also an active member of the joint committee on reserves evaluator training jcoret the senior vice president has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in geology from emory university in atlanta 

occidental has a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee consisting of senior corporate officers to review and approve occidentals oil and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidentals board of directors during the year since 2003 occidental has retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum engineering consultants to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes 

in 2012 ryder scott conducted a process review of occidental’s methods and analytical procedures utilized by occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of december 31 2012  in accordance with the us securities and exchange commission sec regulatory standards ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of occidental’s 2012  yearend total proved reserves portfolio in 2012  ryder scott reviewed approximately 20 percent of occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves since being engaged in 2003 ryder scott has reviewed the specific application of occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 70 percent of occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves management retains ryder scott to provide objective thirdparty input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by occidental occidental has filed ryder scotts independent report as an exhibit to this form 10k 

based on its reviews including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current sec regulations 

 

industry outlook 

the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous current and anticipated market conditions the wti and brent oil price indexes have fluctuated throughout 2012  settling at 9182 per barrel and 11111 per barrel as of december 31 2012  

oil prices will continue to be affected by i global supply and demand which are generally a function of global economic conditions inventory levels production disruptions technological advances regional market conditions and the actions of opec other significant producers and governments ii currency exchange rates and iii the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions these factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil prices reliably occidental continues to adjust to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital 

ngl prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock in addition infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region the volatility in all of these markets makes it impossible to predict ngl prices reliably 

domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas these and other factors can cause prices to be volatile making it impossible to predict domestic gas prices reliably international gas prices are generally fixed under longterm contracts

chemical segment earnings decreased in 2012  notably because margins were lower across most product lines as price and volume declines more than offset lower feedstock costs while the overall united states economy experienced modest growth the lower margins were primarily due to weaker economic conditions in europe and asia and increased competitive activity from these regions 

business review 

basic chemicals 

during 2012  united states manufacturing sectors experienced weak growth much of the year resulting in soft domestic demand and pricing for basic chemical products industry chlorine production decreased by approximately 2 percent compared to 2011 chlorine prices decreased throughout the year due to lower chlorine demand caused by the slowdown of the chinese economy and the european debt crisis exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain remained competitive in offshore markets as a result of the north america feedstock cost advantages which are driven mostly by natural gas prices pricing for liquid caustic soda began 2012  generally 

soft because the markets anticipated increasing supply due to the improving united states economy prices improved in the last two quarters of 2012 as a result of favorable global caustic soda supply and demand balances resulting in prices finishing slightly above the prior year level businesses such as calcium chloride and potassium hydroxide were also negatively impacted by a mild winter and drought conditions in the united states 

during 2012 oxychem began construction of a 182500tonperyear membrane chloralkali plant in tennessee which it expects to begin operating in the fourth quarter of 2013 

vinyls 

demand in the domestic housing and commercial construction markets increased resulting in a yearoveryear domestic vinyl demand increase of approximately 8 percent in 2012 the higher domestic demand combined with a modest growth in exports contributed to an approximately 4percent industrywide increase in domestic operating rates compared to 2011 industry margins also increased in 2012 due to a combination of higher pvc selling prices and lower ethylene costs ethylene costs which are a significant component of pvc feedstock costs increased outside north america in 2012 due to the greater dependence on naphthabased production versus ethane in the united states north americanproduced ethylene continues to be costcompetitive versus prices in europe and asia giving north american vinyl products an advantage in global markets industrywide north american exports of pvc accounted for greater than 35 percent of the total sales of north american producers 

industry outlook 

industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy specifically in the housing construction automotive and durable goods markets margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices 

basic chemicals 

occidental expects that if the united states housing automotive and durable goods markets continue to improve domestic demand for basic chemical products should be higher in 2013 with improving demand chlorine and caustic soda margins would be expected to remain at least at 2012 levels the continued competitiveness of downstream chlorine derivatives in global markets is contingent on united states feedstock costs primarily natural gas and ethylene remaining favorable compared to other global markets 

vinyls 

north american demand and operating rates for vinyls should improve further in 2013 if growth of housing starts and commercial construction continues occidental expects export demand to remain firm and industry margins to improve as operating rates increase 

 

midstream and marketing segment 

business environment 

midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing and trading businesses and its processing transportation and power generation assets the marketing and trading businesses aggregate and market occidentals and thirdparty volumes trade oil gas and other commodities and engage in storage activities earnings related to processing and transportation are affected by the volumes that are processed at and transported through the segments plants and pipelines as well as the margins obtained on related services 

the midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2012  were comparable to 2011  and reflected improved marketing and trading performance offset by lower gas processing margins 

business review 

oil and gas marketing and trading 

the marketing and trading group markets substantially all of occidental’s oil ngls and gas production trades around its assets including transportation and storage capacity and engages in commodities trading occidental’s thirdparty marketing and trading activities focus on purchasing oil ngls and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets these purchases allow occidental to aggregate volumes to improve marketing earnings in addition occidental’s phibro trading units strategy is to profit from market price changes marketing and trading performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs the marketing and trading groups earnings increased in 2012 

gas processing plants and co 2  fields and facilities 

occidental processes its and thirdparty domestic wet gas to extract ngls and other gas byproducts including co 2  and delivers dry gas to pipelines margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for ngls occidental’s 2012  earnings from these operations decreased compared to 2011  which reflected lower ngl prices 

occidental together with adnoc is constructing a gas plant and facilities as part of the al hosn gas project in abu dhabi which is expected to be operational in 2014 

pipeline transportation 

margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped dolphin energy owns and operates a 230milelong 48inchdiameter natural gas pipeline dolphin pipeline which transports dry natural gas from qatar to the uae and oman the dolphin pipeline contributes significantly to occidentals pipeline transportation results through occidentals 245percent interest in dolphin energy the dolphin pipeline has capacity to transport up to 32 bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 23 bcf per day demand for natural gas in the uae and oman has grown and dolphin energy’s customers have requested additional 

gas supplies to help fulfill this growing demand dolphin energy will continue to pursue an agreement to secure an additional supply of gas from qatar 

occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2700 miles of pipelines from southeast new mexico across the permian basin of southwest texas to cushing oklahoma the system has a current throughput capacity of about 365000 barrels per day 58 million barrels of active storage capability and 85 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline 

occidental owns 35 percent of the general partner of plains allamerican pipeline lp plains pipeline a publicly traded oil and gas pipeline transportation storage terminalling and marketing entity in the western and southern united states and canada the plains pipeline contributed over 20 percent of the segments earnings for 2012 

occidental and magellan midstream partners lp are proceeding with the construction of the bridgetex pipeline which is expected to begin service in mid2014 the approximately 450milelong pipeline will be capable of transporting approximately 300000 barrels per day of crude oil between the permian region colorado city tx and the gulf coast refinery markets the bridgetex pipeline project also includes construction of approximately 26 million barrels of oil storage in aggregate 

occidentals 2012 pipeline transportation earnings improved due to higher volumes and pricing and higher income from plains pipeline partially offset by lower earnings from the dolphin pipeline 

power generation facilities 

earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties and are generally not material 

  

industry outlook 

the pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable the gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending mostly on ngl prices which cannot be predicted generally higher ngl prices result in higher profitability based on its framework of controls and risk management systems however occidental does not expect the volatility of these operations to be significant to the company as a whole although the marketing and the trading businesses individually can cause volatility the operations together tend to offset each other significantly reducing the overall volatility of the midstream and marketing segment 

 

segment results of operations 

segment earnings exclude income taxes interest income interest expense environmental remediation expenses unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments equity investments seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in occidentals consolidated quarterly earnings during the year 

the following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items 



 

oil and gas 

dollars in millions except as indicated 



 

the following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil ngls and natural gas per day for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012  the differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at occidental’s international locations where product is loaded onto tankers 



 





 

oil and gas segment earnings in 2012 were 71 billion compared to 102 billion in 2011 the decrease reflected asset impairments and related items lower ngl and natural gas prices and higher depreciation depletion and amortization dda rates maintenance activity and field support costs and exploration expense partially offset by higher oil prices and domestic volumes 

average production costs for 2012 excluding taxes other than on income were 1499 per boe compared to 1284 per boe for 2011 the increase reflected higher maintenance activities and field support costs the fourth quarter of 2012 production costs were 1495 per barrel which was 104 per barrel lower than the third quarter of 2012 level these reductions occurred during the course of the fourth quarter and the 2012 yearend exit rate on a per barrel basis was lower than the fourth quarter 2011 average and well below the fourth quarter 2012 level these reductions are expected to continue into 2013 reflecting planned improvements in operational efficiencies over many cost categories 

average daily oil and gas production volumes were 766000 boe for 2012 compared to 733000 boe for 2011 occidentals domestic production increased by 9 percent while total company production increased by 5 percent dolphins full cost recovery of prestartup capital which reduced production was the only operation where pscs and similar contracts had an appreciable effect on 2012 production volumes average daily sales volumes were 764000 boe in the twelve months of 2012 compared with 731000 boe for the same period in 2011 

oil and gas segment earnings in 2011 were 102 billion compared to 72 billion in 2010 the increase reflected higher oil and ngl prices and volumes partially offset by higher dda rates and higher operating costs including higher field support workover and well maintenance expenses driven by occidental’s program to increase production at current high oil prices 

average daily oil and gas production volumes were 733000 boe for 2011 compared with 711000 boe for 2010 the increase was mainly due to acquisitions in south texas california and the williston basin and higher production in oman’s mukhaizna field and iraq which were partially offset by lower production in libya production was negatively impacted in the middle eastnorth africa colombia and long beach by higher yearoveryear average oil prices affecting pscs by 18000 boe per day average daily sales volumes were 731000 boe in the twelve months of 2011 compared with 705000 boe for 2010 

oil and gas segment earnings in 2012 included pretax charges of 17 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items 

 

oil and gas segment earnings in 2011 included pretax charges of 35 million related to exploration writeoffs in libya and 29 million related to colombia net worth tax as well as a pretax gain for sale of an interest in a colombian pipeline of 22 million 

chemical 



chemical segment earnings were 720 million in 2012 compared to 861 million in 2011 the reduction was primarily the result of lower margins due to weaker economic conditions in europe and asia and increased competitive activity from these regions the calcium chloride and potassium hydroxide businesses were also negatively impacted by a mild winter and drought conditions in the united states 

chemical segment earnings were 861 million in 2011 compared to 438 million in 2010 the 2011 results reflected strong export sales and higher margins resulting from higher demand across most products 

the increase in the chemical capital expenditures was mostly due to the new chloralkali plant 

midstream marketing and other 



midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2012  were 439 million  compared to 448 million  in 2011  the 2012 results reflected lower gas processing earnings and improved marketing and trading performance 

midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2011  were 448 million  compared to 472 million  in 2010  the 2011  results reflected lower gas processing margins partially offset by improved marketing and trading performance 

the increase in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was almost entirely due to the al hosn gas project 

significant items affecting earnings 

the following table sets forth for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  significant transactions and events affecting occidental’s earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature timing and amount 



 

taxes 

deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets of 20 billion were 58 billion at december 31 2012  the current portion of the deferred tax assets of 250 million is included in other current assets the deferred tax assets net of allowances are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences 

worldwide effective tax rate 

the following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations 



 

occidental’s 2012  worldwide tax rate was 40 percent slightly higher than 2011  and comparable to 2010 due to higher proportionate foreign pretax income in 2012 the 2011  income tax expense included a net 21 million charge for outofperiod state income taxes the 2010 income tax expense included an 80 million benefit related to foreign tax credit carryforwards 

a deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries as it is occidental’s intention generally to reinvest such earnings permanently if the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested the additional deferred tax liability required would be immaterial assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits 

consolidated results of operations 

changes in components of occidentals results of operations are discussed below 

selected revenue and other income items 



the increase in net sales in 2012  compared to 2011  was due to higher oil volumes and prices partially offset by lower gas and ngl prices and lower prices and volumes across most chemical products 

the increase in net sales in 2011  compared to 2010  was due to higher oil and ngl prices higher oil and gas segment volumes and higher sales including higher export sales across most chemical products 

price and volume changes in the oil and gas segment generally represent a substantially larger portion of the overall change in net sales than the chemical and midstream and marketing segments 

selected expense items 



 cost of sales increased in 2012  compared to 2011  due to higher oil and gas volumes and operating costs mostly resulting from higher maintenance activity and field support costs partially offset by lower feedstock and energy costs in the chemical segment 

cost of sales increased in 2011  compared to 2010  due to higher oil and gas volumes higher oil and gas operating costs mostly resulting from higher workover and well maintenance activity and higher feedstock costs in the chemical segment 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2012  due to higher headcount partially offset by lower equity compensation expense and the colombia net worth tax which increased the 2011 costs 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2011  due to higher headcount and environmental remediation expense and the colombia net worth tax 

dda increased in each year from 2010  to 2012  generally due to higher dda rates and volumes in the oil and gas segment the dda rate is expected to further increase in 2013 

taxes other than on income increased in each year from 2010  to 2012  due to higher domestic oil volumes and prices and higher domestic ad valorem taxes resulting from higher property values 

asset impairments and related items in 2012  were almost all in midcontinent over 90 percent of which were related to natural gas properties that were acquired more than four years ago on average when gas prices were over 6 per mcf 

asset impairments and related items in 2010  predominately related to gas properties in the rocky mountain region 

interest and debt expense net in 2011  included the 163 million early debt extinguishment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2011  

 

selected other items 



provision for income taxes decreased in 2012  compared to 2011  due to lower pretax income partially offset by a slightly higher effective tax rate the higher tax rate was due to higher proportional foreign pretax income in 2012 compared to 2011 

provision for income taxes increased in 2011  compared to 2010  due to higher pretax income partially offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate the lower tax rate was due to higher proportional domestic pretax income in 2011  compared to 2010  

income from equity investment in 2012  was comparable to 2011  

income from equity investments increased in 2011  compared to 2010  due to an additional investment in the plains pipeline in late 2010  and its higher earnings 

discontinued operations net in 2011  included the 144 million aftertax gain recorded from the sale of the argentine operations 

there was no net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2012  and 2011  due to the restructuring of occidental’s colombian operations to take a direct working interest in the related assets as of december 31 2010 

consolidated analysis of financial position 

the changes in select components of occidental’s balance sheet are discussed below 

selected balance sheet components 



assets 

see liquidity and capital resources — cash flow analysis for discussion about the change in cash and cash equivalents 

the decrease in trade receivables net was due to lower oil and gas prices at the end of 2012 compared to the end of 2011 the increase in inventories was primarily due to higher volumes of oil in storage and materials and supplies held at the end of 2012 compared to the end of 2011 the increase in other current assets in 2012 resulted from an increase in tax receivables the decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities was mostly due to higher distributions received in the current year the increase in ppe net was due to capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and gas properties partially offset by dda and asset impairments 

liabilities and stockholders equity 

the increase in current maturities of longterm debt was due to debt maturing in 2013 the decrease in accounts payable reflected lower oil and gas prices in the marketing and trading operations during the fourth quarter of 2012 and lower oil and gas spending levels at the end of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 the decrease in accrued liabilities was mostly due to the acceleration of the fourth quarter 2012 dividend payment which normally would have been accrued as of year end but paid in the first quarter of the following year the increase in longterm debt net was due to the june 2012 issuance of 175 billion of senior unsecured notes partially offset by debt maturities that became current at the end of 2012 the increase in deferred and other domestic and foreign income taxes was mainly due to accelerated tax depreciation of the capital expenditures in 2012 the increase in stockholders equity reflected net income for 2012 partially offset by dividends and treasury stock purchases 

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2012  occidental had approximately 16 billion in cash on hand a substantial majority of which is held domestically income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segments prices and sales volumes occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs and planned capital expenditures dividends and any debt payments 

occidental has a bank credit facility credit facility with a 20 billion  commitment expiring in 2016 no amounts have been drawn under this credit facility up to 10 billion  of the credit facility is available in the form of letters of credit borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at various benchmark rates including libor plus a margin based on occidentals senior debt ratings additionally occidental paid average annual facility fees of 008 percent  in 2012 on the total commitment amounts of the credit facility 

the credit facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur the credit facility and other debt agreements do not contain 

 

material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict occidentals ability to borrow or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt 

as of december 31 2012  under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on or acquisitions of occidental stock 

occidental has a shelf registration statement that facilitates future issuances of securities in june 2012 occidental issued 175 billion  of debt which comprised 125 billion  of 270 percent senior unsecured notes due 2023 and 500 million  of 150 percent senior unsecured notes due 2018 occidental received net proceeds of approximately 174 billion  interest on the notes will be payable semiannually in arrears in february and august for each series of notes 

occidental from time to time may access and has accessed debt markets for general corporate purposes including acquisitions 

cash flow analysis 



although net income decreased by 22 billion for the twelve months ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period of 2011 net cash provided by operating activities only decreased by 10 billion for this period compared to 2011 net income in 2012 included much larger noncash charges which reduced net income but not cash provided by operating activities these noncash charges mainly comprised asset impairments and higher dda working capital changes in 2012 further reduced cash flow from operations by approximately 08 billion compared to 2011 

additionally operating cash flows in 2012 compared to 2011 reflected lower domestic gas and worldwide ngl prices by 35 percent and 19 percent respectively and higher maintenance activity and field support costs partially offset by higher domestic oil volumes and 2percent higher worldwide oil prices the positive cashflow impact of the oil price change was more than offset by the negative effect of significant declines in gas and ngl prices the decrease in operating cash flows in 2012 compared to 2011 also reflected lower chemical margins primarily due to weaker economic conditions in europe and asia 

other cost elements such as labor costs and overhead are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flow than the changes in oil prices and volumes and gas and ngl prices 

the most important sources of the increase in operating cash flow in 2011 compared to 2010 were higher worldwide oil and ngl prices and volumes in 2011 

compared to 2010 occidental’s global realized oil and ngl prices increased 30 percent and 23 percent respectively in 2011 occidental’s oil and ngl production accounted for 71 percent of its total net sales increases in field support workover and well maintenance costs in 2011 compared to 2010 partially offset the increases in prices and volumes the increase in operating cash flows in 2011 compared to 2010 also reflected high chemical product prices and margins for most products  

the impact of the chemical and the midstream and marketing segments on overall cash flows is generally less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment because the chemical and midstream and marketing segments are significantly smaller 

other noncash charges to income in 2012 2011 and 2010 included charges for stockbased compensation plans and asset retirement obligation accruals 

operating cash flows for discontinued operations include the argentine operations through the date they were sold in february 2011 



the increase in capital expenditures of 27 billion from 2011 to 2012 was mainly due to the 21 billion increase in oil and gas expenditures a majority of which was in domestic properties such as permian and california as well as increases throughout the middle east occidental’s united states average operatedrig activity increased 25 percent from 51 rigs in 2011 to 64 rigs in 2012 the rig count was 41 at the end of 2012 the increase in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was almost entirely due to the al hosn gas project 

occidental’s capital spending is expected to decrease in 2013 to approximately 96 billion and will be focused on increasing oil production and ensuring occidentals returns remain well above its costs of capital given current prices and the cost environment the reduction in capital will come entirely from the oil and gas segment almost all of which will be in occidentals domestic operations occidental expects that a meaningful portion of the capital reduction will come from efficiencies in its drilling program during the fourth quarter of 2012 occidental embarked on an efficiency program that among other things targeted a 15percent reduction in its drilling costs through the end of 2012 and early 2013 occidental believes that it has already achieved about half of the targeted savings with further improvements expected during the remainder of 2013 occidental believes it will be able to grow oil 

 

production while reducing capital expenditures because it expects much of the capital reduction to come from efficiencies and not reduced activity it expects only a modest impact on natural gas and ngl production from reduced gas drilling the midstream and marketing segment capital spending will increase mainly for the bridgetex pipeline the 2013 capital program is expected to be approximately 75 percent in oil and gas 11 percent in the al hosn gas project 9 percent in domestic midstream and marketing and the remainder in the chemical segment 

occidental expects to spend about 25 percent of its total capital expenditures on projects that will begin contributing to its earnings and cash flow over the next several years these projects include the al hosn gas project the bridgetex pipeline expansion of gas and co 2  processing plants and a new chloralkali plant in the chemical business as of december 31 2012 the accumulated balance of such project costs that will contribute to earnings in future years excluding costs of undeveloped acreage was approximately 31 billion occidental expects this balance to grow by the end of 2013 before these investments start generating returns in 2014 

the 2012 other investing activities net amount included 25 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets largely consisting of various interests in domestic oil and gas properties in the permian basin the williston basin california and south texas also included in 2012 investing activities was approximately 190 million of cash dividends received as investment returns 

the increase in capital expenditures of 36 billion from 2010 to 2011 was mainly due to the 30 billion increase in oil and gas expenditures which reflected occidental’s share of development costs in oman and bahrain and higher spending in domestic properties in california the permian basin south texas and the williston basin occidental’s united states operated rig activity increased 89 percent from 38 rigs at yearend 2010 to 72 rigs at yearend 2011 

the 2011 other investing activities net amount included 49 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets including various interests in domestic oil and gas properties in operated producing and nonproducing properties in california and the permian and williston basins for approximately 24 billion properties in south texas for 18 billion and 05 billion for occidental’s share of preacquisition development expenditures incurred by the al hosn gas project 

the 2010 other investing activities net amount included 49 billion in cash payments for the acquisitions of businesses and assets including acquisitions of various interests in domestic oil and gas properties in operated producing and nonproducing properties in the permian basin midcontinent region and california for approximately 25 billion properties in north dakota for approximately 14 billion additional interests in plains pipeline for approximately 430 million and the remaining 50percent interest in ehp for approximately 175 million as well as foreign contract payments of approximately 225 million 

investing cash flow from discontinued operations included 26 billion of cash received from the sale of the argentine operations in 2011 and capital expenditures of 310 million in 2010 

commitments at december 31 2012  for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures were approximately 22 billion  which will be due in 2013 and beyond occidental expects to fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations 



the 2012 net cash used by financing activities included net proceeds of approximately 17 billion from the june 2012 issuance of senior unsecured notes common stock dividends paid increased by 07 billion to 21 billion in 2012 which included the accelerated payment of the fourth quarter dividend in addition purchases of treasury stock increased from 274 million in 2011 to 583 million 

the 2011 amount included net proceeds of approximately 21 billion from the august 2011 issuance of senior unsecured notes and financing cash flow use of 15 billion to retire other longterm debt common stock dividends paid increased from 11 billion in 2010 to 14 billion in 2011 in addition purchases of treasury stock increased from 67 million in 2010 to 274 million in 2011 

the 2010 amount included net proceeds of approximately 26 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and financing cash flow use of 311 million to retire other longterm debt 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of occidentals offbalancesheet arrangements 

guarantees 

occidental has guaranteed certain equity investees debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds letters of credit indemnities and commitments provided by occidental to third parties mainly to provide assurance that opc or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees as of december 31 2012  occidental’s guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately 370 million  of dolphin’s debt for which the fair value was immaterial 

see oil and gas segment — business review — qatar and “segment results of operations” for further information about dolphin 

leases 

occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements mainly for transportation equipment power plants machinery terminals storage facilities land and office space occidental leases assets when leasing offers greater operating flexibility lease payments are generally expensed as part of cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses for more information see contractual obligations 

 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes and crossreferences occidental’s contractual obligations this summary indicates on and offbalancesheet obligations as of december 31 2012  



 

delivery commitments 

occidental has made commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver a portion of its oil gas and ngl production the total amount contracted to be delivered a substantial majority of which is in the united states is approximately 65 million barrels of oil through 2019 73 billion cubic feet of gas through 2016 and 3 million barrels of ngls through 2013 the price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and none of the commitments in any given year are material in addition occidental has the ability to secure additional volumes in the case of a shortfall 

lawsuits claims and contingencies 

opc or certain of its subsidiaries are involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property damage or other losses punitive damages civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief opc or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar federal state local and foreign environmental laws these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties and injunctive relief usually opc or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies further some lawsuits claims and legal proceedings involve acquired assets with respect to which third parties retain liability or indemnify occidental for conditions that existed prior to purchase 

occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters reserve balances for other matters as of december 31 2012  and 2011  were not material to occidentals consolidated balance sheets occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations environmental matters are further discussed under the caption environmental liabilities and expenditures below 

on october 5 2012 an arbitral tribunal of the international centre for settlement of investment disputes icsid an agency of the world bank found that ecuador violated the united states  ecuador bilateral investment treaty in 2006 when it terminated occidental’s block 15 concession the tribunal ordered ecuador to pay 177 billion plus interest in damages ecuador has filed an application asking icsid to annul the damage award it could take over a year for icsid to rule on ecuador’s application for annulment pursuant to a 2000 farmout agreement andes petroleum is entitled to 40 of any net amount which occidental recovers from ecuador in this icsid proceeding the effect if any on the financial statements will be recognized upon final resolution of this matter 

during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax jurisdictions although taxable years through 2009 for united states federal income tax purposes have been audited by the united states internal revenue service irs pursuant to 

 

its compliance assurance program subsequent taxable years are currently under review additionally in december 2012 occidental filed united states federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 which are subject to irs review taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions in certain of these jurisdictions tax authorities are in various stages of auditing occidentals income taxes during the course of tax audits disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 

opc its subsidiaries or both have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2012  occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality occidental’s environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in the future occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand

the laws that require or address environmental remediation including cercla and similar federal state local and foreign laws may apply retroactively and regardless of fault the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites opc or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating closed and thirdparty sites remedial activities may include one or more of the following investigation involving sampling modeling risk assessment or monitoring cleanup measures including removal treatment or disposal or operation and maintenance of remedial systems the environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages civil penalties injunctive relief and government oversight costs 

as of december 31 2012  occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 161  sites the following table presents occidental’s environmental remediation reserves as of december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the us environmental protection 

agency on the cercla national priorities list npl sites and three categories of nonnpl sites — thirdparty sites occidentaloperated sites and closed or nonoperated occidental sites 



as of december 31 2012  occidental’s environmental reserves exceeded  10 million  each at 12  of the 161  sites described above and 112  of the sites had reserves from 0 to  1 million  each 

as of december 31 2012  two  landfills in western new york owned by occidental accounted for 73 percent of its reserves associated with npl sites in connection with a 1986 acquisition maxus energy corporation has retained the liability and indemnified occidental for 14  of the remaining npl sites 

as of december 31 2012  maxus has also retained the liability and indemnified occidental for 8  of the 75  thirdparty sites two  of the remaining 67  thirdparty sites — a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee and a containment and removal project in tennessee — accounted for 43 percent  of occidental’s reserves associated with these sites 

five  sites — chemical plants in kansas louisiana texas and new york and a group of oil and gas properties in the southwestern united states — accounted for 70 percent  of the reserves associated with the occidentaloperated sites 

three  other sites — former chemical plants in tennessee and delaware and a closed coal mine in pennsylvania — accounted for 55 percent  of the reserves associated with closed or nonoperated occidental sites 

environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation the following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years 



based on current estimates occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next four  years and the balance at these 

 

sites over the subsequent 10  or more years occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to  375 million  see critical accounting policies and estimates — environmental liabilities and expenditures for additional information 

occidental’s environmental costs some of which include estimates are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended december 31 



operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures relate to longerlived improvements in currently operating properties remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations 

occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately  130 million  for 2013 

foreign investments 

many of occidental’s assets are located outside north america at december 31 2012  the carrying value of occidental’s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately 123 billion  or approximately 19 percent of occidental’s total assets at that date of such assets approximately 106 billion are located in the middle eastnorth africa and approximately 16 billion are located in latin america for the year ended december 31 2012  net sales outside north america totaled 88 billion  or approximately 36 percent of total net sales 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires occidentals management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts there has been no material change to occidentals critical accounting policies over the past three years the selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve managements judgment 

oil and gas properties 

the carrying value of occidental’s property plant and equipment ppe represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest net of accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization dda and net of any impairment charges for assets acquired ppe cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets 

occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found if proved reserves have been found the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized otherwise occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense in some cases a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12month period after drilling is complete 

occidental expenses annual lease rentals and geological geophysical and seismic costs as incurred 

occidental expenses the costs of injectants used in production 

occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unitofproduction method it amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves 

proved oil and gas reserves as defined in the securities and exchange commissions regulation sx rule 410a are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 

several factors could change occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves for example occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices in other cases particularly with longlived properties lower product prices 

 

may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical for such properties higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded in 2012  revisions of previous estimates provided a net 183 million boe reduction to proved reserves which amounted to less than 6 percent of occidentals total reserves as of december 31 2012  

in 2012 revisions related to price for the company as a whole were negative a substantial majority of such revisions related to occidentals domestic gas reserves and resulted from lower domestic gas prices these lower prices and the resulting changes in occidentals plans for drilling on gas properties constituted a majority of its total revisions to the extent gas prices recover in the future a portion of these reserves will be reinstated if natural gas prices decrease further for an extended period domestic gas reserves could experience additional negative price revisions 

the most significant financial statement effect from a change in occidentals oil and gas reserves would be to the dda rate for example a 5percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the dda rate by approximately 080 per barrel which would increase or decrease pretax income by approximately 225 million annually at current production rates the change in the dda rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial 

a portion of the carrying value of occidental’s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties at december 31 2012  the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were 48 billion the unproved amounts are not subject to dda until they are classified as proved properties as exploration and development work progresses if reserves on these properties are proved capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to dda if the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful or managements plans changed with respect to these properties as a result of economic operating or contractual conditions the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed the timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties if warranted depends upon managements plans the nature timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance 

additionally occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties generally when prices decline other than temporarily reserve estimates change significantly or other significant events occur that may 

impact its ability to realize the recorded asset amounts impairment tests incorporate a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time these assumptions include estimates of future product prices which occidental bases on forward price curves and when applicable contractual prices estimates of oil and gas reserves and estimates of future expected operating and development costs 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 impairment charges totaling 17 billion pretax were taken on certain proved and unproved properties almost all of the charges were for certain properties in midcontinent over 90 percent of which were related to natural gas properties that were acquired more than four years ago on average when gas prices were more than 6 per mcf these properties were impacted by persistently low natural gas prices in the united states changing managements development plans and negative reserve revisions due to recent well performance any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value any further sustained declines in gas prices as well as significant sustained reductions in the prices of other products may result in additional impairments in the future 

chemical assets 

occidentals chemical assets are depreciated using either the unitofproduction or the straightline method based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets which range from three years to 50 years are also used for impairment tests the estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance as well as planned major maintenance activities pmma ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred pmma costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul additionally occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use these capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service the resulting revision if any of the asset’s estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively 

without these continued expenditures the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition demand feedstock costs energy prices environmental regulations and technological changes 

 

occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

occidentals net ppe for the chemical segment is approximately 26 billion and its depreciation expense for 2013  is expected to be approximately 300 million the most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical plants would be on depreciation expense for example a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pretax earnings by approximately 45 million per year 

midstream marketing and other assets 

derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cashflow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment otherwise any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period for cashflow hedges the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income oci with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged realized gains or losses from cashflow hedges and any ineffective portion are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income ineffectiveness is primarily created by a basis difference between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location quality or grade of the physical commodity transactions gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income there were no fair value hedges as of and during the year ended december 31 2012  

a hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if at inception and throughout its life it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows respectively of the hedging instrument in the case of hedging a forecast transaction the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable 

occidentals midstream and marketing ppe is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using either the unitofproduction or straightline method occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the assets net book value over its estimated fair value 

fair value measurements 

occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a threelevel fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation techniques level 1 – using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 – using observable inputs other than quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities and level 3 – using unobservable inputs transfers between levels if any are recognized at the end of each reporting period 

fair values  recurring 

occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs occidental utilizes the midpoint price between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value in addition to using market data occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique for assets and liabilities carried at fair value occidental measures fair value using the following methods 



 

 occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a marketobservable price for an identical or similar asset or liability this approach utilizes managements judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows and discounts those cash flows using a riskadjusted discount rate 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate occidental records environmental reserves for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience remedial objectives available technologies applicable laws and regulations and costsharing arrangements occidental bases environmental reserves on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred using the most costeffective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established the reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established the amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received or when receipt of recovery is highly probable as of december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  occidental did not have any accruals for reimbursements or recoveries 

many factors could affect occidental’s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses the most significant are 1 cost estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate 2 the length of time type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination 3 a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify occidental’s proposed remedial plan 4 improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs 5 laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability and 6 changes in allocation or costsharing arrangements 

certain sites involve multiple parties with various costsharing arrangements which fall into the following three categories 1 environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties 2 oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest or 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of properties in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs in these circumstances occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate when estimating occidentals ultimate share of liability occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and based on these factors believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved 

in addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures which often take in excess of 10 years at npl sites occidental’s reserves include management’s estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly 

if occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings for example if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent occidental would record a pretax gain of 34 million if the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 34 million 

other loss contingencies 

occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits claims proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis 

loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate management’s judgments could change based on new information changes in or interpretations of laws or regulations changes in management’s plans or intentions opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings or other factors see lawsuits claims and other contingencies for additional information 

 

significant accounting and disclosure changes 

listed below are significant recently adopted accounting and disclosure changes 

fair value measurements 

beginning in the quarter ended march 31 2012 occidental enhanced its fair value measurement application and disclosures as a result of adopting new requirements issued by the financial accounting standards board in may 2011 the new rules include revisions to the standards for the use of fair value measurements and additional disclosures for i all transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy ii level 3 measurements and iii hierarchy classifications used for assets and liabilities whose fair value is disclosed only in the footnotes the new rules did not have a material impact on occidental 

derivative activities and market risk 

commodity price risk 

general 

occidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil ngl and natural gas prices price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect occidental’s pretax annual income by approximately 150 million  for a 1 per barrel change in oil prices and 30 million  for a 1 per barrel change in ngl prices if domestic natural gas prices varied by 050 per mcf it would have an estimated annual effect on occidentals pretax income of approximately 115 million  these pricechange sensitivities include the impact of psc and similar contract volume changes on income if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidental’s results to oil and gas prices also will change the marketing and trading results are also sensitive to price changes of oil gas and to a lesser degree other commodities these sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing and trading volumes and cannot be predicted reliably 

occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices a variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of 10 per ton would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 10 million  and 30 million  respectively a variation in pvc prices of 001  per lb would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 25 million  historically over time product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins according to chemical market associates inc december 2012 average contract prices were chlorine— 255 per ton caustic soda— 635 per ton and pvc— 056 per lb 

occidental uses derivative instruments including a combination of shortterm futures forwards options and swaps to establish as of the date of production the price it receives and to improve realized prices for oil and gas occidental only occasionally hedges its oil and gas production and when it does so the volumes are usually insignificant additionally occidental’s phibro trading unit engages in trading activities using derivatives for the 

purpose of generating profits mainly from market price changes of commodities 

risk manage me nt 

occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy the controls under this policy are implemented and enforced by certain members of management embedded in the marketing and trading operations in order to manage risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check these members of management report to the corporate vice president and treasurer the president and chief executive officer and risk committees comprising members of occidentals senior corporate management also oversee these controls controls for these activities include limits on value at risk limits on credit limits on total notional trade value segregation of duties delegation of authority daily price verifications daily reporting to senior management of positions together with various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls additionally these operations maintain highly liquid positions as a result of which the market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice 

fair value of marketing and trading derivative contracts 

occidentals marketing and trading derivative contracts are carried at fair value and result from thirdparty marketing and trading activities sales of its production and activities to generate profits mainly from price changes in the commodities markets 

the following table shows the fair value of occidentals derivatives excluding collateral segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation 



note  includes cashflow hedges further discussed below 

cashflow hedges 

occidental entered into financial swap agreements in november 2012 for the sale of a portion of its natural gas production in california these swap agreements hedge 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day beginning in january 2013 through march 2014 and qualify as cashflow hedges the weightedaverage strike price of these swaps is 430 

through march 31 2012 occidental held financial swap agreements related to the sale of 50 million  cubic feet per day of its existing natural gas production from the rocky mountain region of the united states that qualified as cashflow hedges at a weightedaverage strike price of 607  

through 2011  occidental held a series of collar agreements for 12000  barrels of oil per day of its domestic production that qualified as cashflow hedges at a 

 

weightedaverage strike price that ranged from 3292  to 4635  

occidental’s marketing and trading operations store natural gas purchased from third parties at occidental’s north american leased storage facilities derivative instruments are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes through march 31 2013 as of december 31 2012  and 2011  occidental had approximately 20  billion cubic feet and 25  billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage respectively as of december 31 2012  and 2011  occidental had cashflow hedges for the forecast sale to be settled by physical delivery of approximately 20  billion cubic feet and 35  billion cubic feet of this stored natural gas respectively 

as of december 31 2012  the total fair value of cashflow hedges which was a net asset of 9 million  was included in the total fair value table in fair value of marketing and trading derivative contracts above 

quantitative information 

occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commoditybased and foreign currency derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities this method determines the maximum potential negative shortterm change in fair value with at least a 95percent level of confidence additionally occidental uses trading limits including among others limits on total notional trade value and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized on short notice as a result of these controls occidental has determined that the market risk of the marketing and trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on it 

interest rate risk 

general 

occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates is not expected to be material and relates to its variablerate longterm debt obligations as of december 31 2012  variablerate debt constituted approximately 1 percent of occidentals total debt 

tabular presentation of interest rate risk 

the table below provides information about occidentals debt obligations debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date 





credit risk 

occidentals credit risk relates primarily to its derivative financial instruments and trade receivables occidental’s contracts are spread among a large number of counterparties creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis and master netting arrangements are used when appropriate credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances current activity and forward marktomarket exposure 

a substantial portion of occidental’s derivative transaction volume is executed through exchangetraded contracts which are subject to nominal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions is settled on a daily margin basis with select clearinghouses and brokers occidental executes the rest of its derivative transactions in the otc market occidental is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments occidental manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong by spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties by entering into master netting arrangements with the counterparties and by requiring collateral as appropriate occidental actively monitors the creditworthiness of each counterparty and records valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty risk if necessary 

certain of occidentals otc derivative instruments contain creditriskcontingent features primarily tied to credit ratings for occidental or its counterparties which may affect the amount of collateral that each would need to post as of december 31 2012  and 2011  occidental had a net liability of 34 million  and 58 million  respectively which are net of collateral posted of 64 million  and 27 million  respectively occidental believes that if it had received a onenotch reduction in its credit ratings it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateralposting requirements as of december 31 2012  and 2011  

as of december 31 2012  the substantial majority of the credit exposures was with investment grade counterparties occidental believes its exposure to creditrelated losses at december 31 2012  was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented 

foreign currency risk 

occidental’s foreign operations have limited currency risk occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes a vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in united states dollars additionally all of occidental’s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the united states dollar as the functional currency as of december 31 2012  the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the trading operations was immaterial the effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income

 item 1a risk factors 

volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affects occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products particularly oil and gas 

changes in consumption patterns global and local economic conditions inventory levels production disruptions the actions of opec currency exchange rates worldwide drilling and exploration activities technological developments weather geophysical and technical limitations and other matters affect the supply and demand dynamics of oil and gas which along with the effect of changes in market perceptions contribute to price unpredictability and volatility 

demand and consequently the price obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the united states and global economies as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

 

occidental’s oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its results of operations and its ability to grow production and replace reserves 

results of operations reserves replacement and growth in oil and gas production depend in part on occidental’s ability to profitably acquire develop or find additional reserves occidental has many competitors including national oil companies some of which are i larger and better funded ii may be willing to accept greater risks or iii have special competencies competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts during periods of low product prices any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts 

 

occidental may experience delays cost overruns losses or unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities 

occidental bears the risks of development delays and cost overruns due to approval delays for drilling and other permits equipment failures construction delays escalating costs or competition for services materials supplies or labor property or border disputes disappointing reservoir performance and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns 

 

exploration is inherently risky exploration is subject to delays misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses 

 

governmental actions and political instability may affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s businesses are subject to the decisions of many governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 

 

occidental may experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its foreign operations are located in countries occasionally affected by political instability armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production comes from foreign sources 

 

occidental faces risks associated with its acquisitions and divestitures 

occidental’s acquisition and divestiture activities carry risks that it may i not fully realize anticipated benefits due to lessthanexpected reserves or production or changed circumstances such as product prices ii bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties iii experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity or iv assume or retain liabilities that are greater than anticipated 

 

occidental’s oil and gas reserves are based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

calculations of oil and gas reserves depend on estimates concerning reservoir characteristics and recoverability including production decline rates and operating performance as well as capital and operating costs if occidental were required to make unanticipated significant negative reserve revisions its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected 

 

  

  

  

  

concerns about climate change may affect occidental’s operations 

there is an ongoing effort to assess and quantify the effects of climate change and the potential human influences on climate the us federal government and the states of california and new mexico have adopted and other jurisdictions are considering legislation regulations or policies that seek to control or reduce the production use or emissions of “greenhouse gases” ghg to control or reduce the production or consumption of fossil fuels and to increase the use of renewable or alternative energy sources california’s capandtrade program is moving into the implementation phase the us environmental protection agency has begun to regulate certain ghg emissions from both stationary and mobile sources the uncertain outcome and timing of existing and proposed international national and state measures make it difficult to predict their business impact however occidental could face risks of delays in development projects increases in costs and taxes and reductions in the demand for and restrictions on the use of its products as a result of ongoing ghg reduction efforts 

 

occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic events 

the occurrence of events such as earthquakes hurricanes floods well blowouts fires explosions chemical releases industrial accidents physical or cyber attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect occidental’s businesses and the communities in which it operates thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses

 item 1a risk factors tableend 

volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affects occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s financial results typically correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products 

changes in consumption patterns global and local economic conditions inventory levels production disruptions the actions of opec currency exchange rates market speculation worldwide drilling and exploration activities weather geophysical and technical limitations and other matters may affect the supply and demand dynamics of oil and gas contributing to price volatility 

demand and consequently the price obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the united states and global economy as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

 

occidental’s oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its results of operations and its ability to grow production and replace reserves 

growth in occidental’s oil and gas production and results of operations depends in part on its ability to profitably acquire develop or find additional reserves occidental replaces significant amounts of its reserves through acquisitions exploration and large development projects occidental has many competitors including national oil companies some of which are larger and better funded may be willing to accept greater risks or have special competencies competition for reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of expected reserve replacement efforts cash conservation considerations during periods of low product prices may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts 

 

governmental actions political instability and labor unrest may affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s businesses are subject to the decisions of many governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 

 

 

 

occidental may experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its foreign operations are located in countries occasionally affected by political instability armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production comes from foreign sources 

 

occidental’s oil and gas reserves are based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

calculations of oil and gas reserves depend on estimates concerning reservoir characteristics and recoverability as well as capital and operating costs if occidental were required to make unanticipated significant negative reserve revisions its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected 

 

occidental may incur significant losses in exploration activities or delays or cost overruns in development efforts 

exploration is inherently risky exploration and development activities are subject to misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses occidental bears the risks of project delays and cost overruns due to equipment failures approval delays construction delays escalating costs for materials and labor border disputes and other associated risks in its development efforts 

 

occidental faces risks associated with its mergers and acquisitions 

occidentals merger and acquisition activities carry risks that it may not fully realize anticipated benefits 

 

concerns about climate change or energy dependence may affect occidental’s operations or results of operations 

there is an ongoing scientific effort to assess and quantify the effects of climate change and the potential human influences on climate related efforts by various us and foreign jurisdictions to propose or adopt legislation regulations or policies some of which have been adopted seek to control or reduce emissions of “greenhouse gases” or consumption of fossil fuels although the effect of these efforts on occidental is uncertain occidental faces risks of delays in new or expanded development projects increases in taxes increases in costs to produce and reductions in the demand for and restrictions on the use of its products 

 

  

  

  

occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic events 

the occurrence of events such as earthquakes hurricanes floods well blowouts fires explosions chemical releases industrial accidents and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may affect occidental’s businesses and communities in which it operates thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses

 item 1a risk factors 

volatile global commodity pricing strongly affects occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s financial results typically correlate closely to the volatile prices it obtains for its commodities drilling and exploration activity levels inventory levels production disruptions the actions of opec competing fuel prices prevailing currency exchange rates price speculation changes in consumption patterns weather and geophysical and technical limitations and other matters discussed in this item affect the supply of oil and gas and contribute to price volatility 

demand and consequently the price obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the united states and global economy as well as chemical industry expansion cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

occidental’s oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its profitability and its ability to grow production and replace reserves 

occidental’s future oil and gas production and its results of operations depend in part on its ability to profitably acquire develop or find additional reserves occidental replaces significant amounts of its reserves through acquisitions and large development projects occidental has many competitors some of which are larger and better funded may be willing to accept greater risks or have special competencies industry competition for reserves may influence occidental to 

 in addition rising exploration and development activity in the industry generally increases the competition for and costs of and delays access to services and supplies needed for production 

governmental actions and political instability may affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s businesses are subject to the decisions of many governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 

 occidental may experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its foreign operations are located in countries occasionally affected by political instability armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems restrictions on production equipment imports and sanctions that prevent continued operations exposure to such risks may increase as a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production comes from foreign sources 

occidental’s businesses may experience uninsured catastrophic events 

the occurrence of natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods and events such as well blowouts oilfield fires industrial accidents and other events that cause operations to cease may affect occidental’s businesses thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses 

occidental’s reserves are based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

calculations of reserves depend on estimates concerning reservoir characteristics and recoverability as well as oil and gas prices capital costs and operating costs if occidental were required to make unanticipated significant negative reserve revisions its prospects and stock price could be adversely affected 

occidental may incur significant losses in exploration or cost overruns in development efforts 

occidental may misinterpret geologic or engineering data encounter unexpected geologic conditions or find reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses on exploration or development efforts occidental bears the risks of project delays and cost overruns due to escalating costs for materials and labor equipment failures approval delays construction delays border disputes and other associated risks 

occidental faces risks associated with its mergers acquisitions and divestitures 

occidental’s merger acquisition and divestiture activities carry risks that it may not fully realize anticipated benefits due to delays miscalculate reserves or production or experience changed circumstances bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity assume or retain liabilities that are greater than anticipated or be unable to resell acquired assets as planned or at planned prices

strategy 

general 

in this report occidental refers to occidental petroleum corporation a delaware corporation opc andor one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest subsidiaries occidental’s business is divided into two segments conducted through oil and gas subsidiaries and their affiliates and chemical subsidiaries and their affiliates occidental aims to generate superior total returns to stockholders using the following strategy 

 occidental prefers to own large longlived legacy oil and gas assets like those in california and the permian basin that tend to have moderate decline rates enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to costeffective production management expects such assets to contribute substantially to earnings and cash flow after invested capital 

at occidental maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate abovecostofcapital returns throughout the business cycle during periods of high commodity prices occidental expects to use most of its cash flow after capital expenditures to enhance stockholders returns by continuing its program for evaluating dividend increases and potential stock repurchases 

the chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy capital is expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound way to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to improve the competitiveness of these assets asset acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chloralkali and polyvinyl chloride pvc businesses historically the chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure requirements

the oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for finding and development among the lowest in the industry the oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by 

 over the past several years occidental has strengthened its asset base within each of the core areas occidental has invested in and disposed of assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets see oil and gas segment — business review for a discussion of these changes 

in addition occidental has continued to make capital contributions and investments in the dolphin project in qatar and the united arab emirates uae the mukhaizna project in oman and libya for continued growth opportunities 

occidental’s overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its strategy to enhance the development of mature fields beginning with the acquisition of the elk hills oil and gas field in california in 1998 followed by a series of purchases in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico and the integration of vintage petroleum inc vintage and plains exploration and production company plains operations acquired in 2006 

at the end of 2007 the elk hills and permian assets made up 66 percent of occidental’s consolidated proven oil reserves and 44 percent of its consolidated proven gas reserves on a barrels of oil equivalent boe basis these assets accounted for 61 percent of occidental’s consolidated reserves in 2007 the combined production from these assets averaged approximately 286000 barrels of oil equivalent boe per day

occidentals share of 2007 production from its colombia operations was 37000 boe per day and proved reserves reported for these interests totaled 57 million boe at the end of 2007 

productionsharing contracts 

occidental conducts its operations in qatar oman and yemen under pscs and under such contracts receives a share of production and reserves to recover its costs and an additional share for profit in addition occidentals share of production and reserves from thums and tidelands are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 

proved reserves 

proved reserves  evaluation and review process 

a senior corporate officer of occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data in addition a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee has been established consisting of senior corporate officers to monitor and review occidentals oil and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidentals board of directors periodically throughout the year occidental has retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum engineering consultants to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes since 2003 

again in 2007 ryder scott has compared occidental’s methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry standards and has reviewed certain data methods and procedures used in estimating reserves volumes the economic evaluations and reserves classifications ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of occidental’s total reserves portfolio in 2007 ryder scott reviewed approximately 10 percent of occidental’s oil and gas reserves since being engaged in 2003 ryder scott has reviewed occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 57 percent of occidental’s reported oil and gas reserves 

based on this review including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott has concluded that the methodologies used by occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current securities and exchange commission sec standards ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes reported by occidental 

proved reserve additions 

occidentals consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at yearend 2007 of 2866 million boe as compared with the yearend 2006 amount of 2833 million boe the increase in the consolidated subsidiaries’ reserves from all sources was 242 million boe which was comprised of an increase of 297 million boe from proved developed reserves partially offset by a decrease of 55 million boe from proved undeveloped reserves 

proved developed reserves represented approximately 80 percent of occidental’s total proved reserves at yearend 2007 compared to 78 percent at yearend 2006 

proved reserve additions  consolidated subsidiaries  2007 

 proved reserves consisted of 78 percent crude oil and condensate and 22 percent natural gas 

revisions of previous estimates 

in 2007 occidental experienced a reduction of 95 million boe of proved reserves through negative revisions of previous estimates primarily in the dolphin project qatar elk hills thums and argentina partially offset by positive revisions in permian and hugoton oil price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental for example if oil prices increased by 5 per barrel less oil volume is required to recover costs and pscs would reduce occidentals share of proved reserves by approximately 8 million boe conversely if oil prices dropped by 5 per barrel occidentals share of proved reserves would increase by a similar amount oil price changes also tend to affect the economic lives of proved reserves from other contracts in a manner partially offsetting the psc reserve volume changes apart from the effects of product prices occidental believes its approach to interpreting technical data regarding oil and gas reserves makes it more likely future reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative 

improved recovery 

in 2007 occidental added reserves of 253 million boe through improved recovery in the united states improved recovery additions were 64 million boe in the elk hills field 52 million boe in the permian basin and 29 million boe in western colorado foreign additions included 32 million boe in oman 17 million boe in colombia and 15 million boe in qatar the elk hills operations employ infill drilling and both gas flood and water flood techniques in the permian basin the increased reserves were primarily attributable to enhanced recovery techniques such as drilling additional co 2 flood and water flood wells 

extensions and discoveries 

occidental obtains reserve additions from extensions and discoveries which are dependent on successful exploitation programs in 2007 as a result of such programs occidental added reserves of 24 million boe including 15 million boe in argentina 3 million boe in oman and 2 million boe in the permian basin 

the success of improved recovery extension and discovery projects depends on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements as well as oil and gas prices capital costs and operating costs many of these factors are outside of managements control and will affect whether or not these historical sources of reserve additions continue at similar levels 

purchases of proved reserves 

in 2007 occidental purchased reserves of 60 million boe of which 50 million boe were in the united states and 10 million boe were in the middle eastnorth africa occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable acquisitions are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil and gas contracts at attractive terms as market conditions change the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly 

proved undeveloped reserves 

occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 202 million boe resulting from improved recovery extensions and discoveries and purchases primarily in the elk hills field the permian basin oman and argentina elk hills provided 19 percent of this increase these proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by reserve transfers to the proved developed category as a result of 2007 development programs the dolphin project transferred 101 million boe to the proved developed category during 2007 with no remaining undeveloped reserves at year end in the united states the elk hills field and the permian basin each transferred 21 million boe into proved developed reserves from proved undeveloped reserves 

industry outlook 

the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather inventory levels competing fuel prices overall demand and the availability of supply 

worldwide oil prices rose throughout 2007 and reached historical highs during the last half of the year continued economic growth resulting in increased demand and concerns about supply availability could result in continued high prices a lower demand growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices 

oil prices have significantly affected profitability and returns for occidental and other upstream producers oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty the wti price has averaged approximately 38 per barrel over the past ten years however the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations in prices see the oil and gas segment — business environment section above for further information 

while local supplydemand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term daytoday prices may be more volatile in the futures markets such as on the nymex and other exchanges making it difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence over the last ten years the nymex gas price has averaged approximately 503 per mcf 

chemical segment 

business environment 

the chemical segment results decreased in 2007 due to the softening united states housing market and continued high feedstock costs which led to lower margins in the pvc business this was partially offset by an increase in demand for united states products in export markets in 2007 aided by expanding international economies along with favorable foreign currency exchange rates 

business review 

basic chemicals 

during 2007 demand and pricing for basic chemical products generally remained strong although demand for domestic chlorine slightly weakened compared to 2006 due to a slowdown in the united states housing sector domestic industry demand for liquid caustic soda in 2007 was virtually flat compared to the prior year however industry export demand increased over 2006 export demand was supported by increasing alumina capacity in south america as well as favorable currency exchange rates margins in 2007 continued at 2006 levels as pricing and feedstock costs remained relatively unchanged pricing for liquid caustic soda started the year strong and increased every quarter of 2007 aided by unplanned global supply disruptions and a strong export market oxychem’s chloralkali operating rate for 2007 was 92 percent which was the same as the industry average operating rate for 2007 

vinyls 

domestic demand for pvc in 2007 was 5 percent below 2006 as a result of the significant slump in housing this was partially offset by exports from the united states which were up 40 percent in 2007 over 2006 resulting in overall demand for pvc being down 2 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 margins in 2007 decreased as price increases were not able to compensate for raw material cost increases from early 2007 to the end of the year industry pvc prices increased by 31 percent while the cost of ethylene increased by 56 percent oxychem operated its pvc facilities at an average operating rate of 78 percent for 2007 compared to the north american industry average of 85 percent 

industry outlook 

in 2007 occidentals chemical business earnings were lower than 2006 primarily due to the weakening of the united states housing market 

future performance will depend on the recovery of united states construction activity global economic activity the competitiveness of the united states in the world economy feedstock and energy pricing and the impact of additional production capacity entering the market place 

basic chemicals 

forecasts of a slowing united states economy offset by a continued strong export market in 2008 are expected to result in demand levels similar to 2007 levels despite continued pressure on the vinyls market margins in 2008 are expected to remain similar to 2007 but could weaken in the second half due to the anticipated impact of capacity additions in mid 2008 

vinyls 

industrywide pvc operating rates are expected to be lower in 2008 as a result of weak demand especially in housing coupled with the startup of new capacity in the first half of the year exports of united states produced products are expected to maintain their competitive advantage due to the weak united states dollar cost pressures are also expected to continue due to high feedstock costs 

corporate and other 

corporate and other includes investments in two cogeneration facilities in taft louisiana and ingleside texas and two common carrier pipelines in the permian basin one of which was purchased in 2007 which are used in corporatedirected activities 

in 2007 occidental resolved certain legal disputes that resulted in a gain of approximately 112 million 

on august 1 2006 occidental effected a twoforone stock split in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders of record as of that date with distribution of the shares on august 15 2006 all share and per share amounts discussed and disclosed in this annual report on form 10k reflect the effect of the stock split 

in october 2006 occidental sold 10 million shares of lyondell chemical companys lyondell common stock in a registered public offering for a pretax gain of 90 million and gross proceeds of 250 million in 2007 occidental sold all of its remaining shares of lyondell common stock approximately 21 million shares for a pretax gain of 326 million and gross proceeds of 672 million

the following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items 

in millions except per share amounts 

  oil and gas 

in millions except as indicated 

 see footnotes on next page 

oil and gas continued 

  oil and gas segment earnings in 2007 were 83 billion compared to 69 billion in 2006 oil and gas segment earnings in 2007 include an aftertax gain of 412 million from the sale of occidental’s interest in a russian joint venture an aftertax gain of 112 million from certain litigation settlements a pretax gain of 103 million from the sale of exploration properties a pretax gain of 35 million from the sale of miscellaneous domestic oil and gas interests and a 74 million pretax loss from the impairment of properties in addition to the matters discussed above oil and gas segment earnings for 2007 compared to 2006 reflected higher crude oil prices and higher oil and gas production partially offset by increased depreciation depletion and amortization dda rates and higher operating and exploration expenses 

oil and gas segment earnings in 2006 were 69 billion compared to 57 billion in 2005 the increase in oil and gas segment earnings was primarily due to higher crude oil prices and oil and gas production partially offset by higher operating expenses including increased dda which was driven by higher volumes and rates 

average consolidated production costs for 2007 were 1287 per boe compared to the average 2006 production cost of 1170 per boe the increases resulted from higher field operating and maintenance costs 

chemical 

 chemical segment earnings in 2007 were 601 million compared to 906 million in 2006 the decrease in segment earnings is primarily due to lower margins in pvc 

chemical segment earnings in 2006 were 906 million compared to 614 million in 2005 the increase in chemical segment earnings is primarily due to higher margins in chlorine caustic soda and pvc 

significant items affecting earnings

the following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations 

  occidental’s 2007 worldwide effective tax rate was 41 percent the decrease in the income tax rate in 2007 compared to 2006 resulted from lower taxes on the 2007 sale of certain properties 

occidentals 2006 worldwide effective tax rate was 44 percent the lower income tax rate for reported income in 2005 compared to 2006 resulted from a 335 million 2005 tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required and a 619 million 2005 tax benefit resulting from a closing agreement with the irs resolving certain foreign tax credit issues 

consolidated results of operations 

selected revenue items

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to 2007 severance charges higher production taxes and higher stockbased and incentive compensation expense the increase in stockbased and incentive compensation expense in 2007 compared to 2006 resulted from a 58percent increase in occidentals stock price and higher net income which increased the performance measures used to value certain of the existing stockbased awards partially offset by a decrease in the value of awards granted in 2007 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher crude oil and natural gas production taxes and increases in stockbased and incentive compensation expense 

dda increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased production mainly from the dolphin project and higher costs of new reserve additions resulting in a higher dda rate 

dda increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to increased production mainly from the vintage acquisition and higher costs of new reserve additions resulting in a higher dda rate 

the increase in exploration expense in 2007 compared to 2006 was due to increases in the colombia and middle eastnorth africa exploration programs and impairments in california

consolidated analysis of financial position 

the changes in the following components of occidental’s balance sheet are discussed below 

selected balance sheet components 

 assets 

see cash flow analysis for discussion about the change in cash and cash equivalents 

the decrease in shortterm investments was due to the sale of occidentals investments in auction rate securities the increase in trade receivables net was due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices and volumes during the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 2006 the decrease in receivables from joint ventures partnerships and other was due to marktomarket adjustments on derivative instruments the increase in inventories was due to an increase in materials and supplies mainly in colombia and libya and higher purchases from third parties in the marketing and trading operations the increase in prepaid expense and other was due to increases in current deferred tax assets and higher prepaid insurance premiums the decrease in assets of discontinued operations was due to the sale of pakistan operations and an exchange involving the horn mountain operations with bp during 2007 

the decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to the sale of 21 million shares of lyondell and the sale of occidental’s interest in a russian joint venture the increase in property plant and equipment ppe net was due to capital expenditures in 2007 and various oil and gas acquisitions offset by 2007 dda and sales of various oil and gas assets 

liabilities and stockholders equity 

the increase in accounts payable was due to higher prices and volumes for purchased crude oil and natural gas in the marketing and trading operations in 2007 the decrease in accrued liabilities was due to contract bonus payments in oman contingent payments related to acquisitions and 2006 accruals for interest that were paid for in the debt tender offers the decrease in domestic and foreign income taxes was due to the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin 48 

the decrease in longterm debt net was due to the january 2007 debt repurchases under cash tender offers the may 2007 redemption of the vintage senior notes due 2012 and required debt payments the increase in deferred credits and other liabilities – other was due to an increase in asset retirement obligations and higher marktomarket adjustments on derivative instruments the decrease in minority interest was due to occidentals purchase of the minority interest in a chemical operation from a third party 

the increase in stockholders equity reflects net income for 2007 partially offset by treasury stock repurchases of approximately 206 million shares in 2007 and dividend payments 

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2007 occidental had approximately 20 billion in cash on hand although income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and production occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs capital expenditure requirements dividend payments anticipated acquisitions debt payments and purchases under its announced common stock repurchase program if needed occidental could access its existing credit facilities 

in september 2006 occidental amended and restated its 15 billion bank credit credit facility to among other things lower the interest rate and extend the term to september 2011 in september 2007 participating lenders extended the maturity date on 14 billion of aggregate loan commitments under the credit facility to september 2012 the credit facility provides for the termination of the loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur or if occidental files for bankruptcy occidental did not draw down any amounts under the credit facility during 2007 available but unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately 15 billion at december 31 2007 

none of occidentals committed bank credits contain material adverse change mac clauses or debt rating triggers that could restrict occidentals ability to borrow under these lines occidentals credit facilities and debt agreements do not contain rating triggers that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings downgrade 

at december 31 2007 under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements occidentals capacity for additional unsecured borrowing was approximately 548 billion and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on and for acquisitions of occidentals capital stock was approximately 208 billion assuming that such dividends distributions and acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowing 

in may 2007 occidental redeemed all 276 million of the outstanding principal amount of its 825percent vintage petroleum llc vintage senior notes due 2012 in january 2007 occidental completed cash tender offers for its 10125percent senior debentures due 2009 925percent senior debentures due 2019 875percent mediumterm notes due 2023 72percent senior debentures due 2028 and 845percent senior notes due 2029 resulting in the repurchase of a portion of these debt instruments totaling 659 million in principal amount the redemption and repurchases resulted in a pretax interest expense of 167 million 

in the first quarter of 2005 occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to 15 billion of various securities as of december 31 2007 no securities had been issued under this shelf 

cash flow analysis 

 the increase in operating cash flow in 2007 compared to 2006 resulted from higher crude oil prices and higher oil and gas production partially offset by the effects of lower chemical margins particularly pvc and reduced cash flow from discontinued operations in 2007 occidental’s realized crude oil prices increased 12 percent and its oil and gas production increased by over 4 percent compared to 2006 the increase in production was mainly due to the startup of the dolphin project production in the third quarter of 2007 

increases in the costs of producing oil and gas such as purchased goods and services and higher utility maintenance and gas plant costs partially offset the effect of increases in realized crude oil prices other cost elements such as labor costs and overhead are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term these cost increases had a much smaller effect on cash flow than the higher crude oil prices and higher crude oil and natural gas production 

most major chemical prices especially pvc decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 which reduced chemical margins the overall impact of the chemical price decreases on cash flow was much less significant than the increase in crude oil prices because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller that those for the oil and gas segment 

the significant increase in operating cash flow in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted from several factors the most important drivers were higher crude oil prices higher oil and gas production and to a much lesser extent higher chemical margins partially offset by the effects of lower gas prices and reduced cash flow from 

discontinued operations in 2006 occidental’s realized crude oil prices increased by 15 percent and its oil and gas production increased by over 17 percent compared to 2005 the increase in production was mainly due to the 11 months of production from the vintage acquisition 

increases in the costs of producing oil and gas such as purchased goods and services and higher utility costs gas plant costs and ad valorem and export taxes partially offset the effect of oil price increases the cost increases had a smaller effect on cash flow than the higher crude oil prices and the higher crude oil and natural gas production 

most major chemical prices increased in 2006 compared to 2005 at a higher rate than ethylene costs thereby improving chemical margins the overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment 

other noncash charges to income in 2007 included deferred compensation stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals other noncash charges to income in 2006 included stock incentive plan amortization deferred compensation and environmental remediation accruals other noncash charges to income in 2005 included chemical asset writedowns deferred compensation stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals 

 the 2007 amount includes cash proceeds of 672 million from the sale of 21 million shares of lyondell 485 million received from the sale of occidental’s interest in a russian joint venture 509 million from the sale of other businesses and properties and 250 million from the sale of auction rate securities the 2007 amount also includes the cash paid for the acquisitions of various oil and gas and chemical interests a permian basin common carrier pipeline system and a gas processing plant in texas totaling 14 billion 

the 2006 amount includes the cash payments associated with the acquisition of vintage and the property acquisition from plains partially offset by cash proceeds from the vintage assets subsequently sold and from the sale of lyondell shares 

the 2005 amount includes the cash payments for several permian basin acquisitions the acquisition of the vulcan chloralkali manufacturing facilities and the payments to reenter libya and to assume operations of the mukhaizna field in oman these were partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of the premcorvalero shares and the lyondell shares 

also see the capital expenditures section below 

 the 2007 amount includes net debt payments of 12 billion including the repurchase of various debt issues under cash tender offers and the redemption of the vintage senior notes due 2012 the 2007 amount also included 11 billion of cash paid for repurchases of 206 million shares of occidental’s common stock at an average price of 5475 per share 

the 2006 amount consists of 15 billion of cash paid for occidental’s stock repurchase plan and net debt payments of approximately 900 million 

the 2005 amount includes net debt payments of approximately 900 million 

occidental paid common stock dividends of 765 million in 2007 646 million in 2006 and 483 million in 2005 

capital expenditures 

  occidental’s capital spending estimate for 2008 is approximately 38 to 39 billion most of the capital spending increase will be allocated to oil and gas exploration production and development activities for the colombia lci project and the vintage properties in argentina and california 

commitments at december 31 2007 for major capital expenditures during 2008 and thereafter were approximately 330 million occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

in the course of its business activities occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives the accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities these transactions or groups of transactions are recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and unless otherwise noted are not reflected on occidental’s balance sheets the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions 

dolphin project 

see oil and gas segment — business review — middle eastnorth africa — dolphin project for further information about the structure of the dolphin project 

in july 2005 dolphin energy entered into a bridge loan in an amount of 245 billion the proceeds of the new bridge loan were used to pay off amounts outstanding on a previous bridge loan and are being used to fund the construction of the dolphin project 

the new bridge loan has a term of four years is a revolving credit facility through april 2008 and may be converted to a term loan thereafter in september 2005 dolphin energy entered into an agreement with banks to provide a 10 billion facility to fund the construction of a certain portion of the dolphin project occidental guarantees 245 percent of both of these obligations of dolphin energy at december 31 2007 occidental’s portion of the bridge loan and financing facility was 816 million occidental had recorded 588 million on the balance sheet at december 31 2007 for the combined bridge loan and financing facility the remaining amounts of the bridge loan and financing facility drawdowns are discussed in the guarantees section below 

ecuador 

in ecuador occidental has a 14percent interest in the oleoducto de crudos pesados ltd ocp oil export pipeline as of december 31 2007 occidental’s net investment in and advances to the project totaled 69 million occidental reports this investment in its consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting the project was funded in part by senior project debt which is to be repaid with the proceeds of shiporpay tariffs of certain upstream producers in ecuador in may 2006 ecuador terminated occidental’s contract for the operation of block 15 which comprised all of its oilproducing operations in the country and seized occidental’s block 15 assets occidental’s guarantee of its share of the shiporpay obligations provides the lenders the right to require occidental to make an advance tariff payment as a result of the expropriation which has not been exercised to date at december 31 2007 the total pretax advance tariff of approximately 89 million was accrued in occidental’s consolidated financial statements this advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt at december 31 2007 occidental also had obligations relating to performance bonds totaling 14 million 

leases 

occidental has entered into various operatinglease agreements mainly for railcars power plants manufacturing facilities and office space occidental leases assets when it offers greater operating flexibility lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales for more information see the contractual obligations table below 

guarantees 

occidental has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds letters of credit indemnities commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by occidental to third parties mainly to provide assurance that opc or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees 

at december 31 2007 the notional amount of the guarantees that are subject to the reporting requirements of fin 45 was approximately 250 million which consists of occidental’s guarantee of equity investees’ debt primarily from the dolphin project equity investment and other commitments 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes and crossreferences certain contractual obligations that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2007 andor disclosed in the accompanying notes 

  lawsuits claims commitments contingencies and related matters 

opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in many lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings these actions seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property damage punitive damages civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief opc or certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar federal state local and foreign environmental laws these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages and civil penalties however occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies with respect to all such lawsuits claims and proceedings including environmental proceedings occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 

since 2004 occidental chemical corporation occ has been served with ten lawsuits filed in nicaragua by approximately 2600 individual plaintiffs these individuals allege that they have sustained several billion dollars of personal injury damages as a result of their alleged exposure to a pesticide occ is aware of but has not been served in 23 additional cases in nicaragua which occidental understands make similar allegations in the opinion of management the claims against occ are without merit because among other things occ believes that none of the pesticide it manufactured was ever sold or used in nicaragua under the applicable nicaraguan statute defendants are required to pay pretrial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from participating fully in their defense occ filed a response to the complaints contesting jurisdiction without posting such pretrial deposit in 2004 the judge in one of the cases osorio case ruled the court had jurisdiction over the defendants including occ and that the plaintiffs had waived the requirement of the pretrial deposit in order to preserve its jurisdictional defense occ elected not to make a substantive appearance in the osorio case in 2005 the judge in the osorio case entered judgment against several defendants including occ for damages totaling approximately 97 million in december 2006 the court in a second case in nicaragua rios case entered a judgment against several defendants including occ for damages totaling approximately 800 million while preserving its jurisdictional defenses occ has appealed the judgments in the osorio and rios cases in september 2007 the plaintiffs in the osorio case filed an action in state court in florida seeking to enforce the nicaraguan judgment that action was removed to and is presently pending in federal court occ has no assets in nicaragua and in the opinion of management any judgment rendered under the statute including in the osorio and rios cases would be unenforceable in the united states 

during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax jurisdictions taxable years prior to 2001 are generally closed for us federal and state corporate income tax purposes corporate tax returns for taxable years 2001 through the current year are in various stages of audit by the us internal revenue service disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law 

occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity drilling services electrical power steam and certain chemical raw materials at december 31 2007 the net present value of the fixed and determinable portion of the obligations under these agreements which were used to collateralize financings of the respective suppliers aggregated 52 million which was payable as follows in millions 2008 – 12 2009 – 10 2010 – 10 2011 – 9 2012 – 8 and thereafter – 3 fixed payments under these agreements were 18 million in 2007 18 million in 2006 and 17 million in 2005 see offbalancesheet arrangements — contractual obligations for further information 

occidental has certain other commitments under contracts guarantees and joint ventures including purchase commitments for goods and services at marketrelated prices and certain other contingent liabilities see offbalancesheet arrangements for further information some of these commitments although not fixed or determinable involve capital expenditures and are part of the 38 to 39 billion in capital expenditures estimated for 2008 

occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2007 occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to future indemnity claims against it in connection with these transactions that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 

it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that opc and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits claims and proceedings audits commitments contingencies and related matters or the timing of these liabilities if these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding occidental’s reserves an outcome not currently anticipated it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon occidental’s consolidated financial position or results of operations however after taking into account reserves management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon occidental’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand 

environmental remediation 

the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases of substances to the environment in many cases the laws apply regardless of fault legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites opc or certain of its subsidiaries participate in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at currentlyowned facilities previouslyowned sites and thirdparty sites also opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including in some instances having been named in proceedings under cercla and similar federal state local and foreign environmental laws these proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages and civil penalties 

as of december 31 2007 occidental through a wholly owed subsidiary participated in or monitored ongoing or recent assessments remediation proceedings or information requests at 163 sites thirtynine of those sites are currently listed or proposed for listing by the us environmental protection agency on the national priorities list 

the following table presents occidental’s environmental remediation reserves at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites 

 the following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years 

 occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next four years and the balance over the next ten or more years occidental believes it is reasonably possible that it will continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these sites the range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to 400 million beyond the amount accrued 

for management’s opinion with respect to environmental matters refer to the lawsuits claims commitments contingencies and related matters section above 

cercla and equivalent sites 

as of december 31 2007 opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in 105 cercla or equivalent proceedings as shown below 

  the six sites with individual reserves over 10 million in 2007 include a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee two closed landfills in western new york and groundwater treatment facilities at three closed chemical plants montague michigan western new york and tacoma washington 

active facilities 

certain subsidiaries of opc are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at 17 active facilities four assets — a chemical plant in louisiana a chemical plant in kansas and certain oil and gas properties and pipeline systems in the southwestern united states — account for 69 percent of the reserves associated with these facilities 

closed or sold facilities 

there are 41 other sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of opc that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in which opc or its subsidiaries are involved four sites account for 70 percent of the reserves associated with this group the four sites are an active refinery in louisiana where occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in pennsylvania a closed chemical plant in pennsylvania and a former phosphorous processing and recovery facility in tennessee 

environmental costs 

occidental’s costs some of which may include estimates relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations are shown below for each segment 

 operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures relate to longerlived improvements in currently operating facilities remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation although total costs may vary in any one year over the long term segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase 

occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately 91 million for 2008 and 93 million for 2009 

foreign investments 

portions of occidental’s assets are located outside of north america at december 31 2007 the carrying value of occidental’s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately 100 billion or approximately 28 percent of occidental’s total assets at that date of such assets approximately 59 billion are located in the middle eastnorth africa and approximately 41 billion are located in latin america for the year ended december 31 2007 net sales outside north america totaled 63 billion or approximately 33 percent of total net sales 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the management of occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of occidental’s management there has been no material change to these policies over the past three years the selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

oil and gas properties 

occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found at the completion of drilling activities the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found if no proved reserves have been found the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense in some cases a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells occidentals practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a twelvemonth period after drilling is complete occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 

annual lease rentals and geological geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred 

proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil natural gas and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs 

several factors could change occidental’s recorded oil and gas reserves occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and an additional share for profit occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices in other contractual arrangements sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to changes in the quantity of recorded proved reserves an additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates differing from those estimated when the reserves were initially recorded occidentals revisions to proved reserves were negative for 2007 and amounted to approximately 3 percent of the total reserves for the year occidental’s revisions to proved reserves were positive for 2006 and amounted to less than 1 percent of the total reserves for the year in 2005 revisions to proved reserves were negative and amounted to less than 1 percent of the total reserves for the year occidentals revisions to proved reserves have been positive for seven of the last ten years additionally occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 144 generally when prices decline other than temporarily reserve estimates change significantly or other significant events occur that may impact the ability to realize the recorded asset amounts 

if occidental’s consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above the most significant impact would be on the dda rate for example a 5percent increase in the amount of consolidated oil and gas reserves would change the rate from 961 per barrel to 913 per barrel which would increase pretax income by 100 million annually a 5percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from 961 per barrel to 1009 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pretax income of 100 million annually 

dda of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unitofproduction method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves the change in the dda rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial 

a portion of the carrying value of occidental’s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties at december 31 2007 the capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties net of accumulated valuation allowance were 14 billion the unproved amounts are not subject to dda or impairment until a determination is made as to the existence of proven reserves as exploration and development work progresses if reserves on these properties are proven capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion if the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made the timing of any 

writedowns of these unproven properties if warranted depends upon the nature timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance 

chemical assets 

the most critical accounting policy affecting occidental’s chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its ppe occidentals chemical plants are depreciated using either the unitofproduction or straightline method based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets which range from 3 years to 50 years are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests the estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained without these continued expenditures the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical plants include sustained higher or lower product prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition feedstock costs energy prices environmental regulations and technological changes 

occidental performs impairment tests on its assets per sfas no 144 whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets 

occidentals net ppe for chemicals is approximately 26 billion and its depreciation expense for 2008 is expected to be approximately 320 million if the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense for example a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pretax earnings by approximately 16 million per year 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience available technology regulations in effect the timing of remediation and costsharing arrangements the environmental reserves are based on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable the reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable as of december 31 2007 and 2006 occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets 

many factors could result in changes to occidental’s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss the most significant are 

 additionally other events might occur that could affect occidental’s future remediation costs such as 

 27 

at sites involving multiple parties occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability when other parties are jointly liable the financial viability of the parties the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating occidentals ultimate share of liability based on these factors occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable in an amount that would have a material effect on occidental’s consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations 

most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories 

category 1 cercla or equivalent sites wherein occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations 

category 2 oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost or 

category 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation 

in all three of these categories occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities as adjusted by recognition for any nonperforming parties 

in addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures which often take in excess of ten years at cercla sites occidental’s reserves include management’s estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems to the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a sitespecific basis 

if the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings for example if the reserve balance were to decrease by 10 percent occidental would record a pretax gain of 46 million if the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 46 million 

other loss contingencies 

occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits claims proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet 

these reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate management’s judgments could change based on new information changes in laws or regulations changes in management’s plans or intentions the outcome of legal proceedings settlements or other factors

derivative activities and market risk 

general 

occidentals market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices occidental has entered into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price fluctuations a derivative is an instrument that among other characteristics derives its value from changes in another instrument or variable 

in general the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices dealer quotes and the black scholes or similar valuation models 

commodity price risk 

general 

occidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices based on current levels of production if oil prices vary overall by 1 per barrel it would have an estimated annual effect on pretax income of approximately 151 million if domestic natural gas prices vary by 050 per mcf it would have an estimated annual effect on pretax income of approximately 96 million if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidental’s results to oil and gas prices also would change 

occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices however changes in cost usually offset part of the effect of price changes on margins if chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by 10ton it would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 15 million and 30 million respectively if pvc prices vary by 01lb it would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 30 million if ethylene dichloride edc prices vary by 10ton it would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 5 million historically product price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock product price changes therefore the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated according to chemical market associates inc december 2007 average contract prices were chlorine—323ton caustic soda—498ton pvc—067lb and edc—310ton 

marketing and trading operations 

occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas derivatives have been used by occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in commodityrelated cash flows occidental enters into lowrisk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization which operates under established policy controls and procedures with respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations occidental utilizes a 

combination of futures forwards options and swaps to offset various physical transactions occidentals use of derivatives in marketing and trading activities relates primarily to managing cash flows from thirdparty purchases which includes occidental’s periodic gas storage activities 

risk management 

occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities which include buying selling marketing trading and hedging activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy the president and chief financial officer and the risk management committee comprising members of occidentals management oversee these controls which are implemented and enforced by the trading control officer the trading control officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities controls for energy commodities include limits on value at risk limits on credit limits on trading segregation of duties delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls 

fair value of marketing and trading derivative contracts 

the following tables reconcile the changes in the net fair value of occidental’s marketing and trading contracts a portion of which are hedges during 2007 and 2006 and segregate the open contracts at december 31 2007 by maturity periods 

    production hedges 

in 2005 occidental entered into a series of fixed price swaps and collar agreements that qualify as cashflow hedges for the sale of a portion of its crude oil production additionally occidental acquired oil and gas fixed price and basis swaps with the vintage acquisition the fixed price swaps and the basis swaps expired in 2007 the collar agreements continue to the end of 2011 the 2007 volume that was hedged was less than 3 percent of occidental’s 2007 crude oil and natural gas production information about these cashflow hedges which are included in the total fair value of 576 million in the table above is presented in a tabular presentation below as of december 31 2007 volumes in thousands of barrels 

  quantitative information 

occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commoditybased derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities this method determines the maximum potential negative shortterm change in fair value with a 95percent level of confidence the marketing and trading value at risk was immaterial during all of 2007 

interest rate risk 

general 

occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its longterm debt obligations in 2005 occidental terminated all of its interestrate swaps that were accounted for as fairvalue hedges these hedges had effectively converted approximately 17 billion of fixedrate debt to variablerate debt the fair value of the swaps at termination resulted in a gain of approximately 20 million which was recorded into income when the debt was paid in 2005 and 2006 the amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement was lower as a result of the swaps and recognition of the gain by approximately 13 million and 21 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

tabular presentation of interest rate risk 

in millions of us dollars except rates 

the table below provides information about occidentals debt obligations which are sensitive to changes in interest rates debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date 

  credit risk 

occidental’s energy contracts are spread among several counterparties creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances current month activity and forward marktomarket exposure losses associated with credit risk have been immaterial for all years presented 

foreign currency risk 

a few of occidental’s foreign operations have currency risk occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes most international crude oil sales are denominated in us dollars additionally all of occidental’s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the us dollar as the functional currency at december 31 2007 and 2006 occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments the effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income and is immaterial

 item 1a risk factors 

volatile global commodity pricing strongly affects occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s financial results typically correlate closely to the volatile prices it obtains for its commodities drilling and exploration activity levels inventory levels production disruptions the actions of opec influencing prices or limiting occidentals production competing fuel prices price speculation changes in consumption patterns weather and geophysical and technical limitations affect the supply of oil and gas and contribute to price volatility 

demand and consequently the price obtained for occidental’s chemical products correlate strongly to the health of the global economy as well as industry expansion cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals both of which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

occidental’s oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affects among other things its profitability and its ability to grow production and replace reserves 

occidental’s future oil and gas production and its results of operations depend in part on its ability to profitably acquire develop or find additional reserves over the past several years occidental increasingly has replaced reserves through acquisitions occidental has many competitors some of which are larger and better funded may be willing to accept greater risks or have special competencies industry competition for reserves may influence occidental to 

 in addition rising exploration and development activity in the industry generally increases the competition for and costs of and delays access to services needed to increase production 

governmental actions and political instability may affect occidental’s results of operations 

occidental’s domestic and foreign oil and gas business is subject to the decisions of many governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of 

 occidental may experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its foreign operations are located in countries occasionally affected by political instability armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems restrictions on production equipment imports and sanctions that prevent continued operations exposure to such risks may increase as a greater percentage of occidental’s future oil and gas production comes from foreign sources 

occidental’s businesses may experience uninsured catastrophic events 

the occurrence of natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods in locations where occidental operates and events such as well blowouts oilfield fires and industrial accidents may affect occidental’s businesses thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses 

occidental’s reserves are based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision 

calculations of reserves depend on estimates concerning reservoir characteristics and recoverability as well as oil and gas prices capital costs and operating costs if occidental were required to make unanticipated significant negative reserve revisions its prospects and stock price may be adversely affected 

occidental may incur significant losses in exploration or cost overruns in development efforts 

occidental may misinterpret geologic or engineering data encounter unexpected geologic conditions or find reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses on exploration or development efforts occidental bears the risks of project delays and cost overruns due to escalating costs for materials and labor equipment failures approval delays construction delays border disputes and other associated risks 

occidental faces risks associated with its mergers acquisitions and divestitures 

occidental’s merger acquisition and divestiture activities carry risks that it may not fully realize anticipated benefits due to delays miscalculation of reserves or production or changed circumstances bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties experience share price declines based on the market’s evaluation of the activity assume or retain liabilities that are greater than anticipated or be unable to resell acquired assets as planned or at planned prices

in this report the term occidental refers to occidental petroleum corporation opc andor one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest subsidiaries occidental’s business is divided into two segments conducted through oil and gas subsidiaries and their affiliates and chemical subsidiaries and their affiliates oxychem 

strategy general 

occidental aims to generate superior total returns to stockholders using the following strategy 

 occidental prefers to own large longlived legacy oil and gas assets like those in california and the permian basin that tend to have moderate decline rates enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to costeffective production management expects such assets to contribute substantially to earnings and cash flow after invested capital 

at occidental maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate abovecostofcapital returns throughout the business cycle during periods of high commodity prices occidental expects to use most of its cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends to improve the potential for future earnings by making such investments 

the chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy capital is expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound way to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects 

designed to lower manufacturing costs asset acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chloralkali and pvc businesses historically the chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure requirements occidental intends to invest this cash mainly in strategically attractive assets 

oil and gas 

segment income  millions 

the oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for finding and development among the lowest in the industry the oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by 

 over the past several years occidental has strengthened its asset base within each of the core areas occidental has invested in and disposed of assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets see oil and gas segment — business review for a discussion of these changes 

in addition occidental has continued to make capital contributions and investments in the dolphin project in qatar and the uae and in libya and assumed operations in the mukhaizna field in oman for future growth opportunities not for current production 

in 2006 occidental acquired vintage petroleum inc vintage which it expects to provide growth in production primarily from the vintage argentina assets 

occidental’s overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its strategy to enhance the development of mature fields beginning with the acquisition of the elk hills oil and gas field in california followed by a series of purchases in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico and the integration of the vintage and plains exploration and production company plains operations acquired in 2006 

at the end of 2006 the elk hills and permian assets made up 64 percent of occidental’s consolidated proven oil reserves and 43 percent of its consolidated proven gas reserves on a barrels of oil equivalent boe basis they accounted for 59 percent of occidental’s consolidated reserves in 2006 the combined production from these assets averaged approximately 290000 boe per day

acquisitions 

in january 2006 occidental completed the merger of vintage into a whollyowned occidental subsidiary as a result occidental acquired assets in argentina california yemen bolivia and the permian basin in texas see the applicable sections below for further information occidental paid 13 billion in cash to former vintage shareholders issued approximately 56 million shares of occidental common stock which were valued at 21 billion and assumed vintage’s debt which had an estimated fair value of 585 million at closing during 2006 occidental divested a portion of vintage’s assets for consideration of approximately 10 billion 

in september 2006 occidental acquired oil and gas assets from plains for 859 million the principal properties acquired are adjacent to occidental’s existing operations in california and the permian basin in west texas 

occidental’s production from the vintage acquisition averaged 53000 boe per day in 2006 during the fourth quarter of 2006 production from the plains assets averaged 6000 boe per day 

elk hills 

occidental operates the elk hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of california’s san joaquin valley with an approximate 78percent interest the field was acquired in 1998 for 35 billion and is the largest producer of gas in california in 2006 occidental made additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing properties near the field for approximately 434 million most of these properties were obtained as part of the acquisition from plains discussed above oil and gas production in 2006 from these properties and the field was approximately 91000 boe per day during 2006 occidental performed infill drilling field extensions and recompletions identified by advanced reservoir characterization techniques resulting in 277 new wells being drilled and 479 wells being worked over in addition an air separation unit was installed to enhance 

oil recovery with nitrogen injection as a result of these activities and acquisitions occidental was able to maintain production at 2005 levels since its acquisition total elk hills oil and gas production has been approximately 301 million boe at the end of 2006 the property had an estimated 484 million boe of proved reserves compared to the 425 million boe that were recorded at the time of the acquisition 

permian basin 

the permian basin extends throughout southwest texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states with the entire basin accounting for approximately 18 percent of the total united states oil production occidental is the largest producer in the permian basin with an approximate 16percent net share of the total permian basin oil production occidental also produces and processes natural gas and natural gas liquids ngl in the permian basin 

most of occidentals permian basin interests were obtained through the acquisition of altura in 2000 for approximately 36 billion in 2005 and 2006 occidental made several additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing property interests for approximately 17 billion and 290 million including approximately 175 million related to the acquisition of vintage and the property acquisitions from plains respectively 

occidentals total share of permian basin oil gas and ngl production averaged 199000 boe per day in 2006 compared to 189000 boe per day in 2005 at the end of 2006 occidentals permian basin properties had 12 billion boe in proved reserves occidentals permian basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas the largest producing areas in 2006 included wasson san andres slaughter levelland north cowden wasson clearfork and salt creek which contributed 20 percent 9 percent 5 percent 4 percent 4 percent and 4 percent respectively to occidental’s 2006 permian boe production 

occidental’s interests in the permian basin offer additional development and exploitation potential during 2006 occidental drilled approximately 260 wells on its operated properties and participated in wells drilled on outside operated interests occidental conducted significant development activity on eight carbon dioxide co 2  projects during 2006 including implementation of new floods and expansion of existing co 2 floods occidental also focused on improving the performance of existing wells occidental had an average of 122 well service units working in the permian area during 2006 performing well maintenance and workovers 

approximately 60 percent of occidental’s permian basin oil production is from fields that actively employ the application of co 2 flood technology an enhanced oil recovery eor technique this involves injecting co 2 into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent causing the oil to flow more freely into producing wells these co 2 flood operations make occidental a world leader in the application of this technology 

vintage california 

in 2006 occidental combined its california properties acquired from vintage and plains with existing california properties excluding the elk hills thums and tidelands oil production company tidelands properties the combined properties produce oil and gas from more than 50 fields spread over 500 miles mainly in the ventura san joaquin and sacramento basins oil and gas average production in 2006 was approximately 17000 boe per day at the end of 2006 the combined properties had an estimated 128 million boe of proved reserves 

thums

occidental acquired tidelands in 2006 tidelands is the field contractor for an onshore oil production unit in long beach california occidental’s share of production from tidelands is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc whereby occidental’s share of production varies inversely with oil prices tidelands also is subject to costplus contracts 

occidental’s hugoton and other operations produced 26000 boe per day 

middle eastnorth africa dolphin project 

occidentals investment in the dolphin project which was acquired in 2002 consists of two separate economic interests held through two separate legal entities one entity oxy dolphin ep llc owns a 245percent undivided interest in the assets and liabilities associated with a development and production sharing agreement dpsa with the government of qatar to develop and produce natural gas and condensate in qatar’s north field for 25 years from the start of production with a provision to request a 5year extension the purchase price of the undivided working interest in the dpsa was approximately 60 million and was recorded in property plant  equipment ppe this undivided interest is proportionately consolidated in occidentals financial statements 

a second entity oxy dolphin pipeline llc owns 245 percent of the stock of dolphin energy limited dolphin energy the purchase price of dolphin energy stock totaled approximately 250 million and was recorded as an equity investment 

dolphin energy is the operator under the dpsa on behalf of the three dpsa participants including occidental dolphin energy also has the rights to build own and operate a 260milelong 48inch natural gas pipeline which will transport dry natural gas from qatar to the uae 

the dolphin project is expected to cost approximately 48 billion in total including investments in the local uae eastern gas distribution system and the al ainfujairah pipelines which were added to improve the natural gas distribution system but were not contained in the original scope of the dolphin project occidental expects to invest approximately 12 billion of this total the project is being financed by a combination of participant investment and project financing during 2007 occidental expects to spend a combined total of approximately 185 million for the gas exploration and development activity and the investment in dolphin energy compared to 361 million in 2006

occidental is the operator of the caño limón field where its share of production averaged 28000 barrels of oil per day in 2006 colombias national oil company ecopetrol operates the caño limóncoveñas oil pipeline and marineexport terminal the pipeline transports oil produced from the caño limón field for export to international markets 

in 2005 ecopetrol approved development of the caricare field an exploration discovery under the rondon association contract adjacent to caño limón production from this field where occidental holds a 35percent working interest commenced in may 2006 production from the field and two adjacent fields was 4000 boe per day in 2006 

in 2005 occidental signed a new agreement with ecopetrol for an eor project in the la cirainfantas field located in central colombia in december 2006 occidental completed the second pilot phase and agreed with ecopetrol to enter into a third and commercial phase of the project in 2006 occidental’s share of production was 1000 boe per day production from la cirainfantas is transported by the ecopetrol pipeline and sold to an ecopetrol refinery 

additionally occidental holds various working interests in eight exploration blocks 

ecuador 

in may 2006 ecuador terminated occidentals contract for the operation of block 15 which comprised all of its oilproducing operations in the country and seized occidentals block 15 assets the process resulting in this action began shortly after occidental prevailed by unanimous decision of an international arbitration panel subsequently upheld by a london court in a legal dispute over tax refunds that ecuador wrongfully withheld occidental immediately filed an arbitration claim against ecuador seeking redress for illegal confiscation of the block 15 operations with the international centre for settlement of investment disputes in washington dc invoking the protections of the us  ecuador bilateral investment treaty as a result of the seizure occidental classified its block 15 operations as discontinued operations in 2006 occidental recorded a net aftertax charge of 296 million in discontinued operations this amount consists of aftertax charges for the writeoff of the investment in block 15 in ecuador as well as shiporpay obligations entered into with respect to the oleoducto de crudos pesados ltd ocp pipeline in ecuador to ship oil produced in block 15 partially offset by 109 million aftertax income from operations for the first five months of 2006 occidental’s block 15 assets and liabilities are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets on a retrospective basis 

in addition occidental has a 14percent interest in the ocp oil export pipeline see also offbalancesheet arrangements — ecuador for further information about the ocp pipeline 

productionsharing contracts 

occidental conducts its operations in qatar oman and yemen under pscs and under such contracts receives a share of production to recover its costs and an additional share for profit in addition occidentals share of production from thums and tidelands are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc occidental’s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 

proved reserves  evaluation and review process 

a senior corporate officer of occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data in addition a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee has been established consisting of senior corporate officers to monitor and review occidentals oil and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidentals board of directors periodically throughout the year occidental has retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum engineering consultants to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes since 2004 

again in 2006 ryder scott has compared occidental’s methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry standards and has reviewed certain data methods and procedures used in estimating reserves volumes the economic evaluations and reserves classifications ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of occidental’s total reserves portfolio in 2006 ryder scott reviewed 105 percent of occidental’s oil and gas reserves since being engaged in 2004 ryder scott has reviewed occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 49 percent of occidental’s oil and gas reserves 

based on this review including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott has concluded that the methodologies used by occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current securities and exchange commission sec standards ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes reported by occidental 

proved reserve additions 

occidental consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at yearend 2006 of 2869 million boe as compared with the yearend 2005 amount of 2566 million boe additionally occidental’s investments in other interests had proved reserves of 30 million and 45 million boe at yearend 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in the consolidated subsidiaries’ reserves from all sources was 518 million boe of which 289 million boe were from proved developed reserves and 229 million boe were from proved undeveloped reserves 

proved developed reserves represent approximately 78 percent of occidental’s total proved reserves at yearend 2006 compared to 74 percent at yearend 2005 

proved reserve additions  consolidated subsidiaries  2006 

 proved reserves consist of 78 percent crude oil and condensate and 22 percent natural gas 

revisions of previous estimates 

in 2006 occidental added net reserves of 17 million boe through revisions of previous estimates primarily in libya the dolphin project and argentina partially offset by negative revisions in the united states reflecting a reduction in gas prices oil price changes would affect proved reserves recorded by occidental for example if oil prices increased by 5 per barrel less oil volume is required to recover costs and pscs would reduce occidentals share of proved reserves by approximately 9 million boe conversely if oil prices dropped by 5 per barrel occidentals share of proved reserves would increase by a similar amount oil price changes would also tend to affect the economic lives of proved reserves from other contracts in a manner partially offsetting the psc reserve volume changes apart from the effects of product prices occidentals approach to interpreting technical data regarding oil and gas reserves makes it more likely future reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative 

improved recovery 

in 2006 occidental added reserves of 141 million boe through improved recovery in the united states improved recovery additions were 43 million boe in the permian basin and 28 million boe in the elk hills field foreign additions included 23 million boe in argentina and 11 million boe in colombia the elk hills operations employ infill drilling and both gas flood and water flood techniques in the permian basin the increased reserves were primarily attributable to enhanced recovery techniques such as drilling additional co 2 flood and water flood wells 

extensions and discoveries 

occidental obtains reserve additions from extensions and discoveries which are dependent on successful exploitation programs in 2006 as a result of such programs occidental added reserves of 34 million boe consisting of 13 million boe in the united states 14 million boe in the middle eastnorth africa and 7 million boe in argentina in western colorado occidental added approximately 4 million boe from the extension of gas reserves most of which will require additional development capital 

the success of improved recovery extension and discovery projects depends on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements as well as oil and gas prices capital costs and operating costs many of these factors are outside of managements control and will affect whether or not these historical sources of reserve additions continue at similar levels 

purchases of proved reserves 

in 2006 occidental purchased reserves of 326 million boe of which 143 million boe were in the united states and 178 million boe were in latin america the vintage acquisition added proved reserves of 160 million boe in argentina and 8 million boe in bolivia with the remainder in the united states and yemen of which 66 percent were proved developed reserves occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at reasonable prices acquisitions are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil and gas contracts at attractive terms as market conditions change the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly 

proved undeveloped reserves 

occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 207 million boe resulting from improved recovery extensions and discoveries and purchases primarily in argentina the permian basin and the elk hills field argentina provided 46 percent of this increase these proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by reserve transfers of 275 million boe to the proved developed category as a result of 2006 development programs the dolphin project transferred 133 million boe to the proved developed category during 2006 this transfer along with other revisions reduced the dolphin projects proved undeveloped reserves to 132 million boe at december 31 2006 from 250 million boe at december 31 2005 overall occidentals proved undeveloped reserves decreased by 47 million boe in 2006 

industry outlook 

the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather inventory levels competing fuel prices overall demand and the availability of supply 

worldwide oil prices in 2006 remained at or near historical highs during the first three quarters of the year but fell in the fourth quarter continued economic growth resulting in increased demand and concerns about supply availability could result in continued high prices a lower demand growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices 

oil prices have significantly affected profitability and returns for occidental and other upstream producers oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty the wti price has averaged approximately 33 per barrel over the past ten years however the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations in prices during 2006 occidental experienced an increase in its price differential of the average wti price over occidentals realized prices see the oil and gas segment — business environment section above for further information 

while local supplydemand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term daytoday prices may be more volatile in the futures markets such as on the nymex and other exchanges making it difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence over the last ten years the nymex gas price has averaged approximately 460 per mcf 

chemical segment business environment 

the chemical segment results improved in 2006 due to better margins despite higher feedstock costs oxychem also benefited from the midyear 2005 acquisition of two basic chemical manufacturing facilities from vulcan materials company vulcan and realized substantial synergies and higher sales volumes 

business review basic chemicals 

during 2006 demand and pricing for basic chemical products generally remained strong while energy costs fell which enabled oxychem to realize above average margins oxychem’s chloralkali operating rate for 2006 was 91 percent just slightly above the industry average operating rate of 90 percent industry demand for liquid caustic soda in 2006 was virtually flat compared to the prior year demand increased in the refining industry but was offset by reduced demand primarily in the organics and inorganics chemical market segments industry pricing for caustic soda started the year strong but subsequently softened throughout the first three quarters of 2006 caustic soda supply tightened in the fourth quarter due to lower chlorine demand resulting from a weakening vinyls sector and lower imports of caustic soda this led to caustic soda price stabilization in the fourth quarter 

vinyls 

the pvc industry realized record level pricing and margins for 2006 ethylene cost increases of 9 percent were partially offset by lower natural gas prices total pvc industrywide demand in 2006 was 3 percent lower as compared with 2005 oxychem operated its pvc facilities at an average operating rate of 82 percent for 2006 compared to the north american industry average of 87 percent 

industry outlook 

in 2006 occidentals chemical business core earnings increased by 16 percent compared to 2005 primarily due to the continued strong united states economy higher sales volumes largely due to the full year impact of the vulcan operating assets and improving margins 

future performance will depend on global economic activity the competitiveness of the united states in the world economy feedstock and energy pricing and the impact of additional production capacity entering the market place 

basic chemicals 

forecasts of a slowing economy offset by a stabilizing residential construction market in 2007 are expected to result in demand levels similar to average 2006 levels despite first quarter pressure on pricing from a weak vinyls market margins in 2007 are expected to remain strong but could weaken in the fourth quarter due to the anticipated impact of capacity additions in late 2007 

vinyls 

industrywide pvc operating rates are expected to be lower in 2007 as a result of weak demand in the first quarter coupled with the startup of new capacity later in the year 

lower cost far east asian pvc production has resulted in a significant increase in imports of pvc and finished goods into the western hemisphere 

corporate and other 

corporate and other includes the investments in lyondell chemical company lyondell and premcor inc premcor a leased cogeneration facility in taft louisiana and a 1300mile oil pipeline and gathering system located in the permian basin which is used in corporatedirected oil and gas marketing and trading operations it also includes a cogeneration facility at ingleside texas in which occidental held a 50percent interest and acquired the remaining 50percent interest in october 2006 the premcor investment was sold in 2005 

since december 31 2006 occidental has resolved certain legal disputes that it expects will result in a gain of approximately 108 million in the first quarter of 2007 

on august 1 2006 occidental effected a twoforone stock split in the form of a stock dividend to shareholders of record as of that date with distribution of the shares on august 15 2006 all share and per share amounts discussed and disclosed in this annual report on form 10k reflect the effect of the stock split 

lyondell 

in may 2006 occidental lost significant influence over lyondell and classified its lyondell shares as an availableforsale investment in october 2006 occidental sold 10 million shares of lyondells common stock in a registered public offering for a pretax gain of 90 million and gross proceeds of 250 million at december 31 2006 occidental owned 203 million lyondell shares of common stock 8percent ownership with a carrying value of 519 million and warrants to purchase an additional five million shares of lyondell common stock in february 2007 occidental exercised these warrants and received approximately 700000 shares of lyondell stock following this transaction occidental owned approximately 21 million shares of lyondell common stock 

premcor 

valero energy corp’s valero acquisition of premcor resulted in a 704 million pretax gain and the subsequent sale of all of the valero shares received resulted in an additional 22 million pretax gain in 2005 

segment results of operations 

the following discussion of occidental’s two operating segments and corporate items should be read in conjunction with note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

segment earnings generally exclude income taxes interest income interest expense environmental remediation expenses unallocated corporate expenses discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and results and other earnings from the segments equity investments 

the following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items 

  oil and gas 

 18 

oil and gas continued 

  core earnings in 2006 were 72 billion compared to 60 billion in 2005 the increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher crude oil prices and oil and gas production partially offset by higher operating expenses including a depreciation depletion and amortization dda increase which was driven by higher volumes and rates 

core earnings in 2005 were 60 billion compared with 40 billion in 2004 the increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher prices and volumes for crude oil and natural gas partially offset by higher operating expenses higher exploration expense and increased dda rates 

average consolidated production costs for 2006 were 1123 per boe compared to the average 2005 production cost of 881 per boe at least 41 percent of the increase was a result of higher energy prices pushing up utility costs gas plant costs and ad valorem and export taxes and the impact on occidentals pscs of lower volumes due to higher energy prices these cash operating cost increases included 057 per barrel for taxes and 033 per barrel for higher energy costs the remaining increase of 152 per barrel was the result of higher workover maintenance and lifting costs maintenance costs increased by 116 million while workovers ad valorem taxes and utilities each accounted for approximately 55 million in higher costs during 2006 

also see productionsharing contracts above 

chemical 

  core earnings in 2006 were 901 million compared to 777 million in 2005 the increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher margins in chlorine caustic soda and pvc 

core earnings in 2005 were 777 million compared with 414 million in 2004 the increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher margins resulting from higher prices for chlorine caustic soda and pvc partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs 

significant items affecting earnings 

occidental’s results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature timing and amount therefore management uses a measure called core earnings which excludes those items this nongenerally accepted accounting principles gaap measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management’s performance but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing occidental’s earnings performance between periods reported earnings are considered representative of management’s performance over the long term core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with gaap 

significant items affecting earnings 

  taxes 

deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets of 14 billion were 21 billion at december 31 2006 the current portion of the deferred tax assets of 190 million is included in prepaid expenses and other the net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences 

worldwide effective tax rate 

the following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for reported income from continuing operations and core earnings 

  occidentals 2006 worldwide effective tax rate was 44 percent for both reported and core income the lower income tax rate for reported income in 2005 compared to 2006 resulted from a 335 million 2005 tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required and a 619 million 2005 tax benefit resulting from a closing agreement with the irs resolving certain foreign tax credit issues 

consolidated results of operations 

selected revenue items 

 the increase in net sales in 2006 compared to 2005 reflects higher crude oil prices and oil and gas production and higher chemical prices partially offset by lower natural gas prices 

the increase in net sales in 2005 compared to 2004 reflects higher crude oil natural gas and chemical prices 

the increase in interest dividends and other income in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily due to a 108 million gain related to litigation settlements and interest income earned on a higher level of cash and cash equivalents 

the increase in interest dividends and other income in 2005 compared to 2004 reflects higher interest income earned on a higher level of cash and cash equivalents 

gains on disposition of assets net in 2006 includes a gain of 90 million from the sale of 10 million shares of lyondell stock 

gain on disposition of assets net in 2005 includes a gain of 726 million resulting from valero’s acquisition of premcor and the subsequent sale of all of the valero shares received and a gain of 140 million on the sale of 11 million shares of lyondell stock 

selected expense items 

  cost of sales increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher oil and gas production maintenance workover and utility costs and higher ad valorem and export taxes 

cost of sales increased in 2005 compared to 2004 mainly due to higher oil and gas production costs and higher energy and feedstock costs 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher oil and gas production taxes and increases in sharebased and incentive compensation expense 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to the chemical plant writeoffs and writedowns in 2005 higher costs in oil and gas including higher productionrelated taxes and increases in sharebased compensation expense 

dda increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to increased production mainly from the vintage acquisition and higher costs of new reserve additions resulting in a higher dda rate 

dda increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to higher costs of new reserve additions resulting in a higher dda rate 

the increase in exploration expense in 2005 compared to 2004 was due mostly to higher dry hole writeoffs and impairment costs and higher seismic and geological and geophysical costs 

interest and debt expense in 2006 2005 and 2004 included pretax debt repayment expenses of 35 million 42 million and 17 million respectively excluding the effects of these debt repayment charges interest expense increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to higher interest rates which were partially offset by lower debt levels 

selected other items 

 the increase in the provision for income taxes in 2006 compared to 2005 was due to an increase in income before taxes in 2006 a 335 million 2005 tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required and a 619 million 2005 tax benefit related to the resolution of certain irs tax issues 

the decrease in income from equity investments in 2006 compared to 2005 is mainly due to the change in occidental’s accounting for its lyondell shares from equity method to availableforsale investment in may 2006 

the increase in income from equity investments in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to improved results from the lyondell equity investment and higher income from a russian oil and gas equity investee 

the gain on lyondell stock issuance in 2004 represents occidentals share of the increase in lyondells net equity resulting from lyondells issuance of stock to purchase millennium 

consolidated analysis of financial position 

the changes in the following components of occidental’s balance sheet are discussed below 

selected balance sheet components 

 21 

assets 

see “cash flow analysis” for discussion about the change in cash and cash equivalents the increase in trade receivables is due to higher worldwide oil prices and higher oil and gas production volumes during the fourth quarter of 2006 versus 2005 the increase in inventories is due to an increase in materials and supplies mainly in oman and colombia and increases in chemical inventory volumes during the fourth quarter of 2006 versus 2005 the decrease in assets of discontinued operations is due to the writeoff of the investment in block 15 in ecuador during the second quarter of 2006 

the decrease in longterm receivables reflects lower marktomarket adjustments on longterm derivative financial instruments the increase in investments in unconsolidated entities is due to marktomarket adjustments on the lyondell investment which became an availableforsale investment in may 2006 and additional capital investments made on the dolphin project during 2006 partially offset by the sale of 10 million shares of lyondell common stock the increase in ppe is due to the acquisitions of vintage and properties from plains completed in the first and third quarters of 2006 respectively and oil and gas capital expenditures during 2006 

liabilities and stockholders equity 

debt to capitalization a 

 the increase in current maturities of longterm debt and capital leases is due to the 40percent mediumterm notes which were reclassified from longterm to current since they mature in 2007 the increase in accounts payable is due to the vintage acquisition higher prices and volumes for purchased oil in the marketing and trading operations and higher chemical volume and feedstock price increases during 2006 

the decrease in longterm debt net is due to various debt redemptions and repurchases throughout 2006 offset by the debt assumed in the vintage acquisition the increase in deferred credits and other liabilities – income taxes is due to the additional deferred taxes recorded as part of the vintage acquisition purchase accounting the increase in deferred credits and other liabilities – other is due to additional pension liabilities recorded in connection with occidental’s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas 158 the increase in longterm liabilities of discontinued operations was due to accruing the ocp shiporpay obligations in ecuador 

the increase in stockholders equity reflects the stock issued as consideration for the vintage acquisition and net income for 2006 partially offset by treasury stock repurchases and dividend payments 

liquidity and capital resources 

at december 31 2006 occidental had approximately 16 billion in cash and shortterm investments on hand although income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and production occidental believes that cash and shortterm investments on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs capital expenditure requirements dividend payments potential acquisitions its announced common stock repurchase program and debt repurchases if needed occidental could access its existing credit facilities 

available but unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately 15 billion at december 31 2006 in september 2006 occidental amended and restated its 15 billion bank credit credit facility to among other things lower the interest rate and extend the term to september 2011 the credit facility provides for the termination of the loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur or if occidental files for bankruptcy occidental had not drawn down any amounts on the credit facility at december 31 2006 none of occidentals committed bank credits contain material adverse change mac clauses or debt rating triggers that could restrict occidentals ability to borrow under these lines occidentals credit facilities and debt agreements do not contain rating triggers that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings downgrade 

at december 31 2006 under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements occidentals capacity for additional unsecured borrowing was approximately 448 billion and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on and for acquisitions of occidentals capital stock was approximately 172 billion assuming that such dividends distributions and acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowing 

in january 2006 occidental completed the vintage acquisition and paid 13 billion in cash to former vintage shareholders and issued approximately 56 million shares of occidental common stock which were valued at 21 billion in addition occidental assumed vintage’s debt which had an estimated fair market value of 585 million at closing 

in 2006 occidental redeemed or repurchased 274 million of this newly acquired debt including all of its 7875percent vintage senior subordinated notes due 2011 and 74 million of its 825percent vintage senior notes due 2012 additionally occidental redeemed all of its 7375percent senior notes due 2008 and purchased and retired a total of 120 million of its 4percent mediumterm notes due 2007 its 425percent mediumterm notes due 2010 its 675percent senior notes due 2012 its 925percent senior debentures due 2019 its 875percent senior notes due 2023 and its 845percent senior notes due 2029 

in 2005 occidental redeemed all of its 5875percent senior notes due 2007 all of its 4101percent mediumterm senior notes due 2007 all of its 765percent senior notes due 2006 and three of its unsecured subsidiary notes due 2028 through 2030 in addition occidental purchased and retired a total of 213 million of its 675percent senior notes due 2012 its 10125percent senior notes due 2009 its 4percent mediumterm senior notes due 2007 and its 425percent mediumterm senior notes due 2010 

in july 2005 dolphin energy entered into a bridge loan in an amount of 245 billion the proceeds of the new bridge loan were used to pay off amounts outstanding on a previous bridge loan and are being used to fund the construction of the dolphin project the new bridge loan has a term of four years is a revolving credit facility for the first two years and may be converted to a term loan thereafter in september 2005 dolphin energy entered into an agreement with banks to provide a 10 billion islamiclawcompliant facility to fund the construction of a certain portion of the dolphin project this fouryear financing facility is structured as a transaction in which dolphin energy constructs part of the midstream portion of the dolphin project on behalf of a group of islamic investors and enters into a lease to use such assets upon construction completion occidental guarantees 245 percent of both of these obligations of dolphin energy at december 31 2006 occidental’s portion of the bridge loan and islamiclawcompliant facility draw downs were 469 million and 184 million respectively occidental had recorded 473 million on the balance sheet at december 31 2006 for the combined bridge loan and islamiclawcompliant facility the remaining amounts of the bridge loan and islamiclawcompliant facility draw downs are included in guarantees discussed in “offbalancesheet arrangements – guarantees” below 

in the first quarter of 2005 occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to 15 billion of various securities as of december 31 2006 no securities had been issued under this shelf 

in january 2007 occidental completed a cash tender offer for its 10125percent senior debentures due 2009 925percent senior debentures due 2019 875percent senior notes due 2023 72percent senior debentures due 2028 and 845percent senior notes due 2029 resulting in the repurchase of a portion of these debt instruments totaling 659 million the repurchases were funded with occidental’s cash on hand and resulted in debt repurchase expenses of 165 million 

cash flow analysis 

 the significant increase in operating cash flow in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted from several factors the most important drivers were higher crude oil prices higher oil and gas production and to a much lesser extent higher chemical margins partially offset by the effects of lower gas prices and reduced cash flow from discontinued operations in 2006 occidental’s realized crude oil prices increased by 15 percent and its oil and gas production increased by over 14 percent compared to 2005 the increase in production was mainly due to the 11 months of production from the vintage acquisition 

increases in the costs of producing oil and gas such as purchased goods and services and higher utility costs gas plant costs and ad valorem and export taxes partially offset the effect of oil price increases other cost elements such as labor costs and overheads are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term the cost increases had a smaller effect on cash flow than the higher crude oil prices and the higher crude oil and natural gas production 

most major chemical prices increased in 2006 compared to 2005 at a higher rate than ethylene costs thereby improving chemical margins the overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment sales volumes for certain chemical products were slightly lower in 2006 however this did not have a significant effect on occidental’s earnings and cash flow 

the significant increase in operating cash flow in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted from several factors the most important drivers were the significantly higher oil and natural gas prices and to a much lesser extent chemical prices although the changes in realized prices varied among the regions in which occidental operates in 2005 occidentals realized oil prices were higher overall by 37 percent occidental’s realized natural gas price increased over 33 percent in the united states where approximately 80 percent of occidental’s natural gas was produced in 2005 

increases in the costs of producing oil and gas such as purchased goods and services and higher utility gas plant and production taxes partially offset oil and gas sales price increases but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized price increases other cost elements such as labor costs and overheads are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term 

most major chemical prices increased in 2005 at a higher rate than the energydriven increase in feedstock and power costs thereby improving profits and cash flow the overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes not only because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment but also because of increases in energy pricedriven feedstock and electric power costs which are major elements of manufacturing cost for the chemical segments products sales volumes for chemical products generally were higher in 2005 but this did not have a significant effect on occidentals earnings and cash flow 

other noncash charges to income in 2006 included stock incentive plan amortization deferred compensation and environmental remediation accruals other noncash charges to income in 2005 included chemical asset writedowns deferred compensation stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals other noncash charges in 2004 included deferred compensation stock incentive plan amortization environmental remediation accruals and a chemical asset writedown 

 the 2006 amount includes the cash payments associated with the acquisition of vintage and the property acquisition from plains partially offset by cash proceeds from the vintage assets subsequently sold and from the sale of lyondell shares 

the 2005 amount includes the cash payments for several permian basin acquisitions the acquisition of the vulcan chloralkali manufacturing facilities and the payments to reenter libya and to assume operations of the mukhaizna field in oman these were partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of the premcorvalero shares and the lyondell shares 

the 2004 amount includes the purchase of a pipeline and gathering system in the permian basin and a 204 million advance to the elk hills power llc ehp equity investment which ehp used to repay a portion of its debt 

also see the capital expenditures section below 

 the 2006 amount consists of 15 billion of cash paid for occidental’s stock repurchase plan and net debt payments of approximately 900 million 

the 2005 amount includes net debt payments of approximately 900 million 

the 2004 amount includes 466 million paid to redeem the trust preferred securities in january 2004 and 159 million paid to redeem occidentals 65percent senior notes 

occidental paid common stock dividends of 646 million in 2006 483 million in 2005 and 424 million in 2004 

capital expenditures 

  occidental’s capital spending estimate for 2007 is approximately 33 to 34 billion most of the capital spending will be allocated to oil and gas exploration production and development activities for the oman mukhaizna project the vintage properties in argentina and california libya qatar the permian basin and elk hills 

commitments at december 31 2006 for major capital expenditures during 2007 and thereafter were approximately 787 million occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

in the course of its business activities occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives the accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities these transactions or groups of transactions are recorded in compliance with gaap and unless otherwise noted are not reflected on occidental’s balance sheets the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions 

dolphin project

ecuador 

in ecuador occidental has a 14percent interest in the ocp oil export pipeline as of december 31 2006 occidental’s net investment in and advances to the project totaled 72 million occidental reports this investment in its consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting the project was funded in part by senior project debt the senior project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of shiporpay tariffs of certain upstream producers in ecuador in may 2006 ecuador terminated occidental’s contract for the operation of block 15 which comprised all of its oilproducing operations in the country and seized occidental’s block 15 assets occidental’s guarantee of its share of the shiporpay obligations provides the lenders the right to require occidental to make an advance tariff payment as a result of the expropriation at december 31 2006 the total pretax advance tariff payment of approximately 95 million was accrued in occidental’s consolidated financial statements and was included in the net aftertax charge of 296 million discussed in the “business review – latin america – ecuador” section this advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt at december 31 2006 occidental also had obligations relating to performance bonds totaling 14 million 

leases 

occidental has entered into various operatinglease agreements mainly for railcars power plants manufacturing facilities and office space occidental leases assets when it offers greater operating flexibility lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales see the contractual obligations table below 

guarantees 

occidental has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds letters of credit indemnities commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by occidental to third parties mainly to provide assurance that opc or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees 

at december 31 2006 the notional amount of the guarantees that are subject to the reporting requirements of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no fin 45 was approximately 270 million which consists of occidental’s guarantee of equity investees’ debt primarily from the dolphin project equity investment and other commitments 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes and crossreferences certain contractual obligations that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2006 andor disclosed in the accompanying notes 

  lawsuits claims commitments contingencies and related matters 

opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in many lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings these actions seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property damage punitive damages civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief opc or certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar federal state local and foreign environmental laws these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages and civil penalties however occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies with respect to all such lawsuits claims and proceedings including environmental proceedings occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 

since 2004 occidental chemical corporation occ has been served with ten lawsuits filed in nicaragua by approximately 2600 individual plaintiffs these individuals allege that they have sustained several billion dollars of personal injury damages as a result of their alleged exposure to a pesticide occ is aware of but has not been served in 24 additional cases in nicaragua which occidental understands make similar allegations in the opinion of management the claims against occ are without merit because among other things occ believes that none of the pesticide it manufactured was ever sold or used in nicaragua under the applicable nicaraguan statute defendants are required to pay pretrial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from participating fully in their defense occ filed a response to the complaints contesting jurisdiction without posting such pretrial deposit in 2004 the judge in one of the cases osorio case ruled the court had jurisdiction over the defendants including occ and that the plaintiffs had waived the requirement of the pretrial deposit in order to preserve its jurisdictional defense occ elected not to make a substantive appearance in the osorio case in 2005 the judge in the osorio case entered judgment against several defendants including occ for damages totaling approximately 97 million in december 2006 the court in a second case in nicaragua rios case entered a judgment against several defendants including occ for damages totaling approximately 800 million while preserving its jurisdictional defenses occ has appealed the judgments in the osorio and rios cases occ has no assets in nicaragua and in the opinion of management any judgment rendered under the statute including in the osorio and rios cases would be unenforceable in the united states 

during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax jurisdictions taxable years prior to 2001 are generally closed for us federal corporate income tax purposes corporate tax returns for taxable years 2001 through 2003 are in various stages of audit by the us internal revenue service disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law 

occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity drilling services electrical power steam and certain chemical raw materials at december 31 2006 the net present value of the fixed and determinable portion of the obligations under these agreements which were used to collateralize financings of the respective suppliers aggregated 16 million which was payable as follows in millions 2007 – 12 and 2008 – 4 fixed payments under these agreements were 18 million in 2006 17 million in 2005 and 19 million in 2004 see offbalancesheet arrangements — contractual obligations for further information 

occidental has certain other commitments under contracts guarantees and joint ventures including purchase commitments for goods and services at marketrelated prices and certain other contingent liabilities see offbalancesheet arrangements for further information some of these commitments 

although not fixed or determinable involve capital expenditures and are part of the 33 to 34 billion in capital expenditures estimated for 2007 

occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2006 occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to future indemnity claims against it in connection with these transactions that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 

it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that opc and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits claims and proceedings audits commitments contingencies and related matters or the timing of these liabilities if these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding occidental’s reserves an outcome not currently anticipated it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon occidental’s consolidated financial position or results of operations however after taking into account reserves management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon occidental’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand 

environmental remediation 

the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases of substances to the environment in many cases the laws apply regardless of fault legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites opc or certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal superfund sites comparable state sites and other domestic and foreign remediation sites including currently owned facilities and previously owned sites also opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including in some instances having been named in proceedings under cercla and similar federal state and local environmental laws these proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages and civil penalties 

occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary glenn springs holdings inc which reports its results directly to occidental’s corporate management 

the following table presents occidental’s environmental remediation reserves at december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites 

 the following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years 

 occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next ten or more years occidental believes it is reasonably possible that it will continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these sites the range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to 430 million beyond the amount accrued 

for management’s opinion refer to the lawsuits claims commitments contingencies and related matters section above 

cercla and equivalent sites 

as of december 31 2006 opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in 105 cercla or state equivalent proceedings as shown below 

  the six sites with individual reserves over 10 million in 2006 include a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee two closed landfills in western new york and groundwater treatment facilities at three closed chemical plants montague michigan western new york and tacoma washington 

active facilities 

certain subsidiaries of opc are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at 21 active facilities five facilities — a chemical plant in louisiana a phosphorus recovery operation in tennessee a chemical plant in texas a chemical plant in kansas and certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern united states — account for 69 percent of the reserves associated with these facilities 

closed or sold facilities 

there are 40 sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of opc that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in which opc or its subsidiaries are involved five sites account for 70 percent of the reserves associated with this group the five sites are an active refinery in louisiana where occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in pennsylvania a closed occ chemical plant in pennsylvania a closed landfill in western new york and a water treatment facility at a former occ chemical plant in north carolina 

environmental costs 

occidental’s costs some of which may include estimates relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations are shown below for each segment 

 operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures relate to longerlived improvements in currently operating facilities remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation although total costs may vary in any one year over the long term segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase 

occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately 94 million for 2007 and 100 million for 2008 

foreign investments 

portions of occidental’s assets are located outside of north america occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against risks associated with the locations of these assets at december 31 2006 the carrying value of occidental’s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately 92 billion or approximately 28 percent of occidental’s total assets at that date of such assets approximately 50 billion are located in the middle eastnorth africa approximately 39 billion are located in latin america and substantially all of the remainder are located in the other eastern hemisphere region for the year ended december 31 2006 net sales outside north america totaled 56 billion or approximately 31 percent of total net sales 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the management of occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of occidental’s management there has been no material change to these policies over the past three years the selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

oil and gas properties 

occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found at the completion of drilling activities the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found if no proved reserves have been found the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense in some cases a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells occidentals practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a twelvemonth period after drilling is complete occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 

annual lease rentals and geological geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred 

proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil natural gas and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs 

several factors could change occidental’s recorded oil and gas reserves occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and an additional share for profit occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices in other contractual arrangements sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical estimation of 

future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to changes in the quantity of recorded proved reserves an additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different from those estimated when the reserves were initially recorded occidental’s revisions to proved reserves were positive for 2006 and amounted to less than 1 percent of the total reserves for the year in 2005 revisions to proved reserves were negative and amounted to less than 1 percent of the total reserves for the year in 2004 revisions to proved reserves were positive and amounted to approximately 2 percent of the total reserves additionally occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to sfas no 144 generally when prices decline andor reserve estimates change significantly there have been no sfas no 144 impairments of oil and gas assets over the past three years 

if occidental’s consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above the most significant impact would be on the dda rate for example a 5percent increase in the amount of consolidated oil and gas reserves would change the rate from 835 per barrel to 794 per barrel which would increase pretax income by 88 million annually a 5percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from 835 per barrel to 877 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pretax income of 88 million annually 

dda of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unitofproduction method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves the change in the dda rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial 

a portion of the carrying value of occidental’s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties at december 31 2006 the capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties net of accumulated valuation allowance were 17 billion the acquisition of vintage resulted in an addition of 13 billion of unproved properties in 2006 no goodwill was recorded on this transaction during 2006 approximately 300 million of the unproved property amount was moved to proved properties the unproved amounts are not subject to dda or impairment until a determination is made as to the existence of proven reserves as exploration and development work progresses if reserves on these properties are proven capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion if the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made the timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties if warranted depends upon the nature timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance 

chemical assets 

the most critical accounting policy affecting occidental’s chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its ppe occidentals chemical plants are depreciated using either the unitofproduction or straightline method based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets which range from 3 years to 50 years are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests the estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained without these continued expenditures the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical plants include sustained higher or lower product prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition feedstock costs energy prices environmental regulations and technological changes over the prior three years the change in the depreciation rate due to changes in estimated useful lives has been immaterial 

occidental performs impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets occidental compares the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value the key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition feedstock costs energy costs regulations and remaining estimated useful life impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values 

subsequent to the purchase of the vulcan chemical assets occidental reviewed all of its chemical assets and decided to close its least competitive plants and upgrade the remaining operations as a result of this review occidental recorded a 139 million pretax charge for the writeoff of two previously idled chemical plants and one operating plant and a pretax additional charge of 20 million for the writedown of another chemical plant in 2005 

occidentals net ppe for chemicals is approximately 26 billion and its depreciation expense for 2007 is expected to be approximately 256 million if the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense for example a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pretax earnings by approximately 17 million per year 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience available technology regulations in effect the timing of remediation and costsharing arrangements the environmental reserves are based on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable the reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable as of december 31 2006 and 2005 occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets 

many factors could result in changes to occidental’s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss the most significant are 

 additionally other events might occur that could affect occidental’s future remediation costs such as 

 at sites involving multiple parties occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability when other parties are jointly liable the financial viability of the parties the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating occidentals ultimate share of liability based on these factors occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable in an amount that would have a material effect on occidental’s consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations 

most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories 

category 1 cercla or stateequivalent sites wherein occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations 

category 2 oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost and 

category 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation 

in all three of these categories occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities as adjusted by recognition for any nonperforming parties 

in addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures which often take in excess of ten years at cercla sites occidental’s reserves include management’s estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems to the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a sitespecific basis 

if the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings for example if the reserve balance were to decrease by 10 percent occidental would record a pretax gain of 41 million if the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 41 million 

other loss contingencies 

occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits claims proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet 

these reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate management’s judgments could change based on new information changes in laws or regulations changes in management’s plans or intentions the outcome of legal proceedings settlements or other factors 

significant accounting changes

derivative activities and market risk general 

occidentals market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices and to a lesser extent interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates occidental has entered into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price and rate fluctuations a derivative is an instrument that among other characteristics derives its value from changes in another instrument or variable 

in general the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices dealer quotes and the black scholes or similar valuation models 

commodity price risk general 

occidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices based on current levels of production if oil prices vary overall by 1 per barrel it would have an estimated annual effect on pretax income of approximately 150 million if natural gas prices vary by 025 per mcf it would have an estimated annual effect on pretax income of approximately 51 million if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidental’s results to oil and gas prices also would change 

occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices however changes in cost usually offset part of the effect of price changes on margins if chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by 10ton it would have approximately a 15 million and 30 million pretax annual effect on income respectively if pvc prices vary by 01lb it would have approximately a 25 million pretax annual effect on income if ethylene dichloride edc prices vary by 10ton it would have approximately a 5 million pretax annual effect on income historically price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock price changes therefore the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated according to chemical market associates inc december 2006 average contract prices were chlorine—318ton caustic soda—338ton pvc—055lb and edc—310ton 

marketing and trading operations 

occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas derivatives have been used by occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in commodityrelated cash flows occidental enters into lowrisk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization which operates under established policy controls and procedures with respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations occidental utilizes a combination of futures forwards options and swaps to offset various physical transactions occidentals use of derivatives in marketing and trading activities relates primarily to managing cash flows from thirdparty purchases which includes occidental’s periodic gas storage activities 

risk management 

occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities which include buying selling marketing trading and hedging activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy the chief financial officer and the risk management committee comprising members of occidentals management oversee these controls which are implemented and enforced by the trading control officer the trading control officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities controls for energy commodities include limits on value at risk limits on credit limits on trading segregation of duties delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls 

fair value of marketing and trading derivative contracts 

the following tables reconcile the changes in the net fair value of occidental’s marketing and trading contracts a portion of which are hedges during 2006 and 2005 and segregate the open contracts at december 31 2006 by maturity periods 

    production hedges 

in 2005 occidental entered into a series of fixed price swaps and costless collar agreements that qualify as cashflow hedges for the sale of a portion of its crude oil production additionally occidental acquired oil and gas fixed price and basis swaps with the vintage acquisition these hedges continue to the end of 2011 the 2006 volume that was hedged was less than 4 percent of occidental’s 2006 crude oil and natural gas production information about these cashflow hedges which are included in the total fair value of 355 million in the table above is presented in a tabular presentation below as of december 31 2006 volumes in thousands of barrels 

    quantitative information 

occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commoditybased derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities this method determines the maximum potential negative shortterm change in fair value with a 95percent level of confidence the marketing and trading value at risk was immaterial during all of 2006 

interest rate risk general 

occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its longterm debt obligations in 2005 occidental terminated all of its interestrate swaps that were accounted for as fairvalue hedges these hedges had effectively converted approximately 17 billion of fixedrate debt to variablerate debt the fair value of the swaps at termination resulted in a gain of approximately 20 million which was recorded into income when the debt was paid in 2005 and 2006 the amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement was lower as a result of the swaps and recognition of the gain by approximately 13 million 21 million and 56 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

occidental was a party to a series of forward interestrate locks which qualified as cashflow hedges the hedges were related to the construction of a cogeneration plant leased by occidental that was completed in december 2002 the unamortized loss on the hedges at december 31 2006 was approximately 18 million aftertax which is recorded in accumulated oci and is being recognized in earnings over the lease term of 26 years on a straightline basis 

tabular presentation of interest rate risk in millions of us dollars except rates 

the table below provides information about occidentals debt obligations which are sensitive to changes in interest rates debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date 

  32 

credit risk

volatile global commodity pricing fluctuations beyond occidental’s control strongly affect its revenues profitability operating cash flow and future growth rate 

as discussed in the section entitled derivative activities and market risk — commodity price risk — production hedges occidental’s financial results typically correlate closely to the price it obtains for its products in the global markets in which they compete oil and gas price changes also impact production and reserves because productionsharing contracts pscs typically include terms that adjust occidental’s share of production when prices change and price changes also affect the profitability of production and the economic recoverability of reserves historically prices for occidental’s products have been volatile a significant portion of the oil occidental produces is sour crude and the prices for sour crude tend to be lower in addition the price differential between sweet and sour crude varies based on their respective supply and demand dynamics 

drilling and exploration activity levels inventory levels production disruptions the actions of opec increasing prices or limiting occidentals production price speculation and geophysical and technical limitations affect the global and in some cases local shortterm and longterm supply of oil and gas and interact to contribute to price volatility because of the long lead times associated with drilling and exploration projects occidental may commit significant amounts of capital to oil and gas projects and cannot be certain of the level of demand that will exist when it finishes a project the health of the global economy alternative sources of energy such as coal and efforts at improving or implementing efficient consumption can also affect the demand for oil and gas 

demand for occidental’s chemical products correlates most strongly with the health of the global economy occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals both of which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations 

 

occidental’s businesses operate in a highly competitive environment which affects its profitability and its ability to grow production and replace oil and gas reserves 

occidental’s future oil and gas production and its profitability depend in part on its ability to acquire or find additional reserves at costs below the price at which it can sell the oil and gas it produces from them after operating costs occidental can acquire reserves by purchasing existing production assets or by acquiring exploration rights and successfully drilling wells that produce hydrocarbons in commercial quantities industry competition for reserves may influence occidental to 

  

 rising exploration and development activity in the industry generally increases the demand and therefore the costs of oil and gas services 

participants in the chemical industry compete primarily based on price and the industry consists of many domestic and foreign competitors in addition the industry has historically experienced overexpansion when prices rise 

in both industries occidental uses nonproprietary technology and business management techniques which limits its ability to achieve significant comparative production efficiencies 

 

occidental’s businesses may experience catastrophic occurrences 

natural disasters such as hurricanes occur regularly and may occasionally affect occidental’s businesses in addition well blowouts and oilfield fires armed conflicts civil unrest and industrial accidents may occur and may affect occidental’s businesses occidental maintains insurance against a number of these risks however it partially selfinsures and insurance may not always provide the coverage expected or desired due to contractual limitations unavailability cost of insurance and the insurers financial health 

 

varied governmental and political actions affect occidental’s results of operations 

the transnational character of occidental’s oil and gas business subjects it to the decisions of many governments and political interests as a result occidental faces increased risks of 

 for example the government of ecuador has threatened to terminate occidental’s participation contract for block 15 see ”mda — oil and gas segment — business review — latin america — ecuador” when occidental acquired vintage petroleum inc vintage at the end of january 2006 it gained operations in argentina and bolivia beginning in 2001 argentina increased export taxes on oil and implemented stricter foreign exchange controls mandatory export proceeds repatriation laws export limitations and domestic sales price caps some of which have since expired in 2005 bolivia approved a hydrocarbons bill that introduced a significant new production tax actions such as these may affect occidental’s results of operations financial position or the quantity of its oil and gas reserves 

occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that occasionally have experienced political instability which increases occidental’s risk of loss or delayed production associated with armed conflict civil unrest security problems restrictions on production equipment imports and sanctions that prevent continued operations occidental may face the risk of increased costs if it is perceived not to be respecting or advancing the economic and social progress of the communities in which it operates since occidental’s assets are longlived the magnitude of these risks can vary over the time it operates in a country 

 

occidental faces risks associated with its mergers acquisitions and divestitures 

occidental periodically acquires and divests oil and gas reserves and chemical facilities these activities carry risks that occidental may 

 additionally the assets occidental acquires may not be as profitable as its current asset base 

 

certain of occidental’s major chemical products are coproduced in a fixed ratio which limits its ability to exploit pricing opportunities 

because chlorine and caustic soda must be produced together in a fixed ratio an imbalance in demand between the products ultimately requires occidental to reduce output or cut prices to restore demand balance either action limits occidental’s profits on these commodities 

 

technological developments may reduce the demand for oil and gas 

rising oil and gas prices create incentives to find alternative energy sources and energy conservation measures that could replace or reduce oil and gas consumption over the long term 

 

i nternal r isks 

occidental may incur significant costs in exploration or development efforts which may prove unsuccessful or unprofitable 

occidental may misinterpret geologic or engineering data which may result in significant losses on unsuccessful exploration or development drilling efforts 

occidental bears the risks of project delays and cost overruns due to unexpected geologic conditions equipment failures equipment delivery delays accidents adverse weather government and joint venture partner approval delays construction or startup delays and other associated risks such risks may delay expected production andor increase the costs of production 

 

inadequate cost containment could reduce occidental’s competitiveness 

occidental works to minimize the costs associated with its businesses but the impact of its efforts may not be sufficient to offset any negative effects related to the main elements of cost which consist of reserve acquisition costs for oil and gas and feedstock and energy costs for chemicals

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda incorporating item 7a 

 

in this report the term occidental refers to occidental petroleum corporation opc andor one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest subsidiaries occidental is divided into two segments oil and gas and chemical 

s trategy 

general 

occidental aims to generate competitive total returns to stockholders using the following strategy 

  

occidental prefers to own large longlived legacy oil and gas assets like those in california and the permian basin that tend to have moderate decline rates enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to costeffective production management expects such assets to contribute substantial earnings and cash flow after invested capital 

at occidental maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate abovecostofcapital returns throughout the business cycle during periods of high commodity prices occidental expects to use most of its cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends to improve future earnings by making such investments 

 

the chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy capital is expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound way to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to lower manufacturing costs asset acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chloralkali and pvc businesses historically the chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure requirements occidental intends to invest this cash mainly in strategically attractive assets as part of occidentals strategy to grow its oil and gas business any excess cash generated by the chemical segment may be used as part of the overall funding for oil and gas growth

the oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for finding and development among the lowest in the industry the oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by 

  

over the past several years occidental has strengthened its asset base within each of the core areas occidental has invested in and disposed of assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets see oil and gas segment — business review for a discussion of these changes 

in addition occidental has made acquisitions and investments in the dolphin project in qatar and the uae reentered libya and assumed operations in the mukhaizna field in oman for future growth opportunities not for current production 

occidental’s overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its strategy to enhance the development of mature fields beginning with the acquisition of the elk hills oil and gas field in california followed by a series of purchases in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico 

at the end of 2005 the elk hills and permian basin assets made up 70 percent of occidental’s consolidated proven oil reserves and 45 percent of its consolidated proven gas reserves on a barrels of oil equivalent boe basis they accounted for 64 percent of occidental’s consolidated reserves in 2005 the combined production from these assets averaged approximately 279000 boe per day which represents approximately 49 percent of occidental’s total worldwide production these assets also contributed approximately 48 percent of oil and gas segment earnings

oxychems strategy is to be a lowcost producer so that it can maximize its cash flow generation oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with chlorine which is coproduced with caustic soda and then converts chlorine and ethylene through a series of intermediate products into pvc oxychems focus on chlorovinyls permits it to take advantage of economies of scale 

 

key performance indicators 

general 

occidental seeks to ensure that it meets its strategic goals by continuously measuring its success in maintaining below average debt levels and top quartile performance compared to its peers in 

  

  

debt structure 

occidentals total debt and total debttocapitalization ratios are shown in the table below 

   

as shown occidental’s yearend 2005 total debttocapitalization ratio declined to 17 percent from the 46percent level that existed at the end of 2001 the decrease in the total debttocapitalization ratio in 2005 compared with 2001 resulted from total debt reductions of 38 percent combined with an increase in stockholders equity of 167 percent over the same period 

 

return on equity 

   

occidental has focused on improving its return on equity in 2005 occidentals return on equity was 41 percent and the threeyear average return on equity was 31 percent during the same threeyear period occidental increased its stockholders’ equity by 138 percent and its quarterly dividend by 38 percent and its stock price increased by 181 percent 

o il and g as s egment 

business environment 

oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s financial performance oil prices strengthened in 2005 over 2004 levels during the year occidental experienced an increase in its price differential between the average west texas intermediate wti price and occidentals realized prices however occidental’s realized price as a percentage of wti was 85 percent for both years prices and differentials can vary significantly even on a shortterm basis making forecasting realized prices difficult the average wti market price for 2005 was 5656 per barrel compared with 4140 per barrel in 2004 occidentals average realized price for oil in 2005 was 4820 compared with 3509 in 2004 

average nymex domestic natural gas prices increased approximately 37 percent from 2004 for 2005 nymex gas prices averaged 811mcf compared with 592mcf for 2004

elk hills 

occidental operates the elk hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of california’s san joaquin valley with an approximate 78percent interest the field was acquired in 1998 for 35 billion and is the largest producer of gas in california oil and gas production in 2005 was approximately 90000 boe per day during 2005 occidental performed infill drilling field extensions and recompletions identified by advanced reservoir characterization techniques a record 291 new wells were drilled and 548 wells were worked over in addition a successful co 2 pilot was completed during the year as a result of these activities occidental was able to maintain production at 2004 levels since its acquisition total elk hills oil and gas production has been approximately 268 million boe at the end of 2005 the property had an estimated 505 million boe of proved reserves compared to the 425 million boe that were recorded at the time of the acquisition 

 

permian basin 

the permian basin extends throughout southwest texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states with the entire basin accounting for approximately 18 percent of total united states oil production occidental is the largest producer in the permian basin with an approximately 16 percent net share of the total permian basin oil production occidental also produces and processes natural gas and natural gas liquids ngl in the permian basin 

most of occidentals permian basin interests were obtained through the acquisition of altura in 2000 for approximately 36 billion 

in 2005 occidental made several additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing property interests for approximately 17 billion this was partially offset by cash proceeds totaling 171 million from dispositions of a portion of the acquired properties 

 

occidentals total share of permian basin oil gas and ngl production averaged 189000 boe per day in 2005 compared to 175000 boe per day in 2004 at the end of 2005 occidentals permian basin properties had 12 billion boe in proved reserves occidentals permian basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas the largest producing areas in 2005 included wasson san andres slaughter levelland north cowden and wasson clearfork which contributed 20 percent 10 percent 5 percent 5 percent and 4 percent respectively to occidental’s 2005 permian boe production 

occidental’s interests in the permian basin offer additional development and exploitation potential during 2005 occidental drilled approximately 250 wells on its operated properties and participated in wells drilled on outside operated interests occidental conducted significant development activity on five co 2 projects during 2005 including implementation of new floods and expansion of existing co 2 floods occidental also focused on improving performance of existing wells occidental had an average of 105 well service units working in the permian area during 2005 performing well maintenance and workovers 

approximately 60 percent of occidental’s permian basin oil production is from fields that actively employ the application of carbon dioxide co 2  flood technology an enhanced oil recovery technique this involves injecting co 2 into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent causing the oil to flow more freely into producing wells the size of these co 2 flood operations makes occidental a world leader in the application of this technology 

 

thums 

occidental purchased thums the field contractor for an oil production unit offshore long beach california in 2000 occidentals share of production from thums is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc whereby occidentals share of production varies inversely with oil prices for 2005 production from thums averaged 18000 barrels per day 

 

gulf of mexico 

occidental has a onethird interest in the deepwater horn mountain oil field which is occidentals only asset in the gulf of mexico bp plc bp is the operator for 2005 occidentals production at horn mountain averaged 14000 boe per day in the second half of 2005 the horn mountain field was shut down for about 47 days due to the impact of the hurricanes in the gulf of mexico 

 

hugoton and other 

occidental owns other oil and gas interests including a large concentration of gas reserves production interests and royalty interests in the hugoton area of kansas and oklahoma the hugoton field is the largest natural gas field discovered in north america occidental’s hugoton and other operations produced 133 mmcf of natural gas per day and 3000 barrels of oil per day in 2005 

occidental has over 28000 net acres in the piceance basin in western colorado during 2004 and 2005 occidental drilled 30 development wells installed a 50 mmcf per day gas processing facility and the infrastructure required for future field development occidental has acquired seismic data covering 34 square miles of the cascade creek field 

 

acquisition of vintage petroleum 

in january 2006 occidental completed the merger of vintage petroleum inc vintage into a whollyowned occidental subsidiary occidental acquired producing assets in argentina the united states yemen and bolivia the argentine assets consist of 22 concessions 19 of which occidental will operate located in the san jorge basin in southern argentina and the cuyo basin in western argentina occidental paid 14 billion to former vintage shareholders for the cash portion of the merger consideration and issued 28 million shares for the stock portion which was valued at 21 billion the value of occidental’s shares was determined by the average share price for the fiveday period beginning two days before the acquisition announcement in addition occidental assumed vintage’s debt which had an estimated fair market value of 585 million at closing occidental intends to divest a portion of these assets

dolphin project 

occidentals investment in the dolphin project which was acquired in 2002 consists of two separate economic interests held through two separate legal entities one entity oxy dolphin ep llc owns a 245percent undivided interest in the assets and liabilities associated with a development and production sharing agreement dpsa with the government of qatar to develop and produce natural gas and condensate in qatar’s north field for 25 years from the start of production with a provision to request a 5year extension the purchase price of the undivided working interest in the dpsa was approximately 60 million and was recorded in property plant  equipment this undivided interest is proportionately consolidated in occidentals financial statements 

a second entity oxy dolphin pipeline llc owns 245 percent of the stock of dolphin energy limited dolphin energy the purchase price of dolphin energy stock totaled approximately 250 million and was recorded as an equity investment 

dolphin energy is the operator under the dpsa on behalf of the three dpsa contractors including occidental dolphin energy also has the rights to build own and operate a 260milelong 48inch natural gas pipeline which will transport dry natural gas from qatar to the uae 

the dolphin project is expected to cost approximately 40 billion in total occidental expects to invest approximately 1 billion of this total the project will be financed by a combination of participant investment and project financing during 2006 occidental expects to spend a combined total of approximately 430 million for the gas exploration and 

 

development activity and the investment in dolphin energy compared to 380 million in 2005 

in 2003 the government of qatar approved the final field development plan for the dolphin project construction of a gas processing and compression plant at ras laffan in qatar as well as two offshore gas production platforms commenced in 2004 and is continuing the projected startup date for production is late 2006 

based on existing supply contracts the dolphin project is expected to export approximately 2 billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas per day plus associated liquids and byproducts however the pipeline is expected to have capacity to transport up to 32 bcf of natural gas per day demand for natural gas in the uae and oman continues to grow and dolphin energy’s customers have requested additional gas supplies to help fulfill this growing demand dolphin energy will pursue an agreement to secure an additional supply of gas from qatar 

to date occidental has recorded 250 million boe of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the dolphin project dpsa activity no revenue or production costs were recorded in 2005 for the dolphin project gas exploration and development activity 

 

qatar 

in addition to the dolphin project occidental participates in two production projects in qatar idd el shargi north dome isnd and idd el shargi south dome issd occidental is nearing completion of phase ii of full field development of isnd and is in the process of developing the issd field 

occidental expects to continue increasing production and recoverable reserves under its existing agreement in the isnd field phase ii is targeting the development and recovery of additional reserves by applying advanced drilling systems and improved reservoir characterization techniques capital expenditures in qatar for the issd and isnd projects were 343 million in 2005 and are expected to be 268 million in 2006 

occidental’s net share of combined production from the two fields averaged 42000 barrels per day in 2005 

 

yemen 

in yemen occidental owns a 38 percent directworking interest in the masila field in block 14 and a 404percent interest in the east shabwa field comprising a 286percent directworking interest and an 118percent equity interest in an unconsolidated entity occidental’s production averaged 28000 barrels of oil per day in 2005 with 24000 coming from the masila field and the remainder from east shabwa in addition occidental is the operator of block 20 where it owns an 80percent working interest 

in july 2005 occidental was the successful bidder for block 75 in yemen’s exploration bid round and has been invited to finalize a psc for the block 

 

oman 

occidentals oman business includes block 9 and block 27 where it holds a 65percent working interest in each and block 53 where it holds a 45percent working interest occidental is the operator of all three blocks where production averaged 24000 boe per day in 2005 with 23000 boe coming from block 9 and the remainder from block 53 the block 9 agreement provides for two tenyear extensions and occidental has agreed with the government of oman to the first tenyear extension through december 7 2015 

in march 2004 occidental began selling gas to the government of oman under a gas sales agreement thereby allowing occidental to produce previously stranded gas and condensates from block 9 under the agreement occidental and its block 9 partner must supply approximately 114 mmcf per day of natural gas until december 31 2007 thereafter occidental will nominate quantities that it has available for delivery in 2005 occidental and its partner supplied an average of approximately 116 mmcf per day of natural gas to the government under the gas sales agreement the minimum gross quantities to be delivered under the gas sales agreement through december 31 2007 represent approximately 93 percent of the expected average gross production of gas from block 9 during that period as of december 31 2005 the gross proved gas reserves from block 9 are approximately 373 percent of the total minimum of gas that remains to be delivered under the gas sales agreement 

in october 2005 occidental received approval for development of the khamilah field in block 27 the exploitation term of the agreement is 30 years beginning in september 2005 occidental plans to develop the reserves and commence production in block 27 through capitalefficient investment and exploration 

occidental and its block 53 partners signed a new psc for the mukhaizna field with the government of the sultanate of oman in july 2005 on september 1 2005 occidental assumed operations of the mukhaizna field where it holds a 45percent working interest the mukhaizna field located in oman’s south central interior was discovered in 1975 and was brought into production in 2000 primary production peaked in the same year at 15000 barrels of oil per day and by september 2005 had declined to 8500 barrels of oil per day occidental plans to use horizontal well steamflood technology to steadily increase production 

 

libya 

occidental suspended all activities in libya in 1986 as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the united states government during the imposition of sanctions occidental derived no economic benefit from its libyan interests in 2004 the united states government lifted all of the principal economic sanctions against libya however libya continues to be designated as a country supporting international terrorism under section 6j of the united states export administration act and as such continues to be subject to certain limited sanctions 

 

on august 11 2005 the libyan authorities approved the terms of occidental’s participation in the assets that it left in 1986 effective as of july 1 2005 the agreement allows occidental to return to its libyan operations on generally the same terms in effect when activities were suspended those assets consist of three producing contracts in the sirte basin and four exploration blocks occidental paid approximately 133 million in reentry bonuses capital adjustment and workinprogress payments and is required to pay 10 million per year while it continues to operate in libya as reimbursements for past development costs associated with the historical assets in addition occidental committed to spend 90 million over the next five years in the four exploration blocks currently occidental’s rights in the producing fields extend through 2009 and early 2010 occidental had its first lifting from its libyan operations in late september and production during the fourth quarter of 2005 averaged 24000 boe per day 

separately in early 2005 occidental participated in the epsa iv exploration bid round in libya occidental successfully bid on nine of the 15 areas available occidental is the operator for five onshore areas and has a 90percent exploration working interest in addition occidental holds a 35percent exploration working interest in four offshore areas woodside petroleum ltd is the operator for the offshore areas occidental paid approximately 90 million in exploration lease bonuses for these nine new areas and committed to spend an additional 125 million over the next five years

in september 2005 occidental signed a new agreement with ecopetrol for an enhanced oil recovery project in the la cirainfantas field located in central colombia if conditions warrant upon completion of the two pilot phases occidental will earn a 48 percent net share of production upon further development 

in november 2005 ecopetrol approved development of the caricare field an exploration discovery under the rondon association contract adjacent to caño limón production from this field where occidental holds a 35percent working interest is expected to commence in may 2006 

occidental holds various working interests in two additional exploration blocks 

 

ecuador 

occidental operates block 15 in ecuador in which it holds a 60percent economic interest although occidental holds legal title to 100 percent of the block 15 participation contract it farmed out 40 percent of its economic interest related to block 15 in 2000 occidentals share of production averaged approximately 42000 barrels of oil per day in 2005 in addition occidental has a 14percent interest in the oleoducto de crudos pesados ltd ocp oil export pipeline 

development of existing fields primarily edenyuturi and the indillana complex continued through 2005 drilling and the installation of new wells nearly offset the natural decline of existing wells 

foreign oil companies including occidental have been paying a value added tax vat generally calculated on the basis of 10 to 12 percent of expenditures for goods and services used in the production of oil for export until 2001 oil companies like other companies producing products for export filed for and received reimbursement of vat in 2001 the ecuador tax authority announced that the oil companies’ vat payments did not qualify for reimbursement in 2002 occidental initiated an international arbitration proceeding against the ecuadorian government under the united statesecuador bilateral investment treaty based on occidental’s belief that the ecuadorian government is arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refund the vat to occidental in july 2004 a tribunal of international arbitrators awarded occidental compensation for vat refunds from occidentals block 15 operations that were withheld by the ecuadorian government and indicated that similar vat refunds should be paid going forward the ecuadorian government has appealed the tribunals decision and the appeals proceedings continue at present in the event of an unfavorable outcome the potential effect on occidentals financial statements would not be material 

in september 2004 occidental received formal notification that petroecuador the state oil company of ecuador was initiating proceedings to determine if occidental had violated either its participation contract for block 15 or the ecuadorian hydrocarbons law and whether the alleged violations constitute grounds for terminating the participation contract block 15 operations represent approximately 7 percent of occidentals 2005 consolidated production 4 percent of its proved consolidated reserves and 2 percent of its total property plant and equipment ppe net of accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization dda in august 2005 petroecuador issued a report 

 

recommending that the minister of energy declare the termination of occidental’s participation contract for block 15 the principal allegation stated in the notice and the petroecuador report is an assertion that occidental should have obtained government approval for the farmout agreement entered into in 2000 in november 2005 the minister of energy following the procedure set forth in the ecuadorian hydrocarbons law requested that occidental respond to the allegations against it in february 2006 occidental submitted its response to the minister of energy in which occidental confirmed its belief that it has complied with all material obligations under the participation contract and ecuadorian law and that any termination of the contract based upon the stated allegations would be unfounded and would constitute an unlawful expropriation occidental has been cooperating with the ecuadorian authorities in these proceedings and will continue to strive for an amicable resolution occidental currently is unable to determine the outcome of these proceedings but if there were to be a negotiated settlement it is probable that the terms would effectively reduce the future profitability of block 15 operations see also offbalancesheet arrangements — ecuador for further information about the ocp pipeline 

 

productionsharing contracts 

occidental conducts its operations in qatar oman and yemen under pscs and under such contracts receives a share of production to recover its costs and an additional share for profit in addition occidentals share of production from thums is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc occidental’s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 

 

proved reserves  evaluation and review process 

a senior corporate officer of occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data in addition a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee has been established consisting of senior corporate officers to monitor and review occidentals oil and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidentals board of directors periodically throughout the year occidental retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum engineering consultants to review its oil and gas reserve estimation processes in 2004 and 2005 

ryder scott compared occidental’s methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry standards and reviewed certain data methods and procedures used in estimating reserve volumes the economic evaluations and reserve classifications ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of occidental’s total reserves portfolio 

based on this review including the data technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott concluded that the methodologies used by occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current securities and exchange commission sec standards ryder scott was not engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes presented by occidental 

 

proved reserve additions 

occidental consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at yearend 2005 of 2662 million boe as compared with the yearend 2004 amount of 2489 million boe additionally occidental’s investments in other interests had proved reserves of 45 million and 43 million boe at yearend 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in the consolidated subsidiaries’ reserves from all sources was 380 million boe of which 232 million boe were from proved developed reserves and 148 million boe were from proved undeveloped reserves 

 

proved developed reserves represent approximately 74 percent of occidental’s total proved reserves 

 

proved reserve additions  consolidated subsidiaries  2005 

  

proved reserves are 78 percent crude oil and condensate and 22 percent natural gas 

 

revisions of previous estimates 

in 2005 occidental had net negative revisions of its proved reserves of 26 million boe due to changes in price the decrease was mainly due to negative revisions of 52 million boe from the dolphin project qatar oman and yemen where reserve amounts decrease when prices rise these revisions were partially offset by positive revisions at domestic operations in elk hills and the permian basin if oil prices increased by 5 per barrel less oil volume is required to recover costs and pscs would reduce occidentals share of proved reserves by approximately 7 million boe conversely if oil prices dropped by 5 per barrel occidentals share of proved reserves would increase by a similar amount oil price changes would also tend to affect the economic lives of proved reserves from other contracts in a manner partially offsetting the psc reserve volume changes apart from the effects of product prices occidentals approach to interpreting technical data regarding oil and gas reserves makes it more likely future reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative 

 

improved recovery 

in 2005 occidental added reserves of 139 million boe through improved recovery mainly in the permian basin elk hills and thums in the united states and also in qatar in an effort to partially mitigate the decline in oil and gas production from the elk hills field 

 

occidental has successfully implemented an infill drilling program the elk hills operations employ both gas flood and water flood techniques in the permian basin the increased reserves were primarily attributable to enhanced recovery techniques such as drilling additional co 2 flood and water flood wells 

 

extensions and discoveries 

occidental obtains reserve additions from extensions which are dependent on successful exploitation programs in 2005 occidental added reserves of 123 million boe with 23 million boe in the united states and 91 million boe in the middle east in western colorado occidental added approximately 9 million boe from the extension of gas reserves to proved locations most of which will require additional development capital 

the success of improved recovery extension and discovery projects depends on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements as well as oil and gas prices capital costs and operating costs many of these factors are outside of managements control and will affect whether or not these historical sources of reserve additions continue at similar levels 

 

purchases of proved reserves 

in 2005 occidental purchased reserves of 139 million boe of which 135 million boe are in the united states the reserve additions in the united states were from various acquisitions primarily in the permian basin of which 71 percent were proved developed reserves occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at reasonable prices acquisitions are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil and gas contracts at attractive terms as market conditions change the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly 

 

proved undeveloped reserves 

in 2005 occidentals proved undeveloped reserves increased by 148 million boe this net increase resulted from improved recovery extensions discoveries and purchases primarily in the elk hills field in the permian basin in western colorado and in the dolphin project the dolphin project accounted for 63 percent of the 2005 increase and the projected startup for dolphin production is late 2006 these proved undeveloped additions were partially offset by reserve transfers to the proved developed category as a result of 2005 development programs 

for details of proved reserve activity by geographic areas see the supplemental oil and gas information unaudited section in item 8 

 

industry outlook 

the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather inventory levels competing fuel prices overall demand and the availability of supply 

worldwide oil prices in 2005 remained at or near historical highs continued economic growth resulting in increased demand and concerns about supply availability could result in continued high prices a lower demand growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices 

historically sustained high or low oil prices have significantly affected profitability and returns for occidental and other upstream producers oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty the wti price has averaged approximately 2878 per barrel over the past ten years however the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations in prices during 2005 occidental experienced an increase in its price differential of the average wti price over occidentals realized prices see the oil and gas segment — business environment section above for further information 

while local supplydemand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term daytoday prices may be more volatile in the futures markets such as on the nymex and other exchanges making it difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence over the last ten years the nymex gas price has averaged 404 per mcf 

 

c hemical s egment 

business environment 

the chemical segment experienced improved results in 2005 due to sustained demand coupled with improved margins despite sharply higher feedstock costs the widespread impact of hurricanes katrina and rita in the third quarter caused several disruptions among chloralkali producers and their customers this resulted in a moderate softening of product demand 

 

business review 

chloralkali 

demand for chloralkali products began the year quite strong which enabled oxychem to realize robust margins despite escalating energy and raw material costs while chlorine and caustic prices continued to rise throughout the year the combination of softening demand partly due to hurricanes katrina and rita and the rapid rise in energy and feedstock costs caused operating rates and profitability to fall in the latter part of the year key sectors such as vinyls and pulp and paper were operating at full capacity in the first half resulting in a tight supplydemand balance for chlorine and caustic soda although demand remained relatively strong in the second half of the year margins came under pressure as product became more available and industrial customers reduced purchases to control inventories and bolster cash flow 

domestic chlorine demand fell 7 percent compared to 2004 as several sectors experienced slowdowns late in the year which resulted in destocking of inventory amid the expectation of lower prices despite starting the year operating at near capacity 2005 chloralkali industry operating rates fell to 90 percent for the year down from 99 percent in 2004 oxychem’s chloralkali operating rate for 2005 was 92 percent slightly above the industry operating rate of 90 percent 

in september 2005 oxychem decided to permanently close its deer park texas and delaware city delaware chloralkali production facilities and its 

 

edc facility in ingleside texas these sites were closed because they were not expected to regain an economically viable operating position in the future 

 

vinyls 

increasing ethylene and natural gas prices led to a continuation of industry pvc price increases in 2005 industry pvc prices increased 24 percent compared to 2004 these increases led to record high price levels in the fourth quarter of 2005 

industrywide total 2005 demand was 3 percent lower compared with 2004 

oxychem operated its pvc facilities at an average operating rate of 88 percent for 2005 compared to the north american industry average of 89 percent 

in december 2005 oxychem announced that it would permanently close its alberta canada pvc manufacturing facility in the first quarter of 2006 

 

acquisition of vulcan assets 

in june 2005 occidental completed the purchase of three chloralkali chemical manufacturing facilities from vulcan for 214 million in cash plus contingent payments based upon the future performance of these facilities and the assumption of certain liabilities in order to facilitate receipt of regulatory approval for this acquisition occidental divested one of the facilities 

 

exit of vinyl specialty resins business 

at the end of 2004 occidental decided to exit the vinyl specialty resins business for strategic and economic reasons this resulted in the immediate closure of the pottstown pennsylvania manufacturing facility occidental recorded an aftertax charge of 32 million in 2004 and classified this business as a discontinued operation 

 

industry outlook 

occidentals chemical business experienced improved profitability in 2005 47 percent higher than 2004’s earnings the major factors that contributed to this improved performance were the continued strong united states economy higher margins and the acquisition of certain vulcan chemical operating assets 

continued strong performance will depend on global economic activity the competitiveness of the united states in the world economy and the direction of the unprecedented high levels of feedstock and energy prices and their impact on margins reduced demand due to softening in the united states economy and continuation of the historically high levels of feedstock and energy prices could affect operating margins and reduce future profitability 

construction of lng terminals on the united states gulf coast could stabilize natural gas prices at a lowerthancurrent level and thereby help improve the competitive position of efficient gulf coast chemical facilities however this construction may not occur in the immediate future 

 

chloralkali 

industry operating rates ended 2005 at 90 percent of capacity which is a considerable decline from 2004’s performance of 99 percent demand growth is expected to be moderate despite the potential positive effect of gulf coast rebuilding efforts however due to the currently high level of energy and other key raw material costs margins are expected to remain under pressure moreover a significant portion of 2005 results were due to sharply higher caustic soda prices versus 2004 this price increase has led to additional united states imports and intense competition among producers for market share 

 

vinyls 

industrywide pvc operating rates are expected to be slightly lower in 2006 as a result of the restart of some idled capacity coupled with lower housing starts and reduced exports vcm rates are expected to improve as dow chemical company completes the announced shutdown of two production facilities 

the growing cost disparity in the vinyls chain between the united states gulf coast and southeast asia as well as the growth of acetylenebased pvc capacity in china have resulted in a dramatic shift in trade flows and imports of pvc into the united states and latin america 

c orporate and o ther 

corporate and other includes the investments in lyondell chemical company lyondell and premcor inc premcor and a leased cogeneration facility in taft louisiana the premcor investment was sold in 2005 beginning in 2004 corporate and other also included the results of a 1300mile oil pipeline and gathering system located in the permian basin which was acquired in january 2004 and is used in corporatedirected oil and gas marketing and trading operations 

 

lyondell 

in november 2004 lyondell acquired millennium chemicals inc millennium by issuing additional shares of lyondell common stock under sec staff accounting bulletin no 51 occidental was required to record its share of the increase in lyondells net equity resulting from this issuance the effect of this was an increase in the carrying value of occidentals investment in lyondell and a pretax gain of 121 million as a result of the stock issuance occidentals ownership percentage of lyondell decreased from approximately 22 percent to 17 percent 

 

in 2005 occidental sold 11 million shares of lyondell common stock for gross proceeds of approximately 300 million this sale resulted in a 2005 pretax gain of 140 million at december 31 2005 occidental still owned 303 million shares of lyondell common stock 12 percent ownership with a carrying value of 468 million and a fair market value of 722 million and warrants to purchase an additional five million shares of lyondell common stock occidental has no current plans to divest the remaining lyondell shares however occidental regularly reviews and analyzes its investments and other operations in order to determine how its stockholders’ interests are best served occidental continues to account for this investment on the equity method since it has the ability to exercise significant influence over lyondell 

 

premcor 

in 2005 valero energy corp valero and premcor executed a merger agreement for valero to acquire premcor occidental tendered its 9 million shares of premcor common stock for cash and shares of valero common stock pursuant to the premcorvalero agreement valero’s acquisition of premcor resulted in a 704 million pretax gain and the subsequent sale of all of the valero shares received resulted in an additional 22 million pretax gain 

 

s egment r esults of o perations 

the following discussion of occidental’s two operating segments and corporate items should be read in conjunction with note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

segment earnings generally exclude interest income interest expense unallocated corporate expenses discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and results from the segments equity investments 

as of january 1 2005 occidental revised its reporting of segment earnings to show segment earnings before income taxes all domestic and foreign income tax expense is now reflected in the “corporate and other” column this change has been retrospectively applied to prior period results 

the following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items 

 

   

  

   

core earnings in 2005 were 63 billion compared with 43 billion in 2004 the increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher prices and volumes for crude oil and natural gas partially offset by higher operating expenses higher exploration expense and increased dda rates 

core earnings in 2004 were 43 billion compared with 32 billion in 2003 the increase in core earnings primarily reflects the effect of higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher crude oil volumes partially offset by higher operating expenses higher exploration expense and increased dda rates 

average consolidated production costs for 2005 were 871 per boe compared to the average 2004 production cost of 695 per boe at least 62 percent of the increase was a result of higher energy prices which increased utility gas plant and co 2 costs and ad valorem taxes and the impact of higher crude oil prices on pscs the remaining cost increases were the result of workover maintenance and other costs 

occidental expects the first quarter 2006 production to be higher than the fourth quarter 2005 production 

also see productionsharing contracts above 

 

   

core earnings in 2005 were 777 million compared with 414 million in 2004 the increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher margins resulting from higher prices for chlorine caustic soda and pvc resins partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs 

core earnings were 414 million in 2004 compared with 223 million in 2003 the increase in core earnings reflects the impact of higher prices for most major products pvc resins edc chlorine and vcm partially offset by higher energy and ethylene costs 

 

s ignificant i tems a ffecting e arnings 

occidental’s results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature timing and amount therefore management uses a measure called core earnings which excludes those items this nongaap measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management’s performance but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing occidental’s earnings performance between periods reported earnings are considered representative of management’s performance over the long term core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

 

   

t axes 

deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets of 11 billion were 08 billion at december 31 2005 the current portion of the deferred tax assets of 200 million is included in prepaid expenses and other the net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of taxable temporary differences 

 

worldwide effective tax rate 

the following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for reported income from continuing operations and core earnings 

 

   

occidentals 2005 worldwide effective tax rate was 28 percent for reported income and 41 percent for core income the decrease in the united states income tax rate for reported income in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted from a 335 million tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required as united states corporate returns for tax years 19982000 became closed due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations and a 619 million tax benefit resulting from a closing agreement with the irs resolving certain foreign tax credit issues the lower united states income tax rate in 2005 and 2004 compared to 2003 resulted from the crediting of foreign income taxes previously occidental deducted foreign income taxes in determining united states taxable income an annual tax election permits a taxpayer to claim either a credit or a deduction for foreign income taxes whichever is more beneficial occidental expects to continue its election to credit foreign income taxes in future years 

 

c onsolidated r esults of o perations 

 

  

the increase in net sales in 2005 compared to 2004 reflects higher crude oil natural gas and chemical prices 

the increase in sales in 2004 compared to 2003 reflects higher crude oil natural gas and chemical prices higher crude oil production and higher chemical volumes partially offset by lower domestic natural gas production volumes 

the increase in interest dividends and other income in 2005 compared to 2004 reflects interest income earned on a higher level of cash and cash equivalents 

the increase in interest dividends and other income in 2004 compared to 2003 is due to 2004 interest income earned from a loan made to an equity investee and a marktomarket income adjustment for equity investee stock warrants 

gain on disposition of assets net in 2005 includes a gain of 726 million resulting from valero’s acquisition of premcor and the subsequent sale of all of the valero shares received and a gain of 140 million on the sale of 11 million shares of lyondell stock 

 

   

cost of sales increased in 2005 compared to 2004 mainly due to higher oil and gas production costs and higher energy and feedstock costs 

cost of sales increased in 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to higher oil and gas production volumes and other operating costs higher energy and feedstock costs and higher crude oil volumes 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to the chemical plant writeoffs and writedowns in 2005 higher costs in oil and gas including higher productionrelated taxes and increases in sharebased compensation expense 

selling general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2004 compared to 2003 mainly due to higher general and administrative costs for corporate infrastructure and general support areas and higher oil and gas costs including higher productionrelated taxes and other operating costs 

 

dda increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to higher costs of new reserve additions resulting in a higher dda rate 

the increase in dda in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to the increase in oil and gas production from the prior year and a higher dda rate 

the increase in exploration expense in 2005 compared to 2004 was due mostly to higher dry hole writeoffs and impairment costs and higher seismic and geological and geophysical costs 

the increase in exploration expense in 2004 compared to 2003 was due mostly to higher dry hole writeoffs and impairment costs in california and the other eastern hemisphere region 

interest and debt expense in 2005 2004 and 2003 included pretax debt purchase charges of 42 million 17 million and 61 million respectively excluding the effects of these debt repayment charges interest expense increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to higher interest rates which were partially offset by lower debt levels interest and debt expense decreased in 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to lower average debt levels 

 

  

the increase in the provision for income taxes in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes partially offset by a 335 million tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required as united states corporate returns for tax years 19982000 became closed due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations and a 619 million tax benefit related to the resolution of certain irs tax issues 

the increase in the provision for income taxes in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes partially offset by the use of a lower tax rate in 2004 resulting from the crediting of foreign income taxes see the taxes section above for further information 

the increase in income from equity investments in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to improved results from the lyondell equity investment and higher income from a russian oil and gas equity investee 

the increase in the income from equity investments in 2004 compared to results reported in 2003 was mostly attributable to improved results from lyondell and higher income from a russian oil and gas equity investee 

the gain on lyondell stock issuance in 2004 represents occidentals share of the increase in lyondells net equity resulting from lyondells issuance of stock to purchase millennium 

 

c onsolidated a nalysis of f inancial p osition 

 

the changes in the following components of occidental’s balance sheet are discussed below 

 

  

the following analysis discusses increases and decreases in balance sheet items by comparing the balance at december 31 2005 to the balance at december 31 2004 unless otherwise indicated 

 

assets 

see “cash flow analysis” for discussion about the increase in cash and cash equivalents the increase in trade receivables is due to higher product prices and oil and gas sales volumes during the fourth quarter 2005 versus 2004 the increase in receivables from joint ventures partnerships and other was due to higher marktomarket adjustments on derivative financial instruments and higher account balances related to the oil and gas marketing and trading operations the higher balance in inventories is due to higher oil and gas marketing and trading inventory due to higher prices and volumes during the fourth quarter 2005 versus 2004 the higher inventory balance is also due to an increase in chemical inventories 

the increase in longterm receivables reflects higher marktomarket adjustments on longterm derivative financial instruments the decrease in investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries is due to the sale of all of the shares of premcor common stock and a partial sale of the lyondell stock during the year the increase in property plant and equipment reflects capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by dda expense 

 

liabilities and stockholders equity 

 

debt to capitalization a 

 

  

the decrease in current maturities of longterm debt and capital lease liabilities reflects the 2005 payment of the 765percent senior notes that were classified as current in 2004 the higher balance in accounts payable is due to higher prices and volumes for purchased oil and gas in occidental’s marketing and trading operations the increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to higher marktomarket adjustments on derivative financial instruments and higher accruals mainly related to the vulcan acquisition 

the higher balance in domestic and foreign income taxescurrent reflects additional taxes payable due to higher income the lower balance for longterm debt is due to various debt redemptions and repurchases throughout the year the decrease in deferred credits and other liabilities – income taxes reflects the reduction in deferred taxes resulting from derivative activity in other comprehensive income oci related to the production hedges and the sale of all of the shares of valero common stock the higher balance in deferred credits and other liabilities – other is due to an increase in longterm derivative liabilities related to crude oil production hedges accruals related to the permian basin and vulcan acquisitions and additional stockbased compensation liabilities partially offset by the reduction in liabilities related to the irs settlement and the reversal of tax reserves no longer required due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations 

the increase in stockholders’ equity reflects higher net income partially offset by dividends paid and the impact of the crude oil production hedges in oci 

 

l iquidity and c apital r esources 

at december 31 2005 occidental had approximately 24 billion in cash and shortterm investments on hand an increase of almost 1 billion from 2004 although income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and production occidental believes that cash and shortterm investments on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs capital expenditure requirements dividend payments potential acquisitions and its announced common stock repurchase program if needed occidental could access its existing credit facilities 

available but unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately 15 billion at december 31 2005 occidentals 15 billion bank credit matures on june 18 2009 none of occidentals committed bank credits contain material adverse change mac clauses or debt rating triggers that could restrict occidentals ability to borrow under these lines occidentals credit facilities and debt agreements do not contain rating triggers that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings downgrade 

at december 31 2005 under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements occidentals capacity for additional unsecured borrowing was approximately 346 billion and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on and for acquisitions of occidentals capital stock was approximately 130 billion assuming that such dividends distributions and acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowing 

in 2005 occidental redeemed all of its 5875percent senior notes due 2007 all of its 4101percent mediumterm senior notes due 2007 all of its 765percent senior notes due 2006 and three of its unsecured subsidiary notes due 2028 through 2030 in addition occidental purchased and retired a total of 213 million of its 675percent senior notes due 2012 its 10125percent senior notes due 2009 its 4percent mediumterm senior notes due 2007 and its 425percent mediumterm senior notes due 2010 

in january 2004 occidental redeemed all of its outstanding 816 percent trust preferred redeemable securities trust preferred securities at par plus accrued interest resulting in a decrease in current liabilities of 453 million in the third quarter of 2004 occidental redeemed all of its 65percent senior notes which reduced longterm debt by approximately 157 million 

in july 2004 dolphin energy the operator of the dolphin project entered into an agreement with banks to provide a 136 billion bridge loan for the dolphin project occidental guaranteed 245 percent of the obligations of dolphin energy under the bridge loan in july 2005 dolphin energy entered into an agreement with banks to refinance the 136 billion bridge loan with a new bridge loan in an amount of 245 billion the proceeds of the new bridge loan were used to pay off amounts outstanding on the 136 billion bridge loan and will be used to fund the construction of the dolphin project the new bridge loan has a term of four years and is a revolving credit facility which may be converted to a term loan in september 2005 dolphin energy entered into an agreement with banks to provide a 10 billion islamiclawcompliant facility to fund the construction of a certain portion of the dolphin project 

 

this fouryear financing facility is structured as a transaction in which dolphin energy constructs part of the midstream portion of the dolphin project on behalf of a group of islamic investors and enters into a lease to use such assets upon construction completion occidental guarantees 245 percent of both of these obligations of dolphin energy at december 31 2005 occidental’s portion of the bridge loan drawdown was approximately 400 million of which 299 million is recorded on the balance sheet the remaining amount is discussed in “offbalancesheet arrangements — guarantees” below there were no draw downs on the islamiclawcompliant facility at december 31 2005 

in the first quarter of 2005 occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to 15 billion of various securities as of december 31 2005 no securities had been issued under this shelf 

in january 2006 occidental completed the vintage acquisition and paid 14 billion to former vintage shareholders for the cash portion of the merger consideration and issued 28 million shares for the stock portion which was valued at 21 billion the value of occidental’s shares was determined by the average share price for the fiveday period beginning two days before the acquisition announcement in addition occidental assumed vintage’s debt which had an estimated fair market value of 585 million at closing occidental intends to divest a portion of these assets 

 

  

the significant increase in operating cash flow in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted from several factors the most important drivers were the significantly higher oil and natural gas prices and to a much lesser extent chemical prices although the changes in realized prices varied among the regions in which occidental operates in 2005 occidentals realized oil prices were higher overall by 37 percent occidental’s realized natural gas price increased over 33 percent in the united states where approximately 80 percent of occidental’s natural gas was produced in 2005 

increases in the costs of producing oil and gas such as purchased goods and services and higher utility gas plant and production taxes partially offset oil and gas sales price increases but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized price increases other cost elements such as labor costs and overheads are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term 

most major chemical prices increased in 2005 at a higher rate than the energydriven increase in feedstock and power costs thereby improving profits and cash flow the overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes not only because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment but also because of increases in energy pricedriven feedstock and electric power costs which are major elements of manufacturing cost for the chemical segments products sales volumes for chemical products generally were higher in 2005 but this did not have a significant effect on occidentals earnings and cash flow 

the significant increase in operating cash flow in 2004 compared to 2003 resulted from the significantly higher oil and natural gas prices and to a much lesser extent chemical prices in 2004 occidentals realized oil prices were higher overall by 29 percent and the realized united states natural gas price increased over 11 percent oil and gas worldwide production on a boe basis increased for 2004 overall by over 3 percent on a daily basis as compared with 2003 which also contributed to increased cash flow 

increases in sales prices realized for occidentals major chemical product lines ranged from zero to 34 percent compared to 2003 chemical prices increased in 2004 at a higher rate than the energydriven increase in feedstock and power costs thereby improving profits and cash flow the overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes sales volumes for chemical products generally were higher in 2004 but this did not have a significant effect on occidentals earnings and cash flow 

increases in the costs of production partially offset sales price increases but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized price increases 

other noncash charges to income in 2005 include chemical asset writedowns deferred compensation stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals other noncash charges in 2004 include deferred compensation stock incentive plan amortization environmental remediation accruals and a chemical asset writedown other noncash charges in 2003 include deferred compensation stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals 

 

  

the 2005 amount includes the cash payments for several permian basin acquisitions the acquisition of the vulcan chloralkali manufacturing facilities and the payments to reenter libya and to assume operations of the mukhaizna field in oman these were partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of the premcorvalero shares and the lyondell shares 

the 2004 amount includes the purchase of a pipeline and gathering system in the permian basin and a 204 million advance to the elk hills power llc ehp equity investment which ehp used to repay a portion of its debt 

 

the 2003 amount includes several permian basin acquisitions totaling 317 million 

also see the capital expenditures section below 

 

  

the 2005 amount includes net debt payments of approximately 900 million 

the 2004 amount includes 466 million paid to redeem the trust preferred securities in january 2004 and 159 million paid to redeem occidentals 65percent senior notes 

the 2003 amount includes net debt repayments of 334 million 

occidental paid common stock dividends of 483 million in 2005 424 million in 2004 and 392 million in 2003 

 

   

occidental’s capital spending estimate for 2006 is approximately 30 billion most of the capital spending will be allocated to oil and gas exploration production and development activities in elk hills the permian basin oman qatar and the dolphin project 

commitments at december 31 2005 for major capital expenditures during 2006 and thereafter were approximately 804 million occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations

ecuador 

in ecuador occidental has a 14percent interest in the ocp oil export pipeline as of december 31 2005 occidental’s net investment and advances to the project totaled 73 million occidental reports this investment in its consolidated statements using the equity method of accounting the project was funded in part by senior project debt the senior project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of shiporpay tariffs of certain upstream producers in ecuador including occidental under their shiporpay commitments occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their respective share of projectspecific risks including operating risk political risk and forcemajeure risk occidental would be required to make an advance tariff payment in the event of prolonged force majeure upstream expropriation events bankruptcy of the pipeline company or its parent company abandonment of the project termination of an investment guarantee agreement with ecuador or certain defaults by occidental this advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt at december 31 2005 occidental’s obligation relating to the pipeline company’s senior project debt totaled 100 million and occidentals obligations relating to performance bonds totaled 14 million occidentals overall obligations will decrease with the reduction of the pipeline company’s senior project debt 

 

leases 

occidental has entered into various operatinglease agreements mainly for railcars power plants manufacturing facilities and office space occidental leases assets when it offers greater operating flexibility lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales see the contractual obligations table below 

 

guarantees 

occidental has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds letters of credit indemnities commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by occidental to third parties mainly to provide assurance that opc andor its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees 

at december 31 2005 the notional amount of the guarantees was approximately 575 million of this amount approximately 475 million relates to occidental’s guarantee of equity investees’ debt and other commitments the debt guarantees and other commitments primarily relate to the dolphin energy equity investment and the investment in the ecuador ocp pipeline which are discussed above the remaining 100 million relates to various indemnities and guarantees provided to third parties 

 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes and crossreferences certain contractual obligations that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets andor disclosed in the accompanying notes 

 

   

l awsuits c laims c ommitments c ontingencies and r elated m atters 

opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a substantial number of lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings these actions seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property damage punitive damages civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief opc and certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar federal state local and foreign environmental laws these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages and civil penalties however occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies with respect to all such lawsuits claims and proceedings including environmental proceedings occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 

since april 2004 oxychem has been served with eight lawsuits filed in nicaragua by approximately 2200 individual plaintiffs these individuals allege that they have sustained several billion dollars of personal injury damages as a result of their alleged exposure to a pesticide oxychem is aware of but has not been served in 20 additional cases in nicaragua which occidental understands make similar allegations oxychem has no assets in nicaragua and in the opinion of management these claims are without merit because among other things oxychem believes that none of the pesticide it manufactured was ever sold or used in nicaragua under the applicable nicaraguan statute defendants are required to pay pretrial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from participating fully in their defense in previous situations involving other defendants nicaraguan courts have proceeded to enter significant judgments against the defendants under that statute oxychem has filed a response to the complaints contesting jurisdiction without posting such pretrial deposit in december 2004 the judge in one of the cases the osorio case ruled the court had jurisdiction over the defendants including oxychem and that the plaintiffs had waived the requirement of the pretrial deposit oxychem has appealed that portion of the ruling relating to the jurisdiction of the nicaraguan courts thereafter the trial court ordered defendants including oxychem to file an answer in order to preserve its jurisdictional defense oxychem elected not to make a substantive appearance in the case in august 2005 the judge in the osorio case entered judgment against several defendants including oxychem for damages totaling approximately 97 million in the opinion of management any judgment rendered under the statute including in the osorio case would be unenforceable in the united states 

in september 2004 occidental received formal notification that petroecuador the state oil company of ecuador was initiating proceedings to determine if occidental had violated either its participation contract for block 15 or the ecuadorian hydrocarbons law and whether the alleged violations constitute grounds for terminating the participation contract block 15 operations represent approximately 7 percent of occidentals 2005 consolidated production 4 percent of its proved consolidated reserves and 2 percent of its total ppe net of accumulated dda in august 2005 petroecuador issued a report recommending that the minister of energy declare the termination of occidental’s participation contract for block 15 the principal allegation stated in the notice and the petroecuador report is an assertion that occidental should have obtained government approval for the farmout agreement entered into in 2000 in november 2005 the minister of energy following the procedure set forth in the ecuadorian hydrocarbons law requested that occidental respond to the allegations against it in february 2006 occidental submitted its response to the minister of energy in which occidental confirmed its belief that it has complied with all material obligations under the participation contract and ecuadorian law and that any termination of the contract based upon the stated allegations would be unfounded and would constitute an unlawful expropriation occidental has been cooperating with the ecuadorian authorities in these proceedings and will continue to strive for an 

 

amicable resolution occidental currently is unable to determine the outcome of these proceedings but if there were to be a negotiated settlement it is probable that the terms would effectively reduce the future profitability of block 15 operations see also offbalancesheet arrangements — ecuador for information about the ocp pipeline 

during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax jurisdictions disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law in may 2005 occidental entered into a closing agreement with the irs resolving certain foreign tax credit issues as part of the irs audit of tax years 19972000 the closing agreement was completed after an extensive irs review of various complex tax issues and negotiations between occidental and the irs as a result of the closing agreement occidental recorded a tax benefit of 619 million in 2005 for the reversal of tax reserves that were previously established for those foreign tax credit issues in addition occidental recorded a tax benefit of 335 million in 2005 due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required as united states corporate returns for tax years 19982000 became closed due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations these tax benefits did not have a significant current cash effect 

occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity drilling services electrical power steam and certain chemical raw materials see note 9 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion see “offbalancesheet arrangements — contractual obligations” for further information 

occidental has certain other commitments under contracts guarantees and joint ventures including purchase commitments for goods and services at marketrelated prices and certain other contingent liabilities see “offbalancesheet arrangements” for further information some of these commitments although not fixed or determinable involve capital expenditures and are part of the 30 billion capital expenditures estimated for 2006 

occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2005 occidental is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for material amounts in connection with these transactions 

it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that opc and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits claims and proceedings audits commitments contingencies and related matters if these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding occidental’s reserves an outcome not currently anticipated it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon occidental’s consolidated financial position or results of operations however after taking into account reserves management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon occidental’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

e nvironmental l iabilities and e xpenditures 

occidental’s operations in the united states are subject to stringent federal state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality foreign operations also are subject to environmental protection laws costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand 

 

environmental remediation 

the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases in many cases the laws apply regardless of fault legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites opc or certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal superfund sites comparable state sites and other domestic and foreign remediation sites including occidental facilities and previously owned sites also opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including in some instances having been named in proceedings under cercla and similar federal state and local environmental laws these proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages and civil penalties 

occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary glenn springs holdings inc which reports its results directly to occidental’s corporate management 

the following table presents occidental’s environmental remediation reserves at december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites 

 

  

the following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years 

  

  

occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next ten or more years occidental believes it is reasonably possible that it will continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and other sites the range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to 420 million beyond the amount accrued 

 

for management’s opinion refer to the lawsuits claims commitments contingencies and related matters section above 

 

cercla and equivalent sites 

at december 31 2005 opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in 128 cercla or state equivalent proceedings as shown below 

   

the eight sites with individual reserves over 10 million in 2005 include a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee two closed landfills in western new york groundwater treatment facilities at four closed chemical plants montague michigan hicksville new york western new york and tacoma washington and replacement of a municipal drinking water treatment plant in western new york 

 

active facilities 

certain subsidiaries of opc are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at 18 active facilities five facilities — a chemical plant in louisiana a phosphorus recovery operation in tennessee a chemical plant in texas a chemical plant in kansas and certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern united states — account for 76 percent of the reserves associated with these facilities 

 

closed or sold facilities 

there are 39 sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of opc that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in which occidental or its subsidiaries are involved four sites account for 63 percent of the reserves associated with this group the four sites are an active refinery in louisiana where occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in pennsylvania a closed oxychem chemical plant in pennsylvania and a water treatment facility at a former oxychem chemical plant in north carolina 

 

environmental costs 

occidental’s costs some of which may include estimates relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations are shown below for each segment 

 

  

operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures relate to longerlived improvements in currently operating facilities remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation although total costs may vary in any one year over the long term segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase 

occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately 79 million for 2006 and 77 million for 2007 

 

f oreign i nvestments 

portions of occidental’s assets outside north america are exposed to political and economic risks occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against those risks at december 31 2005 the carrying value of occidental’s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately 52 billion or approximately 20 percent of occidental’s total assets at that date of such assets approximately 39 billion are located in the middle eastnorth africa approximately 10 billion are located in latin america and substantially all of the remainder are located in the other eastern hemisphere region for the year ended december 31 2005 net sales outside north america totaled 44 billion or approximately 29 percent of total net sales 

 

c ritical a ccounting p olicies and e stimates 

the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the management of occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of occidental’s management there has been no material change to these policies over the past three years the selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

 

oil and gas properties 

occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found at the completion of drilling activities the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found if no proved reserves have been found the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense in some cases a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells occidentals practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a twelvemonth period after drilling is complete occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures annual lease rentals and exploration geological geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred 

proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil natural gas and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs 

several factors could change occidental’s recorded oil and gas reserves occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and an additional share for profit occidental’s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline overall occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices in other contractual arrangements sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to a reduction in the quantity of recorded proved reserves pscs also affect reserves as prices increase occidentals share of proved recorded reserves decreases while a decrease in price causes recorded proved reserves to increase an additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different from those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded occidental’s revisions to proved reserves were negative for 2005 and amounted to less than 2 percent of the total reserves for the year the negative revisions in 2005 were primarily a result of psc price effects in 2004 and 2003 revisions to proved reserves were positive and amounted to less than 2 percent of the total reserves for each year additionally occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 144 generally when prices decline andor reserve estimates change significantly there have been no impairments of reserves over the past three years 

if occidental’s consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above the most significant impact would be on the depreciation and depletion rate for example a 5percent increase in the amount of consolidated oil and gas reserves would change the rate from 613 per barrel to 582 per barrel which would increase pretax income by 61 million annually a 5percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from 613 per barrel to 643 per barrel and would result in a decrease in pretax income of 61 million annually 

dda of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unitofproduction method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves the change in the dda rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial 

a portion of the carrying value of occidental’s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties at december 31 2005 the capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties net of accumulated valuation allowance were 788 million these costs are not currently being depreciated or depleted as exploration and development work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion if the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made the timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties if warranted depends upon the nature timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance 

 

chemical assets 

the most critical accounting policy affecting occidental’s chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its ppe occidentals chemical plants are depreciated using either the unitofproduction or straightline method based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical assets which range from 3 years to 50 years are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests the estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained without these continued expenditures the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical plants include sustained higher or lower product prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition feedstock costs energy prices environmental regulations competition and technological changes over the prior three years the change in the depreciation rate due to changes in estimated useful lives has been immaterial 

occidental performs impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or when management’s plans change with respect to those assets occidental compares the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value the key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition feedstock costs energy costs significantly increased regulation and remaining estimated useful life 

due to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products occidental temporarily idled an edc plant in june 2001 and a chloralkali plant in december 2001 subsequent to the purchase of the vulcan chemical assets occidental reviewed all of its chemical assets and decided to close its least competitive plants and upgrade the remaining operations as a result of this review occidental recorded a 139 million pretax charge for the writeoff of these two previously idled chemical plants and one currently operated plant and a pretax additional charge of 20 million for the writedown of another chemical plant in 2005 

occidentals net ppe for chemicals is approximately 26 billion and its depreciation expense for 2006 is expected to be approximately 240 million if the estimated useful lives of occidental’s chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense for example a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pretax earnings by approximately 21 million per year 

 

environmental liabilities and expenditures 

environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience available technology regulations in effect the timing of remediation and costsharing arrangements the environmental reserves are based on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable the reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets 

many factors could result in changes to occidental’s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss the most significant are 

 

  

additionally other events might occur that could affect occidental’s future remediation costs such as 

 

  

at sites involving multiple parties occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability when other parties are jointly liable the financial viability of the parties the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating occidentals ultimate share of liability based on these factors occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable in an amount that would have a material effect on occidental’s consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations 

most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories 

category 1 cercla or stateequivalent sites wherein occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations 

category 2 oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost and 

category 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation 

in all three of these categories occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities as adjusted by recognition for any nonperforming parties 

in addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures which often take in excess of ten years at cercla sites occidental’s reserves include management’s estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems to the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a sitespecific basis 

if the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings for example if the reserve balance were to decrease by 10 percent occidental would record a pretax gain of 42 million if the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 42 million 

 

other loss contingencies 

occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits claims proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet 

these reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate management’s judgments could change based on new information changes in laws or regulations changes in management’s plans or intentions the outcome of legal proceedings settlements or other factors 

 

s ignificant a ccounting c hanges 

listed below are significant changes in accounting principles 

 

eitf issue no 0413

fin no 47 

in march 2005 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no fin 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” fin 47 specifies the accounting treatment for conditional asset retirement obligations under the provisions of sfas no 143 fin 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations at a certain number of its facilities that are mainly related to plant decommissioning under fin 47 which occidental adopted on december 31 2005 occidental is required to record the fair value of these conditional liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated however occidental believes that there is an indeterminate settlement date for these asset retirement obligations because the range of time over which occidental may settle these obligations is unknown or cannot be estimated therefore occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values 

 

sfas no 123r 

on july 1 2005 occidental early adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r sfas 123r “sharebased payments” under the modified prospective transition method since most of occidental’s existing stockbased compensation was already being recorded in the income statement occidental decided to early adopt sfas 123r so that the remaining awards would be accounted for in a similar manner prior to july 1 2005 occidental applied the accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 intrinsic value accounting method for its stock incentive plans under the modified prospective transition method the fair value recognition provisions apply only to new awards or awards modified after july 1 2005 additionally the fair value of existing unvested awards at the date of adoption is recorded in compensation expense over the remaining requisite service period results from prior periods have not been restated as a result of adopting this statement in the third quarter of 2005 occidental recorded a 3 million aftertax credit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

 

fasb staff position no fsp fas 191 

in april 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fsp fas 191 “accounting for suspended well costs” fsp fas 191 provides new accounting guidance that specifies when successful efforts companies can capitalize exploratory well costs the guidance also requires new disclosures related to these costs fsp fas 191 is effective in the first reporting period beginning after april 4 2005 and will be applied prospectively to existing and new exploratory well costs occidental adopted this statement effective july 1 2005 and there was no material effect on the financial statements upon adoption see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the new disclosures 

 

sfas no 153 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 29 sfas no 153 specifies the criteria required to record a nonmonetary asset exchange using carryover basis sfas no 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after july 1 2005 occidental adopted this statement in the third quarter of 2005 and there was no material effect on the financial statements upon adoption 

 

sfas no 151

fsp fas 1062 

in may 2004 the fasb issued fsp fas 1062 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 which specifies the accounting and disclosure requirements for the prescription drug benefits that are available under this new plan occidental adopted the disclosure provisions of this pronouncement in the second quarter of 2004 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

 

fin 46r revised 

in december 2003 the fasb revised fin 46 to exempt certain entities from its requirements and to clarify certain issues arising during the initial implementation of fin 46 occidental adopted the revised interpretation in the first quarter of 2004 and it did not have a material impact on the financial statements when adopted 

 

sfas no 143 

effective january 1 2003 occidental adopted sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

the initial adoption of sfas no 143 on january 1 2003 resulted in an aftertax charge of 50 million which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles the adoption increased net ppe by 73 million increased asset retirement obligations by 151 million and decreased deferred tax liabilities by 28 million 

 

eitf issue no 023 

in october 2002 occidental adopted certain provisions of eitf issue no 023 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities as a result of adopting eitf issue no 023 there were no changes to gross margins net income cash flow or earnings per share for any period however net sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement 

from 1999 to 2002 occidental accounted for certain energytrading contracts in accordance with eitf issue no 9810 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf issue no 9810 required that all energytrading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses included in earnings whether the contracts were derivatives or not in october 2002 the eitf rescinded eitf issue no 9810 thus precluding marktomarket accounting for all energytrading contracts that are not derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third parties also the rescission requires derivative gains and losses to be presented net on the income statement whether or not they are physically settled if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes occidental adopted this accounting change in the first quarter of 2003 and recorded an 18 million aftertax charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 

d erivative a ctivities and m arket r isk 

 

general 

occidentals market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices and to a lesser extent interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates occidental periodically enters into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price and rate fluctuations a derivative is an instrument that among other characteristics derives its value from changes in another instrument or variable 

in general the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices dealer quotes and the black scholes or similar valuation models 

 

commodity price risk 

general 

occidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices based on current levels of production if oil prices vary overall by 1 per barrel it would have an estimated annual effect on pretax income of approximately 150 million if natural gas prices vary by 025 per mcf it would have an estimated annual effect on pretax income of approximately 42 million if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidental’s results to oil and gas prices also would change 

occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices however changes in cost usually offset part of the effect of price changes on margins if chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by 10ton it would have approximately a 15 million and 30 million respectively pretax annual effect on income if pvc prices vary by 01lb it would have approximately a 25 million pretax annual effect on income if edc prices vary by 10ton it would have approximately a 5 million pretax annual effect on income historically price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock price changes therefore the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated according to chemical market associates inc december 2005 average contract prices were chlorine—358ton caustic soda—455ton pvc—0645lb and edc—250ton 

 

marketing and trading operations 

occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas derivatives are also used by occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in commodityrelated cash flows occidental enters into lowrisk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization which operates under established policy controls and procedures with respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations occidental utilizes a combination of futures forwards options and swaps to offset various physical transactions occidentals use of derivatives in marketing and trading activities relates primarily to managing cash flows from thirdparty purchases which includes occidental’s periodic gas storage activities 

 

risk management 

occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities which include buying selling marketing trading and hedging activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy the chief financial officer and the risk management committee comprising members of occidentals management oversee these controls which are implemented and enforced by the trading control officer the trading control officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities controls for energy commodities include limits on credit limits on trading segregation of duties delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls 

 

fair value of marketing and trading derivative contracts 

the following tables reconcile the changes in the net fair value of occidental’s marketing and trading contracts a portion of which are hedges during 2005 and 2004 and segregate the open contracts at december 31 2005 by maturity periods 

 

   

   

production hedges 

during the first quarter of 2005 occidental entered into a series of fixed price swaps and costless collar agreements that qualify as cashflow hedges for the sale of its crude oil production these hedges which began in july 2005 and continue to the end of 2011 hedge less than 4 percent of occidental’s 2005 crude oil production information about these cashflow hedges which are included in the total fair value of 457 million in the table above is presented in a tabular presentation below 

 

  

   

quantitative information 

occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commoditybased derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities this method determines the maximum potential negative shortterm change in fair value with a 95percent level of confidence the marketing and trading value at risk was immaterial during all of 2005 

 

interest rate risk 

general 

occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its longterm debt obligations in 2005 occidental terminated all of its interestrate swaps that were accounted for as fairvalue hedges these hedges had effectively converted approximately 17 billion of fixedrate debt to variablerate debt the fair value of the swaps at termination resulted in a gain of approximately 20 million which is being amortized into income over the remaining life of the previously hedged debt the amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement was lower as a result of the swaps and amortization of the deferred gain by approximately 21 million 56 million and 58 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

occidental was a party to a series of forward interestrate locks which qualified as cashflow hedges the hedges were related to the construction of a cogeneration plant leased by occidental that was completed in december 2002 the unamortized loss on the hedges at december 31 2005 was approximately 19 million aftertax which is recorded in accumulated oci and is being recognized in earnings over the lease term of 26 years on a straightline basis 

certain of occidentals equity investees have entered into additional derivative instruments that qualify as cashflow hedges occidental reflects its proportionate share of these cashflow hedges in oci 

 

tabular presentation of interest rate risk 

in millions of us dollars except rates 

 

the table below provides information about occidentals debt obligations which are sensitive to changes in interest rates debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date 

 

   

credit risk 

occidental’s energy contracts are spread among several counterparties creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits and manages creditenhancement issues credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances current month activity and forward marktomarket exposure and losses associated with credit risk have been immaterial 

 

foreign currency risk 

a few of occidental’s foreign operations have currency risk occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes most international crude oil sales are denominated in us dollars additionally all of occidental’s oil and gas consolidated foreign entities have the us dollar as the functional currency at december 31 2005 and 2004 occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments the effect of exchangerate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income and is immaterial

item 3    legal proceedings
     for information regarding lawsuits claims commitments contingencies and
related matters see the information in note 9 to the consolidated financial
statements
     in september 2004 occidental received formal notification from
petroecuador the state oil company of ecuador initiating proceedings to
determine if occidental had violated its participation contract for block 15 or
the ecuadorian hydrocarbons law and whether the alleged violations constitute
grounds for terminating the participation contract the principal allegation
stated in the notice is an assertion that occidental should have obtained
government approval of a farmout agreement entered into in 2000 occidental
believes that it has complied with all material obligations under the
participation contract and ecuadorian law and that any termination of the
contract based upon the stated allegations would be unfounded and would
constitute an unlawful expropriation occidental is cooperating with ecuadorian
authorities in the current proceedings and will continue to strive for an
amicable resolution block 15 operations represent approximately 9 percent of
occidentals 2004 consolidated production 4 percent of its proved consolidated
reserves and 2 percent of its total property plant and equipment net of
accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization
     in april 2004 a number of us companies including oxychem were served
with seven lawsuits filed in nicaragua by approximately two thousand individual
plaintiffs these individuals allege that they have sustained several billion
dollars of personal injury damages as a result of their alleged exposure to a
pesticide in the opinion of management these claims are without merit because
among other things oxychem believes that none of the pesticide it manufactured
was ever sold or used in nicaragua


                                       6

under the applicable nicaraguan statute defendants are required to pay
pretrial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from
participating fully in their defense in two such situations involving other
defendants nicaraguan courts proceeded to enter significant judgments against
the defendants under that statute oxychem has filed a response to the complaint
contesting jurisdiction without posting such pretrial deposit in december
2004 the judge in one of the cases ruled the court had jurisdiction over the
defendants including oxychem and that the defendants did not have to pay the
pretrial deposit oxychem intends to appeal that portion of the ruling relating
to the jurisdiction of the nicaraguan courts in the opinion of management any
judgment rendered under the statute would be unenforceable in the united states
     accordingly management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of
these matters to have a material adverse effect upon occidentals consolidated
financial position or results of operations

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations mda incorporating item 7a


     in this report the term occidental refers to occidental petroleum
corporation opc andor one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting
interest subsidiaries occidental is divided into two segments oil and gas
and chemical

strategy
general
     occidental aims to generate competitive total returns to stockholders using
the following strategy

   focus on large longlived oil and gas assets with growth potential

   maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet

   manage chemical segment to provide cash in excess of normal capital
     expenditures


     occidental prefers to own large longlived legacy oil and gas assets
like those in california the permian basin and qatar that tend to have
moderate decline rates enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities
and economies of scale that lead to costeffective production management
expects such assets to contribute substantial earnings and cash flow after
invested capital
     at occidental maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in
projects that management expects will generate abovecostofcapital returns
throughout the business cycle during periods of high commodity prices
occidental will use most of its cash flow after capital expenditures and
dividends to improve future earnings by making such investments or through debt
reduction


                                       9
page


     the chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy capital is
expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound
way to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to lower
manufacturing costs asset acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to
enhance the existing core chloralkali and polyvinyl chloride businesses
historically the chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal
capital expenditure requirements occidental intends to invest this cash mainly
in strategically attractive assets or to reduce debt as part of occidentals
strategy to grow its oil and gas business any excess cash generated by the
chemical segment may be used as part of the overall funding for oil and gas
growth

oil and gas
     the oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a
pace well ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for finding and
development among the lowest in the industry the oil and gas business
implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy
primarily by

   continuing to add commercial reserves through a combination of focused
     exploration and development programs conducted in and around occidentals
     core areas which are the us the middle east and latin america

   pursuing commercial opportunities in core areas to enhance the development
     of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil by applying
     appropriate technology and stateoftheart reservoirmanagement practices
     and

   maintaining a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at
     attractive prices

     over the past several years occidental has strengthened its asset base
within each of the core areas occidental has invested in and disposed of
assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its
assets see oil and gas segment  business review for a discussion of these
changes
     occidentals overall performance during the past several years reflects the
successful implementation of its oil and gas business strategy beginning with
the acquisition of the elk hills oil and gas field in california followed by the
purchase of altura energy in the permian basin in west texas and thereafter by
several smaller acquisitions
     at the end of 2004 the elk hills and permian basin assets made up 66
percent of occidentals consolidated proven oil reserves and 45 percent of its
consolidated proven gas reserves on a barrels of oil equivalent boe basis
they accounted for 62 percent of occidentals consolidated reserves in 2004
the combined production from these assets averaged approximately 265000 boe per
day which represents approximately 47 percent of occidentals total worldwide
production these assets also contributed approximately 58 percent of oil and
gas segment earnings


chemical
     oxychems strategy is to be a lowcost producer so that it can maximize its
cash flow generation oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain where it
begins with chlorine which is coproduced with caustic soda and then converts
chlorine and ethylene through a series of intermediate products into pvc
oxychems focus on chlorovinyls permits it to take advantage of economies of
scale

key performance indicators
general
     occidental seeks to ensure that it meets its strategic goals by
continuously measuring its success in maintaining below average debt levels and
top quartile performance compared to its peers in

   overall return on equity

   overall return on capital employed and

   other segment specific measurements such as profit per unit produced cost
     to produce each unit cash flow per unit cost to find and develop new
     reserves and other similar measures

     occidentals total debt and total debttocapitalization ratios are shown

oil and gas segment
business environment
     oil and gas prices are the key variables that drive the industrys
financial performance prices can vary significantly even on a shortterm
basis oil prices continued to strengthen in 2004 over their levels in the
previous year during the year occidental experienced an increase in its price
differential between the average west texas intermediate wti price and
occidentals realized prices occidentals realized crude oil price was 3911
per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to 3787 per barrel in the
third quarter of 2004 during this same period wti prices increased 441 per
barrel the change in the differential between the average price of wti and
occidentals realized price was primarily due to a significant increase in the
volume of sour crude oil in global markets approximately 70 percent of
occidentals crude oil could be classified as sour this change in the
historical pattern of differentials makes forecasting realized prices difficult
the average wti market price for 2004 was 4140 per barrel compared with 3103
per barrel in 2003 occidentals average realized price for oil in 2004 was
3509 compared with 2725 in 2003

business review
     all production and reserve figures are net to occidental unless otherwise
specified

elk hills
     occidental operates the elk hills oil and gas field in the southern portion
of californias san joaquin valley with an approximate 78percent interest the
field was acquired in 1998 for 35 billion and is the largest producer of gas
in california oil and gas production in 2004 was approximately 90000 boe per
day since its acquisition total elk hills oil and gas production has been
approximately 235 million boe at the end of 2004 the property still had an
estimated 462 million boe of proved reserves compared to the 425 million boe
that were recorded at the time of the acquisition
     total gas production averaged 228 million cubic feet mmcf per day in 2004
compared to 246 mmcf per day in 2003

permian basin
     the permian basin extends throughout southwest texas and southeast new
mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united
states with the entire basin accounting for approximately 15 percent of total
us oil production occidental is the largest producer in the permian basin
with an approximately 14 percent net share of the total permian basin oil
production occidental also produces and processes natural gas and natural gas
liquids ngl in the permian basin
     most of occidentals permian basin interests were obtained through the
acquisition of altura in 2000 which was valued at approximately 36 billion
     on january 31 2004 occidental acquired a 1300mile oil gathering and
pipeline system in the permian basin that includes storage facilities at a
marketing hub in midland this system allows occidental to efficiently transport
its production to these storage facilities the pipeline is also used to
transport production for third party producers
     occidentals total share of permian basin oil gas and ngl production
averaged 175000 boe per day in 2004 compared to 171000 boe per day in 2003 at
the end of 2004 occidentals permian basin properties had 1083 million boe in
proved reserves occidentals permian basin production is diversified across a
large number of producing areas the largest producing areas include wasson san
andres slaughter levelland north cowden and wasson clearfork which
contributed 21 percent 11 percent 6 percent 6 percent and 5 percent
respectively to 2004 permian boe production
     approximately 45 percent of occidentals permian basin production is from
fields that employ the application of carbon dioxide co2 flood technology an
enhanced oil recovery technique this involves injecting co2 into oil reservoirs
where it acts as a solvent causing the oil to flow more freely into producing
wells the size of these co2 flood operations makes occidental a world leader in
the application of this technology

thums
     occidental purchased thums the field contractor for an oil production unit
offshore long beach california in 2000 occidentals share of production from
thums is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a productionsharing
contract psc whereby occidentals share of production varies inversely with
oil prices for 2004 production from thums averaged 20000 barrels per day

gulf of mexico
     occidental has a onethird interest in the deepwater horn mountain oil
field which is occidentals only asset in the gulf of mexico bp plc bp is
the operator
     the field which began production in november 2002 reached platform
capacity in the third quarter of 2003 for 2004 occidentals production at horn
mountain averaged 22000 boe per day in the second half of 2004 the horn
mountain field was shut down for about 46 days due to hurricane ivan at
yearend 2004 production at the field again reached its capacity

hugoton
     occidental owns a large concentration of gas reserves production interests
and royalty interests in the hugoton area of kansas and oklahoma the hugoton
field is the largest natural gas field discovered in north america occidentals
hugoton operations produced 127000 mcf of natural gas per day and 3000 barrels
of oil per day in 2004

middle east
dolphin project
     occidentals interest in the dolphin project which was acquired in 2002
consists of two separate economic interests held through two separate legal
entities one entity oxy dolphin ep llc owns a 245percent undivided
interest in the assets and liabilities associated with a development and
production sharing agreement dpsa with the government of qatar to develop and
produce natural gas and condensate in qatars north field for 25 years from the
start of production with a provision to request a 5year extension the
purchase price of the undivided working interest in the dpsa was approximately
60 million and was recorded in property plant  equipment this undivided
interest will be proportionately consolidated in occidentals financial
statements
     a second entity oxy dolphin pipeline llc owns 245 percent of the stock
of dolphin energy limited dolphin energy dolphin energy owns the rights to
build own and operate a 260milelong 48inch natural gas pipeline which will
transport dry natural gas from qatar to the united arab emirates uae for the
life of the dolphin project or longer initially the dolphin project will
export 2 billion cubic feet bcf per day of natural gas plus associated
liquids and byproducts however the pipeline is expected to have capacity to
transport up to 32 bcf of natural gas per day and dolphin energy is pursuing
additional business opportunities to meet the growing demand for natural gas in
the uae and oman the purchase price of dolphin energy stock totaled
approximately 250 million and was recorded as an equity investment
     several important milestones have been reached since occidental joined the
dolphin project in 2002 two development wells were drilled and tested
providing sufficient information to complete the field development plan in
october 2003 dolphin energy signed two 25year contracts to supply
approximately one bcf of natural gas per day to two entities in the uae as
stated above demand for natural gas is growing in the uae and oman and a third
supply contract with the emirate of dubai is currently being negotiated in
december 2003 the government of qatar approved the final field development plan
for the dolphin project
     in january 2004 dolphin energy was awarded engineering procurement and
construction epc contracts for the gas processing and compression plant at ras
laffan in qatar as well as for two offshore gas production platforms dolphin
energy is operator on behalf of the contractors under the dpsa the remaining
major epc contracts were also awarded during 2004 to date occidental has
recorded 157 million boe of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the
dolphin project dpsa activity
     the ras laffan plant will receive wet gas from dolphins facilities in
qatars north field and will remove hydrocarbon liquids including condensate
and natural gas liquids for further processing and sale in the global market
the resulting dry gas will be compressed and transported to the uae through
dolphin energys pipeline the projected startup date for production is in late
2006
     the dolphin project is expected to cost approximately 40 billion in
total occidental expects to invest approximately 1 billion of this total the
project will be financed by a combination of participant investment and project
financing during 2005 occidental expects to spend a combined total of
approximately 540 million for the gas exploration and development activity and
the investment in dolphin energy compared to 153 million in 2004
     no revenue or production costs were recorded in 2004 for the dolphin
project gas exploration and development activity

qatar
     occidental participates in two production projects in qatar idd el shargi
south dome issd and idd el shargi north dome isnd occidental is engaged in
phase ii of full field development of isnd and is in the process of developing
the issd field issd is a satellite to the isnd field thereby reducing the
overall capital requirement of the two projects
     occidental expects to increase production and recoverable reserves with the
second phase of development under its existing agreement in the isnd field this
new phase is targeting the development and recovery of additional reserves by
applying advanced drilling systems and improved reservoir characterization
techniques capital expenditures in qatar for the issd and isnd projects were
450 million in 2004 and are expected to be approximately 400 million in 2005
     combined production from the two fields averaged 45000 barrels per day in
2004
     also see the dolphin project discussed above

yemen
     in yemen occidental owns directworking interests in the masila field in
block 14 38 percent and a 404percent interest in the east shabwa field
comprising a 286percent directworking interest and an 118percent equity
interest in an unconsolidated entity occidentals production averaged 33000
barrels of oil per day in 2004 with 29000 coming from the masila field and the
remainder from east shabwa
     in addition occidental operates block 20 where it owns an 80percent
working interest occidental drilled two exploratory wells in block 20 in 2004

oman
     occidentals oman business is centered in block 9 where it is the operator
and holds a 65percent working interest under the block 9 psc occidentals
share of production averaged 13000 barrels of oil per day in 2004
     in march 2004 occidental began selling gas to the government of oman under
a gas sales agreement thereby allowing occidental to produce previously
stranded gas and condensates from block 9 under the agreement occidental and
its block 9 partner must supply approximately 114 mmcf per day of natural gas
until december 31 2007 thereafter occidental will nominate quantities that it
has available for delivery since march 2004 occidental and its partner
supplied an average of approximately 110 mmcf per day of


                                       12
page


natural gas to the government under the gas sales agreement including gas
delivered during a commissioning period and prior to occidentals obligation to
deliver gas
     the minimum gross quantities to be delivered under the gas sales agreement
through december 31 2007 represent approximately 60 percent of the expected
average gross production of gas from block 9 during that period as of december
31 2004 the gross proved gas reserves from block 9 are approximately 270
percent of the total minimum of gas that remains to be delivered under the gas
sales agreement
     occidental also holds a 65percent working interest in block 27 which is
adjacent to block 9 as operator occidental is conducting an active exploration
program in block 27

libya
     occidental suspended all activities in libya in 1986 as a result of
economic sanctions imposed by the us government but continues to hold an
interest in the assets that it formerly operated since the imposition of
sanctions occidental has derived no economic benefit from its libyan interests
and has no libyan assets on its balance sheet in 2004 the us government
lifted all of the principal economic sanctions against libya as a result
occidental began actively negotiating with the libyan government for
occidentals return to its historical assets in libya those negotiations are
continuing
     separately in january 2005 occidental participated in the epsa iv
exploration bid round in libya occidental was the successful bidder on nine of
the 15 areas available occidental will operate five onshore areas and will have
a 90percent exploration working interest in addition occidental will have a
35percent exploration working interest in four offshore areas the offshore
areas will be operated by woodside petroleum ltd

other eastern hemisphere
pakistan
     occidental holds oil and gas working interests that vary from 25 to 50
percent in four badin blocks in pakistan bp is the operator occidentals
share of production was approximately 20000 boe per day in 2004

russia
     in russia occidental owns 50 percent of a joint venture company
vanyoganneft that operates in the western siberian oil basin production for
2004 was approximately 29000 boe per day

latin america
colombia
     in april 2004 occidental extended the term of its contract with the
government of colombia for the cano limon field the contract was extended to
the economic life of the field occidental has a 35percent net share of
production and is the operator of the field colombias national oil company
ecopetrol operates the cano limoncovenas oil pipeline and marineexport
terminal the pipeline transports oil produced from the cano limon field for
export to international markets in addition occidental also has various
working interests in four exploration blocks
     occidentals share of 2004 production averaged 33000 barrels of oil per
day

ecuador
     occidental operates block 15 in ecuador and has a 60percent economic
interest therein although occidental holds legal title to 100 percent of the
block 15 participation contract it has farmed out 40 percent of its economic
interest related to block 15 occidentals share of production averaged
approximately 46000 barrels of oil per day in 2004 in addition occidental has
a 14percent interest in the oleoducto de crudos pesados ltd ocp oil export
pipeline see offbalancesheet arrangements for further information about the
ocp pipeline
     full development of the edenyuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of
block 15 continued in 2004 additional development wells drilled in the western
portion of the block resulted in an increase in production of approximately
21000 barrels from the 25000 barrels per day produced in 2003
     after completing extensive 3d seismic surveys occidental continues to
expand its exploration activities in block 15
     foreign oil companies including occidental have been paying a value added
tax vat generally calculated on the basis of 10 to 12 percent of expenditures
for goods and services used in the production of oil for export until 2001 oil
companies like other companies producing products for export filed for and
received reimbursement of vat in 2001 the ecuador tax authority announced that
the oil companies vat payments did not qualify for reimbursement in 2002
occidental initiated an international arbitration proceeding against the
ecuadorian government under the united statesecuador bilateral investment
treaty based on occidentals belief that the ecuadorian government is
arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refund the vat to occidental in
july 2004 a tribunal of international arbitrators awarded occidental
compensation for vat refunds from occidentals block 15 operations that were
withheld by the ecuadorian government and indicated that similar vat refunds
should be paid going forward the ecuadorian government has appealed the
tribunals decision and the appeals proceedings continue at present in the
event of an unfavorable outcome the potential effect on occidentals financial
statements would not be material
     in september 2004 occidental received formal notification that
petroecuador the state oil company of ecuador was initiating proceedings to
determine if occidental had violated its participation contract for block 15 or
the ecuadorian hydrocarbons law and whether the alleged violations constitute
grounds for terminating the participation contract the principal allegation
stated in the notice is an assertion that occidental should have obtained
government approval of a farmout agreement entered into in 2000 occidental
believes that it has complied with all material obligations under the
participation contract and ecuadorian law


                                       13
page


and that any termination of the contract based upon the stated allegations would
be unfounded and would constitute an unlawful expropriation occidental is
cooperating with the ecuadorian authorities in the current proceedings and will
continue to strive for an amicable resolution block 15 operations represent
approximately 9 percent of occidentals 2004 consolidated production 4 percent
of its proved consolidated reserves and 2 percent of its total property plant
and equipment net of accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization

productionsharing contracts
     occidental conducts its operations in qatar oman and yemen under pscs and
under such contracts receives a share of production to recover its costs and an
additional share for profit in addition occidentals share of production from
thums is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc occidentals
share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and
increases when oil prices decline overall occidentals net economic benefit
from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices

proved reserves  evaluation and review process
     a senior corporate officer of occidental is responsible for the internal
audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data in addition a corporate
reserves review committee the reserves committee has been established
consisting of senior corporate officers to monitor and review occidentals oil
and gas reserves the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of
occidentals board of directors periodically throughout the year occidental has
retained ryder scott company lp ryder scott independent petroleum
engineering consultants to review its oil and gas estimation processes
     ryder scott has compared occidentals methods and procedures for estimating
oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry standards and has reviewed
certain data methods and procedures used in estimating reserves volumes the
reserve and economic evaluations and reserves classifications ryder scott then
reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection
of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of occidentals
total reserves portfolio
     based on this review including the data technical processes and
interpretations presented by occidental ryder scott has concluded that the
methodologies used by occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally
comply with current securities and exchange commission sec standards ryder
scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes
presented by occidental

proved reserve additions
     occidental consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at yearend 2004
of 2489 million boe as compared with the yearend 2003 amount of 2421 million
boe additionally occidental owns investments in other interests which had
proved reserves of 43 million and 50 million boe at yearend 2004 and 2003
respectively the increase in the consolidated subsidiaries reserves from all
sources was 266 million boe of which 212 million boe were from proved developed
reserves and 54 million boe were from proved undeveloped reserves

     proved developed reserves represent approximately 78 percent of
occidentals total proved reserves

    proved reserves are 80 percent crude oil and condensate and 20 percent
natural gas

revisions of previous estimates
     in 2004 occidental added reserves from revisions of previous estimates of
45 million boe 38 million of which are in the middle east the dolphin project
added 49 million boe these were partially offset by 11 million boe of negative
revisions in qatar yemen and oman due primarily to the impact of higher oil
prices reducing occidentals share of reserves under pscs if oil prices
increase by 5 per barrel less oil volume is required to recover costs and
pscs would reduce occidentals share of proved reserves by approximately 22
million boe oil price increases would also tend to extend the economic lives
for proved reserves from other contracts which would partially offset these psc
reserve volume changes conversely if oil prices drop by 5 per barrel
occidentals share of proved reserves would increase by a similar amount the
economic lives of other reserves would be shorter and this would partially
offset the psc reserve volume changes apart from the effects of product prices
occidentals approach to interpreting technical data regarding oil and gas
reserves makes it more likely future reserve revisions will be positive rather
than negative occidental expects future revisions to be positive as they have
been for the last several years

improved recovery
     in 2004 occidental added reserves of 120 million boe through improved
recovery mainly in the permian basin elk hills field and thums in the united
states and also in qatar in an effort to partially mitigate the decline in oil
and gas production from the elk hills field from the acquisition in 1998
through yearend 2004 occidental has successfully implemented an infill
drilling program the elk hills field employs both gas flood and water flood
techniques in the permian basin the increased reserves were primarily
attributable to enhanced recovery techniques such as drilling additional co2
flood and water flood wells in qatar occidental is currently in the second
phase of


                                       14
page


development under its existing agreement for the isnd field this phase targets
the development and recovery of additional reserves by applying advance drilling
systems and improved reservoir characterization techniques

extensions and discoveries
     occidental obtains reserve additions from extensions which are dependent on
successful exploitation programs in 2004 occidental added reserves of 61
million boe with 39 million boe in the united states and 18 million boe in
ecuador in the rocky mountain area occidental added approximately 24 million
boe from the extension of gas reserves to proved locations most of which will
require additional development capital in ecuador occidental continued full
development of the edenyuturi oil field in block 15

     the success of improved recovery extension and discovery projects depends
on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements as well as oil and gas
prices capital costs and operating costs many of these factors are outside of
managements control and will affect whether or not these historical sources of
reserve additions continue at similar levels

purchases of proved reserves
     in 2004 occidental purchased reserves of 40 million boe of which 29
million boe are in latin america and the remainder in the united states in
april 2004 occidental extended the term of its contract with the government of
colombia to the economic life of the cano limon field of the 29 million boe of
reserve additions occidental owns 25 million boe and a minority shareholder
holds interests in the remaining 4 million boe see the oil and gas segment 
business review  latin america  colombia section above for a more complete
description of this transaction the reserve additions of 11 million boe in the
united states were from various small acquisitions primarily in the permian
basin of which 84 percent were proved developed reserves occidental continues
to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at reasonable
prices acquisitions are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil
and gas contracts at attractive terms as market conditions change the
available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly

proved undeveloped reserves
     in 2004 occidentals proved undeveloped reserves increased by 54 million
boe this net increase resulted from improved recovery extensions and
discoveries primarily in the elk hills field in the permian basin in the
rocky mountain area and in the dolphin project these proved undeveloped
additions were partially offset by reserve transfers to the proved developed
category as a result of 2004 development programs
     the dolphin project dpsa activity was the largest addition to proved
undeveloped reserves in 2004 the government of qatar approved the dolphin
project final field development plan in december 2003 dolphin development
progress including drilling additional wells and constructing platforms lines
a gas plant and gas compression and pipeline facilities will continue through
an expected start up in 2006
     for details of proved reserve activity by geographic areas see the
supplemental oil and gas information unaudited section in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements

industry outlook
     the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant
volatility due to numerous market forces crude oil and natural gas prices are
affected by market fundamentals such as weather inventory levels competing
fuel prices overall demand and the availability of supply
     worldwide oil prices in 2004 remained at or near historical highs
continued economic growth resulting in increased demand and concerns about
supply availability could result in continued high prices a lower demand
growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices
     sustained high oil prices will significantly affect profitability and
returns for occidental and other upstream producers however the industry has
historically experienced wide fluctuations within price cycles although oil
prices cannot be predicted with any certainty the wti price has averaged
approximately 2490 per barrel over the past ten years during 2004 occidental
experienced an increase in its price differential between the average wti price
and occidentals realized prices see the oil and gas segment  business
environment section above for further information
     while supplydemand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic
natural gas prices over the long term daytoday prices may be more volatile in
the futures markets such as on the nymex and other exchanges making it more
difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence over the last ten
years the nymex gas price has averaged 340 per mcf

chemical segment
business environment
     the chemical segment experienced improved results in 2004 due to the
continued improvement in most sectors in which oxychem participates
particularly the building and construction markets the economic recovery
continued its measured growth and the supplydemand for major commodities
tightened product prices were higher but the resulting improvement in
profitability was partially offset by higher costs for raw materials primarily
energy and ethylene
     domestic chlorine demand rose nearly 7 percent compared to 2003 as many
sectors experienced volume growth due to the industrys efforts to improve
profitability by reducing capacity the upturn in demand resulted in
industrywide chloralkali operating rates of 99 percent the highest since
1995

business review
chloralkali
     demand for chloralkali products improved throughout 2004 with combined
chlorine and caustic soda prices rising throughout the second half of the year
as supply and demand remained tight prices increased significantly in the
latter part of the year particularly for caustic soda oxychems chloralkali
operating rate for 2004 was 99 percent approximately matching the industry
operating rate the tight supplydemand supported higher chlorine prices which
improved over 50 percent during 2004 caustic soda volumes rose with higher
demand especially in the alumina and pulp and paper sectors caustic soda
prices were highly volatile in 2004 as the impact of imports early in the year
caused spot realizations to bottomout early in the second quarter as demand
continued to rise with the improvement of the us manufacturing sector prices
rebounded and increased substantially by yearend export pricing for caustic
soda remained steady through september before rising as the worldwide
supplydemand balance tightened exerting upward pressure on pricing
     oxychem maintained its deer park chloralkali production facility in
houston texas and its edc facility in ingleside texas in standby mode these
idle facilities will be reactivated upon strengthening in overall economic
conditions that leads to sustained improved demand and higher margins for
caustic soda
     in december 2004 oxychem permanently idled a circuit which produced
chlorine and caustic soda at its delaware city plant and recorded a pretax
charge of 12 million

vinyls
     strong demand and increasing ethylene costs led to pvc price increases in
2004 both ethylene and natural gas costs increased in 2004 pvc prices
increased 8 percent compared to 2003 these increases were in addition to the
23percent increase in pvc resin prices in 2003 which was driven by rising
feedstock and energy costs
     industrywide total 2004 demand was 6 percent higher compared with 2003
     oxychem operated its pvc facilities at an average operating rate of 94
percent for 2004 equal to the north american industry average

exit of vinyl specialty resins business
     at the end of 2004 occidental decided to exit the vinyl specialty resins
business for strategic and economic reasons this resulted in the immediate
closure of the pottstown pennsylvania manufacturing facility occidental
recorded an aftertax charge of 32 million in 2004 and classified this business
as a discontinued operation

agreement to acquire vulcan assets
     in october 2004 occidental agreed to purchase three chemical manufacturing
facilities from vulcan materials company for 214 million in cash subject to
adjustment for changes in net working capital in addition occidental may
become obligated to make contingent payments based upon the future performance
of these businesses and will assume specified obligations this transaction
which is subject to regulatory approval is expected to close in 2005

disposition of equistar interest and acquisition of lyondell interest
     in august 2002 occidental sold its 295percent share of equistar to
lyondell and purchased a 21percent equity interest in lyondell occidental
entered into these transactions to diversify its petrochemicals interest these
transactions reduced occidentals direct exposure to petrochemicals volatility
yet allowed it to preserve through its lyondell investment an economic upside
of a recovery in the petrochemicals industry in connection with these
transactions occidental wrote down its investment in the equistar partnership
to fair value by recording a 412 million pretax charge as of december 2001
when this transaction closed in the third quarter of 2002 occidental recorded
an aftertax gain of 164 million
     in november 2004 lyondell acquired millennium chemicals inc millennium
by issuing additional shares of lyondell common stock under sec staff
accounting bulletin no 51 occidental is required to record its share of the
increase in lyondells net equity resulting from this issuance the effect of
this is an increase of 121 million in the carrying value of occidentals
investment in lyondell and an increase in occidentals net income of 77 million
aftertax at december 31 2004 occidental owned 413 million shares of
lyondell common stock with a carrying value of 603 million and a fairmarket
value of 12 billion as a result of the stock issuance occidentals ownership
percentage of lyondell has decreased from approximately 22 percent to 17

     in the fourth quarter of 2002 occidental sold its chrome business at
castle hayne north carolina for 25 million and its plastic calendering
operations in rio de janeiro brazil for a 6 million note receivable in the
third quarter of 2002 occidental recorded an aftertax impairment charge of 69
million and classified both of these businesses as discontinued operations

industry outlook
     occidentals chemical business improved its profitability in 2004 nearly
doubling 2003s earnings levels the major factors that contributed to this
improved performance are the improved us economy and higher demand for major
chemical products
     if operating rates remain at their yearend 2004 levels and the us
economy continues to improve the chemical industry may experience modest price
increases in 2005 improved profitability will depend on the amount of increase
in future energy and feedstock costs
     construction of lng terminals on the us gulf coast could stabilize
natural gas prices at a lowerthancurrent level and thereby help improve the
competitive position of efficient gulf coast chemical facilities however this
construction may not occur in the immediate future

     occidentals chemical business is profitable and is expected to remain
profitable if the current favorable economic conditions continue if however
us manufacturing becomes noncompetitive on a worldwide basis this could
shorten the estimated productive lives of some of occidentals plants resulting
in higher annual depreciation significantly shorter productive lives could also
result in asset impairments including plant closures it is unlikely that any
changes in estimated productive lives would be uniform while potential
impairment charges could have a material impact on the earnings in a discrete
period such changes are unlikely to have a material effect on occidentals
overall financial situation
     for additional discussion of the possible financial effect of a change to
the productive lives of oxychems assets please see the critical accounting
policies and estimates section below

chloralkali
     industry operating rates are near historical highs demand growth is
expected to remain moderate which will put additional strains on manufacturing
capacity due to the high volatility of caustic soda prices in 2004 the 2004
average price was essentially unchanged from 2003 however the caustic soda
markets tightened in the last half of 2004 which may result in increased prices
in 2005 versus 2004

vinyls
     consensus forecasts for 2005 gross domestic product gdp growth of 36
percent suggest expectations for a strong economy that will favorably affect the
vinyls business overall oxychem expects 2 to 3 percent growth in vinyls demand
in north america in 2005 industrywide pvc and vcm operating rates are expected
to be slightly lower in 2005 as a result of the restart of some idled capacity
     chlorovinyls supply constraints together with high ethylene costs have
created conditions for vinyls price increases early in 2005 pvc resin producers
have announced a 2centsperpound increase for january 2005 despite the
restart of some idled capacity vcm supply is expected to be tight due to
maintenance requirements and higher global demand for pvc average operating
rates for north american vcm producers are expected to exceed 93 percent

     individually discussed in this report

     core earnings in 2004 were 35 billion compared with 27 billion in 2003
the increase in core earnings is primarily due to the effect of higher worldwide
crude oil and natural gas prices of approximately 12 billion and higher crude
oil volumes partially offset by higher operating expenses higher exploration
expense and increased dda rates
     core earnings in 2003 were 27 billion compared with 17 billion in 2002
the increase in core earnings primarily reflects the effect of higher crude oil
and natural gas prices and higher crude oil volumes partially offset by lower
natural gas volumes higher dda rates and increased costs
     average consolidated production costs for 2004 were 695 per boe compared
to the average 2003 production cost of 591 per boe
     occidental expects first quarter 2005 production to be slightly higher than
fourth quarter 2004 production assuming oil prices remain in a 40 per barrel
range high oil prices affect the volumes for occidentals pscs in oman qatar
and yemen and the productionsharing type contract at thums in this current
product price range a 100 change in the per barrel price of oil changes

     core earnings were 220 million in 2003 compared with 140 million in
2002 the increase in core earnings reflects the impact of higher prices for all
major products pvc edc chlorine and caustic partially offset by higher

     occidental expects first quarter 2005 chemical earnings to be slightly
higher than the fourth quarter 2004 assuming industry conditions remain at
yearend 2004 levels with current ethylene and energy prices and continued
strengthening of caustic soda margin realizations

significant items affecting earnings
     occidentals results of operations often include the effects of significant
transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in
nature timing and amount therefore management uses a measure called core
earnings which excludes those items this nongaap measure is not meant to
disassociate those items from managements performance but rather is meant to

     taxes


     occidentals 2004 worldwide effective tax rate was 40 percent for reported
income and 41 percent for core income the lower us income tax rate in 2004
compared to 2003 resulted from the crediting of foreign income taxes

income an annual tax election permits a taxpayer to claim either a credit or a
deduction for foreign income taxes whichever is more beneficial occidental
expects to continue its election to credit foreign income taxes in future years
the increase in the federal and state tax rate in 2003 compared to 2002 is due
to a 406 million tax benefit in 2002 related to the gain on sale of the
equistar investment

interests in its outstanding receivables balance which had the effect of
increasing receivables by 360 million compared to december 31 2003 the

cash flow analysis


in millions                              2004        2003        2002

     the significant increase in operating cash flow in 2004 compared to 2003
resulted from several factors the most important drivers were the significantly
higher oil and natural gas prices and to a much lesser extent chemical prices
although the changes in realized prices varied among the regions in which
occidental operates in 2004 occidentals realized oil prices were higher
overall by 29 percent occidentals realized natural gas price increased over 11
percent in the us where approximately 80 percent of occidentals natural gas
was produced in 2004 oil and gas worldwide production on a boe basis
increased for 2004 overall by over 3 percent on a daily basis as compared with
2003 which also contributed to increased cash flow crude oil production was
higher in latin america while natural gas production was higher in the middle
east and lower in the us for 2004
     increases in sales prices realized for occidentals major chemical product
lines ranged from zero to 34 percent compared to 2003 chemical prices
increased in 2004 at a higher rate than the energydriven increase in feedstock
and power costs thereby improving profits and cash flow the overall impact of
the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price
changes not only because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are
significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment but also because
of increases in energy pricedriven feedstock and electric power costs which
are major elements of manufacturing cost for the chemical segments products
sales volumes for chemical products generally were higher in 2004 but this did
not have a significant effect on occidentals earnings and cash flow
     increases in the costs of producing oil and gas such as purchased goods
and services particularly materials and oil field services partially offset
oil and gas sales price increases but such cost increases had a much lower
effect on cash flow than the realized price increases other cost elements such
as labor costs and overheads are not significant drivers of cash flow because
they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term
     the significant increase in operating cash flow in 2003 compared to 2002
resulted from the significantly higher oil and gas prices and to a much lesser
extent chemical prices in 2003 occidentals realized oil prices were higher
overall by 19 percent and realized natural gas prices overall were up 58
percent oil and gas worldwide production on a boe basis increased for 2003
overall by approximately 6 percent on a daily basis as compared with 2002
which also contributed to increased cash flow crude oil production was higher
overall in the us and latin america while natural gas production was lower in
the us for 2003

     sales prices realized for occidentals major chemical product lines ranged
from 15 percent to 70 percent higher in 2003 compared to 2002 chemical prices
in 2003 also improved at a higher rate than feedstock and power costs increases
thus improving profits and cash flow the overall effect of chemical price
changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes sales
volumes for chemical products generally were lower in 2003 but this did not
have a significant effect on occidentals earnings and cash flow
     increases in the costs of production partially offset sales price
increases but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the
realized price increases

     occidentals capital spending estimate for 2005 is approximately 19
billion a majority of the capital spending will be allocated to oil and gas
with the main focus on the dolphin project gas exploration and development
activity qatar elk hills and the permian basin in addition occidental
expects to make a further equity investment of about 200 million in dolphin
energy
     commitments at december 31 2004 for major capital expenditures during
2005 and thereafter were approximately 740 million occidental will fund these
commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations and as needed
with proceeds from existing credit facilities

offbalancesheet arrangements
     in the course of its business activities occidental pursues a number of
projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives the accounting
and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the
varying methods of funding employed occidental also makes commitments on behalf
of unconsolidated entities these transactions or groups of transactions are
recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and unless
otherwise noted are not reflected on occidentals balance sheets the following
is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions

dolphin project
     in july 2004 dolphin energy entered into an agreement with banks to
provide a 136 billion bridge loan for the dolphin project occidental
guaranteed 245 percent of the obligations of dolphin energy under this bank
agreement see oil and gas segment  business review  middle east  dolphin
project and liquidity and capital resources  financing activity for further
information

ecuador
     in ecuador occidental has a 14percent interest in the ocp oil export
pipeline in the second half of 2003 the increased production from the
edenyuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of block 15 coincided with the
completion of the pipeline as of december 31 2004 occidental contributed and
advanced a total of 78 million to the project occidental reports this
investment in its consolidated statements using the equity method of accounting


                                       23

     the project was funded in part by senior project debt the senior project
debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of shiporpay tariffs of certain
upstream producers in ecuador including occidental under their shiporpay
commitments occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their
respective share of projectspecific risks including operating risk political
risk and forcemajeure risk occidental would be required to make an advance
tariff payment in the event of prolonged force majeure upstream expropriation
events bankruptcy of the pipeline company or its parent company abandonment of
the project termination of an investment guarantee agreement with ecuador or
certain defaults by occidental this advance tariff would be used by the
pipeline company to service or prepay project debt at december 31 2004
occidentals obligation relating to the pipeline companys senior project debt
totaled 104 million and occidentals obligations relating to performance bonds
totaled 14 million occidentals overall obligations will decrease with the
reduction of the pipeline companys senior project debt

receivables sale program
     occidental has an agreement in place to sell under a revolving sale
program an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade receivables this
program is used by occidental as a lowcost source of working capital funding
the balance of receivables sold at december 31 2004 and 2003 was zero and 360
million respectively the 2003 amount is not included in the debt and related
trade receivables accounts respectively on occidentals consolidated balance
sheet receivables must meet certain criteria to qualify for the program
     under this program occidental serves as the collection agent with respect
to the receivables sold an interest in new receivables is sold as collections
are made from customers fees and expenses under this program are included in
selling general and administrative and other operating expenses the fair value
of any retained interests in the receivables sold is not material the buyers of
the receivables are protected against significant risk of loss on their purchase
of receivables occidental provides for allowances for any doubtful receivables
based on its periodic evaluation of such receivables the provisions for such
receivables were not material in the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and
2002
     although occidental has not sold any receivables under this program since
june 2004 the program has not been terminated however the program can
terminate upon the occurrence of certain events which generally are under
occidentals control or relate to bankruptcy

leases
     occidental has entered into various operatinglease agreements mainly for
railcars power plants manufacturing facilities and office space the leased
assets are used in occidentals operations where leasing offers advantages of
greater operating flexibility and usually costs less than alternative methods of
funding that were available at the time financing decisions were made lease
payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales see contractual obligation table
below

guarantees
     occidental has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds
letters of credit indemnities commitments and other forms of guarantees
provided by occidental to third parties mainly to provide assurance that opc

     marketing and trading activities where an offsetting sales position exists

lawsuits claims commitments contingencies and related matters
     opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a substantial number
of lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings these actions seek among other
things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property
damage punitive damages civil


                                       24
page


penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief opc and certain
of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the comprehensive
environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar
federal state local and foreign environmental laws these environmental
proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases
compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages and civil penalties
however occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and
has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially
sound companies with respect to all such lawsuits claims and proceedings
including environmental proceedings occidental accrues reserves when it is
probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably
estimated
     during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax
authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax
jurisdictions taxable years prior to 1997 are closed for us federal income
tax purposes taxable years 1997 through 2003 are in various stages of audit by
the internal revenue service disputes arise during the course of such audits as
to facts and matters of law occidental has been in continuing tax audit
settlement discussions with the internal revenue service on issues related to
foreign tax credits and various domestic income issues for the 1997 to 2000
audit years occidental believes that it is reasonably possible that substantive
issues for taxable years 1997 to 2000 could be favorably resolved during 2005
and that such resolutions if they occur could have a positive and material
effect on its results of operations and its financial condition however
occidental believes such resolutions will not have a significant cash effect
     occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to
secure terminal and pipeline capacity drilling services electrical power
steam and certain chemical raw materials see note 9 of the audited financial
statements for further discussion
     occidental has certain other commitments under contracts guarantees and
joint ventures and certain other contingent liabilities many of these
commitments although not fixed or determinable involve capital expenditures
and are part of the 19 billion capital expenditures estimated for 2005
     occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities
that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and
other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these
indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities
that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2004 occidental is not
aware of circumstances that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for
material amounts in connection with these transactions
     it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that
opc and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits claims and
proceedings audits commitments contingencies and related matters if these
matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially
exceeding occidentals reserves an outcome not currently anticipated it is
possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon
occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations however
after taking into account reserves management does not expect the ultimate
resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon
occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations

environmental liabilities and expenditures
     occidentals operations in the united states are subject to stringent
federal state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or
maintaining environmental quality foreign operations also are subject to
environmental protection laws costs associated with environmental compliance
have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future environmental
expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall
business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in
manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand

environmental remediation
     the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply
retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases in many cases the
laws apply regardless of fault legality of the original activities or current
ownership or control of sites opc or certain of its subsidiaries are currently
participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at
federal superfund sites comparable state sites and other domestic and foreign
remediation sites including occidental facilities and previously owned sites
also opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial
number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at
various sites including in some instances having been named in proceedings
under cercla and similar federal state and local environmental laws these
proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases
compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages and civil penalties
     occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly
owned subsidiary glenn springs holdings inc which reports its results
directly to occidentals corporate management

reserves at december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 grouped by three categories of

     occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current
environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next
ten or more years occidental expects that it may continue to incur additional
liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and
other sites the range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental
remediation matters could be up to 375 million beyond the amount accrued

a  includes 27 sites for which maxus energy corporation has retained the
     liability and indemnified occidental 7 sites where occidental has denied
     liability without challenge 54 sites where occidentals reserves are less
     than 50000 each and 13 sites where reserves are between 50000 and 1
     million each

     the seven sites with individual reserves over 10 million in 2004 are a
former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee two closed landfills
in western new york groundwater treatment facilities at three currently closed
or formerly owned chemical plants montague michigan western new york and
tacoma washington and replacement of a municipal drinking water treatment
plant in western new york

active facilities
     certain subsidiaries of opc are currently addressing releases of substances
from past operations at 16 active facilities four facilities  certain oil and
gas properties in the southwestern united states a chemical plant in louisiana
a chemical plant in texas and a phosphorous recovery operation in tennessee 
account for 75 percent of the reserves associated with these facilities


closed or sold facilities
     there are 39 sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of
opc that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in which occidental
or its subsidiaries are involved three sites account for 62 percent of the
reserves associated with this group the three sites are an active refinery in
louisiana where occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for
certain remedial actions a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in
pennsylvania and a former oxychem chemical plant in ohio operated by new
ownership

     operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures
relate to longerlived improvements in currently operating facilities
remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and
do not contribute to current or future revenue generation although total costs
may vary in any one year over the long term segment operating and capital
expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase
     occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental
compliance will be approximately 65 million for 2005 and 80 million for 2006

foreign investments
     portions of occidentals assets outside north america are exposed to
political and economic risks occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to
mitigate its exposure against those risks at december 31 2004 the carrying
value of occidentals assets in countries outside north america aggregated
approximately 41 billion or approximately 19 percent of occidentals total
assets at that date of such assets approximately 29 billion are located in
the middle east approximately 972 million are located in latin america and
substantially all of the remainder are located in pakistan for the year ended
december 31 2004 net sales outside north america totaled 31 billion or
approximately 27 percent of total net sales

critical accounting policies and estimates
     the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap
requires the management of occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding
certain items and transactions it is possible that materially different amounts
could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual
results differ from these estimates and judgments occidental considers the
following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve
the judgment of occidentals management there has been no material change to
these policies over the past three years the selection and development of these
critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit
committee of the board of directors

oil and gas properties
     occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and
gas properties under this method costs of acquiring properties costs of
drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized the
costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of
whether proved reserves have been found at the completion of drilling
activities the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination
is made that proved reserves have been found if no proved reserves have been
found the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to
expense in some cases a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the
completion of drilling requiring additional testing and evaluation of the
wells occidentals practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells
if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a twelvemonth
period after drilling is complete occidental has no oil and gas reserves for
which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of
major additional capital expenditures annual lease rentals exploration costs
geological geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred
     proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil
natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls that geological and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from
known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering
future production and development costs there are several factors that could
change occidentals recorded oil and gas reserves occidental receives a share
of production from pscs to recover its costs and an additional share for profit
occidentals share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices
rise and increases when oil prices decline overall occidentals net economic
benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices in other
contractual arrangements sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation
where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical estimation of future
production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to
factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and inflation or
deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to a
reduction in the quantity of recorded proved reserves pscs also affect
reserves as prices increase occidentals share of proved recorded reserves
decreases while a decrease in price causes recorded proved reserves to increase
see the oil and gas segment  proved reserves additions section above for
further information an additional factor that could result in a change of
proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different from those
assumed when the reserves were initially recorded overall occidentals
revisions to proved reserves were positive for 2004 2003 and 2002 and amounted
to less than 2 percent of the total reserves for each year additionally
occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to sfas no 144
generally when prices decline andor reserve estimates change significantly
there have been no impairments of reserves over the past three years
     depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is
determined by the unitofproduction method and could change with revisions to
estimated proved recoverable reserves the change in the depreciation and
depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve
estimates has been immaterial
     if occidentals consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on
the factors mentioned above the most significant impact would be on the
depreciation and depletion rate for example a 5percent increase in the amount
of consolidated oil and gas reserves would change the rate from 525 per barrel
to 499 per barrel which would increase pretax income by 52 million
annually a 5percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate
from 525 per barrel to 552 per barrel and would result in a decrease in
pretax income of 52 million annually
     a portion of the carrying value of occidentals oil and gas properties is
attributable to unproved properties at december 31 2004 the costs
attributable to unproved properties were approximately 500 million these costs
are not currently being depreciated or depleted as exploration and development
work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven capitalized
costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and
depletion if the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful the
capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be
expensed in the year in which the determination was made the timing of any
writedowns of these unproven properties if warranted depends upon the nature
timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their
results occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow
it to realize the unproved property balance

chemical assets
     the most critical accounting policy affecting occidentals chemical assets
is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its property plant and
equipment occidentals chemical plants are depreciated using either the
unitofproduction or straightline method based upon the estimated useful life
of the facilities the estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical assets
which range from 3 years to 50 years are used to


                                       27
page


compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests the
estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the
assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual
expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained without these continued
expenditures the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease
other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidentals
chemical plants include higher or lower product prices which are particularly
affected by both domestic and foreign competition feedstock costs energy
prices environmental regulations competition and technological changes
     occidental is required to perform impairment tests on its assets whenever
events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful
lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable or when managements plans change with respect to
those assets under the provisions of sfas no 144 occidental must compare the
undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value the key
factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product
prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign
competition feedstock costs energy costs significantly increased regulation
and remaining estimated useful life
     due to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products occidental
temporarily idled an edc plant in june 2001 and a chloralkali plant in december
2001 these idle facilities will be reactivated upon strengthening in overall
economic conditions that leads to sustained improved demand and higher margins
for caustic soda management expects that these plants will become operational
in the future the net book value of these plants was 113 million at december
31 2004 based on yearend value the chloralkali plant that closed on
december 1 2001 has a 24percent minority interest of 22 million these
facilities are periodically tested for impairment and based on the results no
impairment is deemed necessary at this time occidental continues to depreciate
these facilities based on their remaining estimated useful lives
     over the prior three years the change in the depreciation rate due to
changes in estimated useful lives has been immaterial
     occidentals net property plant and equipment for chemicals is
approximately 24 billion and its depreciation expense for 2005 is expected to
be approximately 225 million if the estimated useful lives of occidentals
chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above the most
significant impact would be on depreciation expense for example a reduction in
the remaining useful lives of 20 percent would increase depreciation and reduce
pretax earnings by approximately 55 million per year


environmental liabilities and expenditures
     environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed
or capitalized as appropriate reserves for estimated costs that relate to
existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to
current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial
efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining
the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss occidental refers to
currently available information including relevant past experience available
technology regulations in effect the timing of remediation and costsharing
arrangements the environmental reserves are based on managements estimate of
the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted
as additional or new information becomes available environmental reserves are
recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and
the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing
of cash payments are reliably determinable the reserve methodology for a
specific site is not modified once it has been established recoveries and
reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable for the years
ended december 31 2004 and 2003 occidental has not accrued any reimbursements
or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets
     many factors could result in changes to occidentals environmental reserves
and reasonably possible range of loss the most significant are

   the original cost estimate may have been inaccurate

   modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required
     remediation results occidental generally assumes that the remedial
     objective can be achieved using the most costeffective technology
     reasonably expected to achieve that objective such technologies may
     include air sparging or phytoremediation of shallow groundwater or
     limited surface soil removal or insitu treatment producing acceptable risk
     assessment results should such remedies fail to achieve remedial
     objectives more intensive or costly measures may be required

   the remedial measure might take more or less time than originally
     anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction sitespecific
     time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture
     rates anomalies in subsurface geology interactions between or among
     waterbearing zones and nonwaterbearing zones or the ability to identify
     and control contaminant sources

   the regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify occidentals
     proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action


                                       28
page


     additionally other events might occur that could affect occidentals
future remediation costs such as

   the discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally
     anticipated for some sites with impacted groundwater accurate definition
     of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer
     modeling migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along
     geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected additionally the
     size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk
     assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial
     measures

   improved remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation in
     particular for groundwater remediation sites with projected longterm
     operation and maintenance the development of more effective treatment
     technology or acceptance of alternative and more costeffective treatment
     methodologies such as bioremediation could significantly affect
     remediation costs

   laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent
     remediation requirements

     at sites involving multiple parties occidental provides environmental
reserves based upon its expected share of liability when other parties are
jointly liable the financial viability of the parties the degree of their
commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to
participate are evaluated when estimating occidentals ultimate share of
liability based on these factors occidental believes that it will not be
required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible
parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable in an amount that would
have a material effect on occidentals consolidated financial position
liquidity or results of operations
     most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the
following three categories

     category 1 cercla or stateequivalent sites wherein occidental and other
alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in
accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations

     category 2 oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner
pays its proportionate share of remedial cost and

     category 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and
sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of
allocating the costs of environmental remediation

     in all three of these categories occidental records as a reserve its
expected net cost of remedial activities as adjusted by recognition for any
nonperforming parties
     in addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial
measures which often take in excess of ten years at cercla sites occidentals
reserves include managements estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance
of remedial systems to the extent that the remedial systems are modified over
time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws
regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and
changes the reserves accordingly on a sitespecific basis
     if the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease
based on the factors mentioned above the amount of the increase or decrease
would be immediately recognized in earnings for example if the reserve balance
were to decrease by 10 percent occidental would record a pretax gain of 38
million if the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent occidental would
record an additional remediation expense of 38 million

other loss contingencies
     occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits claims proceedings and
audits in the normal course of its operations occidental records a loss
contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been
impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its
exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these
matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be
incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that
they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet
     these reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to
the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate
managements judgments could change based on new information changes in laws or
regulations changes in managements plans or intentions the outcome of legal
proceedings settlements or other factors

significant accounting changes
     listed below are significant changes in occidentals accounting principles

sfas no 150
     in may 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas
no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity sfas no 150 establishes accounting standards for
how a company classifies and measures financial instruments that have
characteristics of liabilities and equity occidental adopted the provisions of
this statement on july 1 2003 as a result of the adoption occidentals
mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities were classified as a liability
and the payments to the holders of the securities were recorded as interest
expense on january 20 2004 all of the trust preferred securities were
redeemed

fin 46 and fin 46r revised
     in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no fin 46
consolidation of variable interest entities vie fin 46 requires a company
to consolidate a vie if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that
entity even if the company does not have a majority of voting interests a vie
is generally defined as an entity whose equity is unable to finance its
activities or whose owners lack the risks and rewards of ownership the
statement also imposes disclosure requirements for all the vies of a company
even if the


                                       29
page


company is not the primary beneficiary the provisions of this statement apply
at inception for any entity created after january 31 2003 occidental adopted
the provisions of this interpretation for its existing entities on april 1
2003 which resulted in the consolidation of its oxymar investment as a result
of the oxymar consolidation assets increased by 166 million and liabilities
increased by 178 million there was no material effect on net income as a
result of the consolidation in april 2004 marubeni exercised its option to put
its interest in oxymar to occidental by paying approximately 20 million to
occidental
     see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information on
vies where occidental is not the primary beneficiary
     in december 2003 the fasb revised fin 46 to exempt certain entities from
its requirements and to clarify certain issues arising during the initial
implementation of fin 46 occidental adopted the revised interpretation in the
first quarter of 2004 and it did not have a material impact on the financial
statements when adopted

eitf issue no 023
     in the third quarter of 2002 occidental adopted certain provisions of
emerging issues task force eitf issue no 023 issues involved in accounting
for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in
energy trading and risk management activities these provisions prescribed
significant changes in how revenue from energy trading is recorded
historically occidental had two major types of oil and gas revenues 1
revenues from its equity production and 2 revenues from the sale of oil and
gas produced by other companies but purchased and resold by occidental
referred to as revenue from trading activities both types of sales involve
physical deliveries and had been historically recorded on a gross basis in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with the adoption of
eitf issue no 023 occidental now reflects the revenue from trading activities
on a net basis there were no changes in gross margins net income cash flow or
earnings per share for any period as a result of adopting this requirement
however net sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting
amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement for the year ended december
31 2002 net sales and cost of sales were reduced from amounts previously
reported by approximately 22 billion representing amounts for the first two
quarters of 2002 to conform to the current presentation
     from 1999 to 2002 occidental accounted for certain energytrading
contracts in accordance with eitf issue no 9810 accounting for contracts
involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf issue no 9810
required that all energytrading contracts must be marked to fair value with
gains and losses included in earnings whether the contracts were derivatives or
not in october 2002 the eitf rescinded eitf issue no 9810 thus precluding
marktomarket accounting for all energytrading contracts that are not
derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third
parties also the rescission requires derivative gains and losses to be
presented net on the income statement whether or not they are physically
settled if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes occidental
adopted this accounting change in the first quarter of 2003 and recorded an 18
million aftertax charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principles

sfas no 143
     in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset
retirement obligations sfas no 143 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived
assets and the associated asset retirement costs under sfas no 143 companies
are required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if there is a legal
obligation to dismantle the asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the
end of its useful life occidental adopted sfas no 143 in the first quarter of
2003 the initial adoption resulted in an aftertax charge of 50 million which
was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles the
adoption increased net property plant and equipment by 73 million increased
asset retirement obligations by 151 million and decreased deferred tax
liabilities by 28 million the pro forma asset retirement obligation if the
adoption of this statement had occurred on january 1 2002 would have been 131
million at january 1 2002 and 151 million at december 31 2002

sfas no 142
     in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets sfas no 142 changes the accounting and reporting requirements for
acquired goodwill and intangible assets the provisions of this statement are
applied to companies starting with fiscal years beginning after december 15
2001 at december 31 2001 the balance sheet included approximately 108
million of goodwill and intangible assets with annual amortization expense of
approximately 6 million recorded in each of the years income statements for
the threeyear period ended december 31 2001 as a result elimination of
goodwill amortization would not have had a material impact on net income or
earnings per share of any of the years presented and as a result the
transitional disclosures of adjusted net income excluding goodwill amortization
described by sfas no 142 have not been presented upon implementation of sfas
no 142 in the first quarter of 2002 three separate specialty chemical
businesses were identified as separate reporting units and tested for goodwill
impairment all three of these businesses are components of the chemical
segment the fair value of each of the three reporting units was determined
through third party appraisals the appraisals determined fair value to be the
price that the assets could be sold for in a current transaction between willing
parties as a result of the impairment testing occidental recorded a cumulative
aftertax effect of changes in accounting principles reduction in net income of
approximately 95 million due to the impairment of all the goodwill attributed
to these reporting units

derivative activities and market risk
general
     occidentals market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices
and to a lesser extent interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates
occidental periodically enters into derivative instrument transactions to reduce
these price and rate fluctuations a derivative is an instrument that among
other characteristics derives its value from changes in another instrument or
variable
     in general the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on
quoted market prices dealer quotes and the blackscholes or similar valuation
models

commodity price risk
general
     occidentals results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural
gas prices based on current levels of production if oil prices vary overall by
1 per barrel it would have an estimated quarterly effect on income of
approximately 29 million before us income taxes if natural gas prices vary
by 025 per mcf it would have an estimated quarterly effect on income of
approximately 10 million before us income taxes if production levels change
in the future the sensitivity of occidentals results to oil and gas prices
also would change
     occidentals results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices
if chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by 10ton it would have approximately
a 12 million and 25 million respectively annual effect on income before us
income taxes if pvc prices vary by 01lb it would have approximately a 27

marketing and trading operations
     occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to
achieve the best prices for oil and gas derivatives are also used by occidental
to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in
commodityrelated cash flows occidental enters into lowrisk marketing and
trading activities through its separate marketing organization which operates
under established policy controls and procedures with respect to derivatives
used in its oil and gas marketing operations occidental utilizes a combination
of futures forwards options and swaps to offset various physical transactions
occidentals use of derivatives in hedging marketing and trading activities
relates primarily to managing cash flows from thirdparty purchases


risk management
     occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities
which include buying selling marketing trading and hedging activities
under the controls and governance of its risk management policy the chief
financial officer and the risk management committee comprising members of
occidentals management oversee these controls which are implemented and
enforced by the trading control officer the trading control officer provides an
independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities
controls for energy commodities include limits on credit limits on trading
segregation of duties delegation of authority and a number of other policy and
procedural controls

production hedges
     on a limited basis occidental uses cashflow hedges for the sale of crude
oil and natural gas production no cash flow hedges were used for the sale of
production in 2003 and no material amounts were used during 2004 there were no
material crude oil or gas cash flow hedges on future production at december 31
2004 no fair value hedges were used for oil and gas production during 2004 or
2003

quantitative information
     occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes
in fair values of commoditybased derivatives and commodity contracts used in
marketing and trading activities this method determines the maximum potential
negative shortterm change in fair value with a 95percent level of confidence
the marketing and trading value at risk was immaterial during all of 2004


                                       31

interest rate risk
general
     occidentals exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its
longterm debt obligations to reduce its interest rate risk occidental has
entered into several interestrate swaps that effectively convert approximately
17 billion of fixedrate debt to variablerate debt with maturities ranging
from 2006 to 2009

credit risk
     occidentals energy contracts are spread among several counterparties
creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and
on an ongoing basis occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure
relative to credit limits and manages creditenhancement issues credit
exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances current month
activity and forward marktomarket exposure

foreign currency risk
     several of occidentals foreign operations are located in countries whose
currencies generally depreciate against the us dollar typically effective
currency forward markets do not exist for these countries therefore occidental
attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and
liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for
operating purposes most international crude oil sales are denominated in us
dollars additionally all of occidentals oil and gas foreign entities have the
us dollar as the functional currency at december 31 2004 and 2003
occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments the
effect of exchangerate transactions in foreign currencies is included in
periodic income

safe harbor discussion regarding outlook and other forwardlooking data
     portions of this report including items 1 and 2 and the information
appearing under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations including the information under the sub
captions strategy oil and gas segment  industry outlook and chemical
segment  industry outlook contain forwardlooking statements and involve
risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results of
operations liquidity cash flows and business prospects words such as
estimate project predict will anticipate plan intend
believe expect or similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future
events or outcomes generally identify forwardlooking statements occidental
expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any
forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information or otherwise
     factors that could cause results to differ materially from forwardlooking
statements include but are not limited to those listed below

external risks
     volatile global commodity pricing fluctuations beyond occidentals control
strongly affect its revenues profitability operating cash flow and future
growth rate
     as discussed in the section entitled derivative activities and market risk
 commodity price risk  production hedges occidental typically does not
hedge against price fluctuations in either of its businesses with the result
that its financial results correlate closely to the price it obtains for its
products in the global markets in which they compete historically prices for
occidentals products have been volatile in addition a significant portion of
the oil occidental produces is sour crude which has tended to experience lower
rates of price increase because there is comparatively more sour crude oil
available
     drilling and exploration activity levels inventory levels production
disruptions the actions of opec increasing prices or limiting occidentals
production price speculation and geophysical and technical limitations affect
the global shortterm and longterm supply of oil and gas and interact to
contribute to price volatility because of the long lead times associated with
drilling and exploration projects occidental may commit significant amounts of
capital to oil and gas projects and cannot be certain of the level of demand
that will exist when it finishes a project the health of the global economy
alternative sources of energy such as coal and efforts at efficient
consumption can also affect the demand for oil and gas
     demand for occidentals chemicals products correlates most strongly with
the health of the global economy occidental also depends on feedstocks and
energy to produce chemicals both of which are commodities subject to
significant price fluctuations

     occidentals businesses operate in a highly competitive environment
     occidentals future oil and gas production depends on its ability to
acquire or find additional reserves at prices below that at which it can sell
the oil and gas it produces from them after operating costs occidental can
acquire reserves by purchasing existing producing assets or by acquiring
exploration rights and successfully drilling wells that produce hydrocarbons in
commercial quantities industry competition for reserves may cause occidental to
shift toward higher risk exploration activity or force it to pay more for
acquisitions rising exploration and development activity in the industry
generally increases the costs of oil and gas services
     participants in the chemicals industry compete primarily based on price and
the industry consists of many domestic and foreign competitors in addition the
industry has been characterized by sporadic global expansion often leading to
overcapacity whenever currently foreseeable prices appear to support expansion
which has often led to overcapacity
     in both industries occidental uses nonproprietary technology and business
management techniques which limits its ability to achieve significant
comparative production efficiencies

     occidentals businesses may experience catastrophic occurrences
     natural disasters such as hurricanes occur regularly and may occasionally
affect occidentals businesses in addition well blowouts and oilfield fires
armed conflicts civil unrest and industrial accidents may occur and may have an
effect on occidentals businesses occidental maintains insurance against a
number of these risks however it partially selfinsures and insurance may not
always provide the coverage expected or desired due to contractual limitations
unavailability cost of insurance and the insurers financial health

     varied governmental and political actions affect occidentals results of
operations
     the transnational character of occidentals oil and gas business subjects
it to the decisions of many governments and political interests as a result
occidental faces increased risks of change in laws and regulations including
but not limited to those related to taxes royalty rates permitted production
rates import export and use of products and environmental protection as well
as risk of expropriation or reduction of entitlements to produce hydrocarbons
     occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that
occasionally experience political instability which increases occidentals risk
of loss or delayed production associated with armed conflict civil unrest
security problems restrictions on production equipment imports and sanctions
that prevent continued operations occidental may face the risk of increased
costs if it is perceived not to be respecting or advancing the economic and
social progress of the communities in which it operates since occidentals
assets are longlived the magnitude of these risks can vary during the time it
operates in a country

     certain of occidentals major chemicals products are coproduced in a fixed
ratio which limits its ability to exploit pricing opportunities
     because chlorine and caustic soda must be produced together in a fixed
ratio an imbalance in demand between the products ultimately requires
occidental to reduce output or cut prices to restore demand balance either
action in turn limits occidentals profits on these commodities

     technological changes may change the nature of the energy industry
     rising oil and gas prices create incentives to find alternative energy
sources that could replace oil and gas over the long term

internal risks
     occidental may incur significant costs in exploration or development
efforts which may prove unsuccessful or unprofitable
     occidental may misinterpret geologic or engineering data which may result
in significant losses on unsuccessful exploration or development drilling
efforts
     occidental is subject to the risks of project delays and cost overruns due
to unexpected geologic conditions equipment failures and accidents adverse
weather and construction or startup delays and other associated risks

     inadequate cost containment could reduce occidentals competitiveness
     occidental works to minimize the costs associated with its businesses but
the impact of its efforts may not be sufficient to offset any negative effects
related to the main elements of cost which consist of reserve acquisition costs
for oil and gas and feedstock and energy costs for chemicals

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations mda incorporating item 7a

     in this report the term occidental refers to occidental petroleum
corporation opc andor one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting
interest subsidiaries occidental is divided into two segments oil and gas
and chemical

2003 business environment
oil and gas
     oil and gas prices are the key variables that drive the industrys
financial performance prices can vary significantly even on a shortterm
basis oil prices continued to strengthen in 2003 over their levels in the
previous year the average west texas intermediate wti market price for 2003
was 3103barrel bbl compared with 2608bbl in 2002
     nymex domestic natural gas prices increased significantly from 2002 for
2003 nymex gas prices averaged 526mcf compared with 307mcf for 2002


chemical
     the sectors of the chemical industry in which occidental participates
showed signs of improvement in 2003 largely due to the improving economy and the
continued strength of the building and construction markets the industry
experienced higher product prices for all major commodity chemicals however
the margin improvement was largely offset by higher costs for key raw materials
primarily energy and ethylene
     domestic chlorine demand dropped slightly in 2003 compared to 2002 as the
robust housing sector could not overcome general weakness in other manufacturing
markets however chlorine prices increased sharply in 2003 from their depressed
levels in early 2002 in part due to the tightening of supply resulting from
industry capacity reductions and the favorable influence of the strong vinyls
vcmpvc demand mainly in the housing sector caustic soda prices began to
improve in the


                                       8
page


second quarter of 2003 but softened late in the year due to pressure to move
more caustic soda volume versus chlorine however overall caustic soda prices
improved for the year pvc prices improved significantly although the price
improvement was largely offset by higher raw material costs

strategy and overall performance
     occidentals overall corporate strategy aims to generate competitive total
returns to stockholders and consists of three basic elements

   focus on large longlived oil and gas assets with growth potential
   maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet
   harvest cash from chemicals

     large longlived legacy oil and gas assets like those in california
the permian basin in texas and qatar tend to have moderate decline rates
enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale
that lead to costeffective production these assets are expected to contribute
substantial earnings and cash flow after capital
     at occidental maintaining financial discipline means prudently investing
capital in projects that are expected to generate abovecostofcapital returns
throughout the business cycle during periods of high commodity prices
occidental will use the bulk of its cash flow after capital expenditures and
dividends to improve future earnings levels by acquiring additional properties
with lowrisk characteristics or through debt reduction
     the chemicals business generates free cash flow in 2003 free cash flow
for the segment was approximately 290 million which compares favorably with
the 10year annual average the segment was able to achieve this result despite
a difficult year for the chemical industry as a whole for a calculation of
chemical free cash flow see selected cashflow information below
     in order to ensure that its strategic objectives are reached occidentals
management focuses on the following key business goals over the short term

   achieve top quartile performance compared to peer companies in return on
     equity with a below average level of debt
   segments are to achieve top quartile performance compared to peer
     companies in return on assets and other measurements unique to that
     segment these include profits per unit produced costs to produce each
     unit cash flow per unit costs to find and develop new reserves and other
     similar measures

debt structure
     occidentals total debt and total debttocapitalization ratios are shown
in the table below

a  includes trust preferred securities redeemed january 20 2004 natural
     gas delivery commitment which was terminated in 2002 subsidiary
     preferred stock and capital lease obligations


     occidentals yearend 2003 total debttocapitalization ratio has declined
to approximately 37 percent from the 61percent level that existed at the end of
1999 as shown in the table above the decrease in the total
debttocapitalization ratio in 2003 compared to 1999 is the result of total
debt reductions of 16 percent combined with an increase in stockholders equity
of 125 percent over the same period


return on equity


                                      threeyear average

a  the return on equity for 2003 was calculated by dividing occidentals 2003
     earnings applicable to common stock by the average equity balance in 2003
b  the return on equity for the threeyear period was calculated as the sum of
     the annual earnings applicable to common stock for each of the three years
     ended 2003 divided by the sum of the ending equity balances for each year
     end in the same period


     over the past three years occidental has focused on improving its return
on equity in 2003 occidentals return on equity was 214 percent and the
threeyear average return on equity was 185 percent during the same threeyear
period occidentals equity increased by over 41 percent

oil and gas strategy
     the oil and gas business strategy has three parts that together are
focused on adding new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace well ahead of
production while simultaneously keeping finding and development costs among the
lowest in the industry

   continue to add commercial reserves in and around occidentals core areas
     which are the us middle east and latin america through a combination of
     focused exploration and development programs
   pursue commercial opportunities with host governments in core areas to
     enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining
     oil in place by applying appropriate technology and innovative
     reservoirmanagement practices


                                       9
page


   maintain a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive
     prices

     over the past several years the asset base within each of the core areas
has been strengthened occidental has invested in assets with higher performance
potential and sold properties with low or no current return the results of
these changes are discussed below in business review  oil and gas

chemical strategy
     oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with
chlorine which is coproduced with caustic soda and then converts chlorine and
ethylene through a series of intermediate products into pvc oxychem mainly
focuses on being a lowcost producer to maximize its cash flow generation

business review
oil and gas
     occidentals overall performance during the past several years reflects the
successful implementation of its oil and gas business strategy beginning with
the acquisition of the elk hills oil and gas field in california the elk hills
acquisition was followed in april 2000 by the purchase of altura energy in the
permian basin in west texas for 36 billion and thereafter by several smaller
acquisitions during 2003 occidental enhanced its industry leading position in
the permian basin by making several complementary acquisitions
     at the end of 2003 the elk hills and permian basin assets made up 65
percent of occidentals worldwide proven oil reserves and 45 percent of its
proven gas reserves on a boe basis they accounted for 62 percent of
occidentals worldwide reserves in 2003 the combined production from these
assets averaged approximately 265000 boe per day which represents 48 percent
of occidentals total worldwide production these businesses also contributed
approximately 56 percent of oil and gas segment earnings

elk hills
     occidental operates the elk hills oil and gas field in the southern portion
of californias san joaquin valley with an approximate 78percent interest the
field was acquired in 1998 for 35 billion and is the largest producer of gas
in california production in 2003 was approximately 94000 boe per day since
the acquisition date elk hills has generated total net pretax cash flow of
approximately 35 billion after subtracting 871 million of capital
expenditures and has replaced 109 percent of its total elk hills oil and gas
production of 207 million boe at the end of 2003 the property still had an
estimated 444 million boe of proved reserves compared to the 425 million boe
that were recorded at the time of the acquisition
     occidentals california natural gas production is declining as it produces
the elk hills gas cap but the decline has been mitigated by increased
development activities
     total gas production averaged 246 mmcf per day in 2003 compared to 281 mmcf
in 2002

permian basin
     the entire permian basin is the largest oil basin in the lower 48 united
states and accounts for approximately 15 percent of total us oil production
occidental is the largest producer in the permian basin with approximately 15
percent of the total permian production
     occidental integrated its acquisition of altura which was valued at
approximately 36 billion with its previously existing permian basin
properties in southwest texas and southeast new mexico since the acquisition in
2000 the former altura properties have generated approximately 26 billion in
total net pretax cash flow after subtracting capital expenditures of
approximately 565 million
     one element of occidentals strategy in the permian basin is to acquire
producing properties at attractive prices that offer synergies with its existing
operations in 2003 occidental made a number of complementary acquisitions in
the permian basin for a total purchase price of 317 million these acquisitions
increased total proven reserves by 103 million boe for an average cost of 308
per boe
     on january 31 2004 occidental acquired a 1300mile oil gathering and
pipeline system in the permian basin this system will allow occidental to
efficiently gather and transport its production to midland where it has storage
facilities the remainder of the pipelines capacity will be filled by third
party producers
     net permian oil and gas production averaged 171000 boe per day in 2003
compared to 164000 boe per day in 2002
     approximately 50 percent of occidentals permian basin production is
reliant upon the application of carbon dioxide co2 flood technology an
enhanced oil recovery technique this involves injecting co2 into oil reservoirs
where it acts as a solvent causing the oil to flow more freely so it can be
pumped to the surface the size of these co2 flood operations makes occidental a
world leader in the development and application of this technology

thums
     occidental purchased thums the field contractor for an oil production unit
offshore long beach california in 2000 occidentals share of production from
thums is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a productionsharing
contract whereby occidentals share of production varies inversely with oil
prices for 2003 net production from the thums oil property averaged 23000
barrels per day

gulf of mexico
     occidental has a onethird interest in the deepwater horn mountain oil
field which is occidentals only asset in the gulf of mexico bp plc bp is
the operator
     the field began production in november 2002 and production was increased
until it reached platform capacity in the third quarter of 2003 in the fourth
quarter of 2003 occidentals net production at horn mountain averaged 28000
boe per day

hugoton
     occidental owns a large concentration of gas reserves production interests
and royalty interests in the hugoton area of kansas and oklahoma the hugoton
field is the largest natural gas field discovered to date in north america
occidentals hugoton operations produced 138000 mcf of natural gas and 4000
barrels of oil per day in 2003

middle east
dolphin project
     in 2002 occidental purchased a 245percent interest in the dolphin
project for 310 million this investment includes a 245percent interest in
dolphin energy limited dolphin energy the operator of the dolphin project
the dolphin project consists of two parts 1 a development and production
sharing agreement with qatar to develop and produce natural gas and condensate
in qatars north field for 25 years with a provision to request a 5year
extension and 2 the rights for dolphin energy to build own and operate a
260milelong 48inch export pipeline to transport 2 billion cubic feet per day
of dry natural gas from qatar to markets in the united arab emirates uae for
the life of the dolphin project and longer the pipeline will have capacity to
transport up to 32 billion cubic feet per day which will allow for additional
business opportunities
     several important milestones have been reached since occidental joined the
dolphin project in 2002 two development wells were drilled and tested
providing sufficient information to complete the field development plan in
october 2003 dolphin energy signed two 25year contracts to supply
approximately one bcf of natural gas per day to two entities in the uae a third
supply contract with the emirate of dubai is currently being negotiated in
addition other markets for natural gas and hydrocarbon liquids are being
pursued in december 2003 the government of qatar approved the final field
development plan for the dolphin project based on the foregoing developments
occidental recorded 107 million boe of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves
in 2003
     most recently in january 2004 dolphin energy awarded engineering
procurement and construction contracts for the gas processing and compression
plant at ras laffan in qatar as well as for two offshore gas production
platforms the plant will receive wet gas from dolphins facilities in qatars
north field and will remove hydrocarbon liquids including condensate and
natural gas liquids for further processing and sale the resulting dry gas will
be compressed and transported to the uae through dolphin energys pipeline the
projected startup date for production is in 2006
     the dolphin project is expected to cost approximately 40 billion in
total occidental expects to invest approximately 1 billion for its
245percent share in the dolphin project over the next three years a portion
of the project costs may be project financed during 2004 occidental expects to
invest approximately 250 to 300 million which is expected to be provided by
occidentals operating cash flow this investment is in addition to occidentals
expected 2004 capital expenditures of 14 billion that are discussed under
liquidity and capital resources
     as the project has not begun operation no revenue or production costs were
recorded in 2003

qatar
     by introducing advanced drilling systems and applying new waterflooding and
reservoir characterization techniques in the idd el shargi north dome isnd
field occidental has increased production and recoverable reserves from the
field
     occidental is moving forward with a second phase under its existing
agreement in the development of isnd the new phase is targeting the development
and recovery of additional reserves from isnd
     occidental is also engaged in fullfield development of the idd el shargi
south dome issd field which as a satellite to the north dome reduces the
overall capital requirement of the two projects
     combined production from the two fields averaged 45000 barrels per day
net to occidental in 2003
     also see the dolphin project discussed above

yemen
     in yemen occidental owns direct working interests in the masila field in
block 14 38 percent and a 404percent interest in the east shabwa field
comprising a 286percent directworking interest and a 118percent equity
interest in an unconsolidated entity occidentals net production averaged
37000 barrels of oil per day in 2003 with 31000 coming from the masila field
and the remainder from east shabwa

oman
     occidentals oman business is centered in block 9 where it holds a
65percent working interest in the productionsharing contract for this block
     net production to occidental averaged 12000 barrels of oil per day in
2003
     occidental has entered into a gas sales and purchase agreement with the
government of oman to sell approximately 120 million gross cubic feet of natural
gas per day from block 9 operations to the government first gas sales are
anticipated in mid2004 this agreement has opened up a market for previously
stranded gas that is associated with oil production from the safah field
     occidental also continues its exploration program in the adjacent block 27
in 2003 the government of oman approved a farmout of a 35percent working
interest in block 27 to mitsui ep middle east bv mitsui as a result
occidental and mitsui now share the same working interest percentages in both
block 9 and block 27

libya
     occidental suspended all activities in libya in 1986 as a result of
economic sanctions imposed by the us government but continues to hold an
interest in the assets that it formerly operated since the imposition of
sanctions occidental has derived no economic benefit from its libyan interests
and has no libyan assets on its balance sheet over the past two years
occidental representatives have met with libyan officials under specific
authority and guidelines set by the us treasury departments office of foreign
assets control ofac for the purpose of factfinding and discussing generally
the status of its contractual interests and property rights recent developments
that have led to an improvement in uslibya relations have given rise to
speculation that the sanctions could be eased or perhaps lifted in the near
future until that happens occidental will continue complying with the existing
sanctions and its ofac licenses occidental remains very interested in returning
to libya where it had considerable success in finding and developing large
volumes of commercial oil reserves management is carefully monitoring the
dynamics of the evolving uslibya relationship

other eastern hemisphere
pakistan
     occidental holds oil and gas working interests that vary from 25 to 50
percent in four badin blocks in pakistan bp is the operator in 2002
occidental purchased additional interests in two of these blocks from the
government of pakistan for approximately 72 million 2003 gross production was
102000 boe per day while occidentals net share was approximately 22000 boe
per day

russia
     in russia occidental owns 50 percent of a joint venture company
vanyoganneft that operates in the western siberian oil basin production for
2003 was approximately 30000 boe per day net to occidental

latin america
colombia
     occidental has a 35percent net share of production and is the operator of
the cano limon oil field in colombia cumulative gross production from cano
limon reached one billion barrels of oil in 2003 colombias national oil
company ecopetrol operates the cano limoncovenas oil pipeline and
marineexport terminal the pipeline transports oil produced from the cano limon
field for export to international markets in addition occidental has working
interests in three exploration blocks rio aipe 50 percent chipiron 88
percent and cosecha 75 percent
     production in 2003 approximated 2002 levels as improved security along the
export pipeline reduced the number of attacks by local terrorist groups below
the peak levels of 2001 occidentals net share of 2003 production averaged
32000 barrels of oil per day occidentals interests in colombia account for
approximately 1 percent of its worldwide assets 2 percent of its total
worldwide reserves and about 6 percent of its worldwide oil and gas production
in 2003 occidental anticipates that it will recover the proved reserves
attributable to its contract

ecuador
     net production in block 15 which occidental operates with a 60percent
working interest averaged approximately 25000 barrels of oil per day in 2003
     in the second half of 2003 the increased production from the edenyuturi
oil field in the southeastern corner of block 15 coincided with the completion
of the oleoducto de crudos pesados ocp ltd oil export pipeline in which
occidental has a 14percent interest full field development of the edenyuturi
oil field is underway with continued development drilling planned in 2004 in
addition work continues in the producing areas in the western portion of the
block at the indillana complex and the yanaquincha and limoncocha fields these
projects are expected to increase production by 20000 barrels per day for a
total net production of 45000 barrels per day in 2004
     in addition occidental has completed extensive 3d seismic surveys and
plans to continue expanding its exploration activities in block 15 in 2004
     foreign oil companies including occidental have been paying a value added
tax vat generally calculated on the basis of 10 to 12 percent of expenditures
for goods and services used in the production of oil for export until 2001 oil
companies like other companies producing products for export filed for and
received reimbursement of vat in 2001 the ecuador tax authority announced that
the oil companies vat payments did not qualify for reimbursement in response
the affected oil companies filed actions in the ecuador tax court to seek a
judicial determination that the expenditures are subject to reimbursement in
november 2002 occidental initiated an international arbitration proceeding
against the ecuadorian government under the united statesecuador bilateral
investment treaty based on occidentals belief that the ecuadorian government is
arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refund the vat to occidental
arbitration proceedings continue at present occidental believes that it has a
valid claim for reimbursement under applicable ecuador tax law and the treaty
in the event of an unfavorable outcome the potential financial statement effect
would not be significant

productionsharing contracts
     occidental conducts its operations in qatar oman and yemen under
productionsharing contracts and under such contracts receives a share of
production to recover its costs and an additional share for profit occidentals
share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and
increases when oil prices decline overall occidentals net economic benefit
from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices

chemical
chloralkali
     demand for chloralkali products improved throughout the first half of 2003
with combined chlorine and caustic soda prices peaking about midyear however
as supply and demand shifted to a more balanced position prices softened in the
latter part of the year oxychems chloralkali operating rate for 2003 was 90
percent approximately matching the industry domestic caustic soda pricing
improved in the second quarter but then fell to its lowest level of the year in
the fourth quarter export pricing for caustic soda remained weak throughout the
year as the worldwide supply exceeded demand exerting downward pressure on
pricing
     oxychem maintained its deer park chloralkali production facility in
houston texas and its edc facility in ingleside texas in standby mode in june
2003 oxychem idled a circuit which produced chlorine and caustic soda at its
delaware city plant these idle facilities will be reactivated upon
strengthening in overall economic conditions that leads to improved demand and
higher margins for caustic soda

vinyls
     continuing strength in natural gas and ethylene prices pushed costs higher
in pvc and led to price increases of two cents per pound per month for four
consecutive months in early 2003 for a total increase of 22percent these
increases were in addition to the 43percent increase in pvc resin prices in
2002 which was also driven by rising feedstock and energy costs
     total year 2003 demand was lower by 2 percent compared with 2002
     for 2003 ethylene prices rose by over 55 cents per pound and average
natural gas costs were nearly 2 per million british thermal units mmbtu
higher than 2002
     oxychem operated its pvc facilities at an average operating rate of 88
percent for 2003 slightly above the north american industry average operating
rate of 86 percent
     in the fourth quarter of 2003 export markets for both pvc and vcm
strengthened notably helped by vcm outages in the us and overseas

disposition of equistar interest and acquisition of lyondell interest
     in august 2002 occidental sold its 295percent share of equistar to
lyondell and purchased a 21percent equity interest in lyondell occidental
entered into these transactions to diversify its petrochemicals interest these
transactions reduced occidentals direct exposure to the inherent volatility in
the petrochemicals markets yet will allow it to participate through its
lyondell investment in the economic recovery of the petrochemicals industry in
connection with these transactions occidental wrote down its investment in the
equistar partnership to fair value by recording a 412 million pretax charge as
of december 2001 when this transaction closed in the third quarter of 2002
occidental recorded an aftertax gain of 164 million as a result of increases
in its investment during 2003 at december 31 2003 occidental owned 22 percent
395 million shares of lyondell stock with a carrying value of 479 million

disposition of chrome and calendering operations
     in the fourth quarter of 2002 occidental sold its chrome business at
castle hayne north carolina for 25 million and its plastic calendering
operations in rio de janeiro brazil for a 6 million note receivable in the
third quarter of 2002 occidental recorded an aftertax impairment charge of 69
million and classified both of these businesses as discontinued operations

corporate and other
     corporate and other includes the investments in lyondell and premcor inc
a refining business and a leased cogeneration facility in taft louisiana in
2004 corporate and other will also include the results of a 1300mile oil
pipeline and gathering system located in the permian basin which was acquired
in january 2004 and will be used in corporatedirected oil and gas marketing and
trading operations
     in july 2001 occidental sold its interests in a subsidiary that owned a
texas intrastate natural gas pipeline system and also sold its interest in a
liquefied natural gas lng project in indonesia aftertax proceeds of
approximately 750 million from these transactions were used to reduce debt

2004 outlook
oil and gas
     the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant
volatility due to numerous market forces crude oil and natural gas prices are
affected by market fundamentals such as weather inventory levels competing
fuel prices overall demand and the availability of supply
     in the last half of 2003 worldwide oil prices strengthened due to
increasing concerns about the security and availability of ample supplies to
meet growing demand continued economic growth resulting in increased demand
and concerns about supply availability could result in continued high prices a
lower growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices
     sustained high oil prices will significantly affect profitability and
returns for occidental and other upstream producers however the industry has
historically experienced wide fluctuations within price cycles although oil
prices cannot be predicted with any certainty the wti price has averaged
approximately 2250barrel over the past ten years
     while supplydemand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic
natural gas prices over the long term daytoday prices may be more volatile in
the futures markets such as on the nymex and other exchanges which make it
difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence over the last ten
years the nymex gas price has averaged 300 per mcf

chemical
     the chemical business has been profitable historically however the
average level of earnings has declined over the past several years the major
factors that have an impact on the performance of this business are general
economic conditions including demand for chemical products energy and
feedstock costs and the effect of changes in available capacity
     over the last five years the us chemical industry and its primary
market the us based manufacturing industry have faced significant
challenges foreign competition continues to make price increases by the us
manufacturing industry difficult to achieve in the chemical industry
increasing natural gas prices which affect us electricity prices have
sharply reduced and in many cases eliminated the domestic chemical industrys
natural advantage of proximity to its markets this has affected basic commodity
chemicals such as caustic soda chlorine and pvc but is particularly
significant for niche specialty products such as resorcinol mercaptans and
antimonybased products as a result the us based chemical industry is facing
increasing pressure from competitors in both domestic and export markets export
sales accounted for approximately 17 percent of occidentals 2003 chemical
sales
     the end of the most recent recession and resultant world economic recovery
is expected to improve the overall outlook
     construction of lng terminals on the us gulf coast could stabilize
natural gas prices at a lowerthancurrent level and thereby help improve the
competitive position of efficient gulf coast chemical facilities however this
may not occur in the immediate future although occidentals chemical business
is profitable if us manufacturing becomes noncompetitive on a worldwide
basis this could shorten the estimated productive lives of some of occidentals
plants resulting in higher annual depreciation significantly shorter
productive lives could also result in asset impairments including plant
closures it is unlikely that any changes in estimated productive lives would be
uniform while potential impairment charges could have a material impact on the
earnings in a discrete period such changes are unlikely to have a material
effect on occidentals overall financial situation
     for additional discussion of the possible financial effect please see the
critical accounting policies and estimates section below in the mda

chloralkali
     further improvement in chloralkali operating rates is expected in 2004 and
beyond as domestic demand for chlorine and caustic soda is forecasted to
increase 2 percent in 2004 pvc and other downstream derivatives are leading the
growth in demand for chlorine demand growth for caustic soda is expected to
track closely with overall manufacturing activity
     with increasing demand and improved capacity utilization pricing for
chlorine is expected to continue to rise compared to 2003 caustic soda prices
should also improve as overall manufacturing demand strengthens

vinyls
     gross domestic product gdp growth in the latter part of 2003 and
consensus forecasts of 2004 gdp growth exceeding 4 percent for north america are
encouraging and suggest a strengthening in the economy that will favorably
impact chlorovinyls overall occidental expects 2percent growth in vinyls
demand in north america in 2004 pvc and vcm operating rates are expected to
move upward during the year also averaging 2 percent higher than 2003 rates
     chlorovinyls supply constraints together with high energy costs have
created conditions for vinyls price increases early in 2004 resin producer
price increases of 2 cents per pound have taken effect for january and a second
2 cents per pound increase has been announced for february in addition vcm
intermediates are expected to be in shorter supply than pvc because of industry
capacity reductions and maintenance requirements average operating rates for
north american vcm producers are expected to exceed 90 percent
     the increased demand for chlorine and tighter vcm supplies due to capacity
reductions is expected to result in supply restrictions for vinyl producers

segment operations
     the following discussion of occidentals two operating segments and
corporate items should be read in conjunction with note 15 to the consolidated
financial statements

     core earnings in 2003 were 27 billion compared with 17 billion in 2002
the increase in core earnings primarily reflects the impact of higher crude oil
and natural gas prices and higher crude oil production volumes partially offset
by lower natural gas production volumes higher depreciation depletion and
amortization dda rates and increased costs

significant items affecting earnings
     occidentals results of operations often include the effects of significant
transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in
nature timing and amount therefore management uses a measure called core
earnings which excludes those items this nongaap measure is not meant to
disassociate those items from managements performance but rather is meant to
provide useful information to investors interested in comparing occidentals
earnings performance between periods reported earnings are considered
representative of managements performance over the long term core earnings is
not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles

     the higher balance in cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2003
compared to december 31 2002 reflects the buildup of cash part of which was
used to redeem 453 million of trust preferred securities in january 2004 the
higher balance in trade receivables at december 31 2003 compared with december
31 2002 reflects higher product prices and sales volumes during the fourth
quarter of 2003 versus 2002 in the oil and gas segment the decrease in income
tax receivable was due to a 2002 tax receivable from the equistar sale that was
received in 2003 the higher balance in investments in unconsolidated entities

investment additional purchases of lyondell and premcor stock and
marktomarket increases in the availableforsale premcor investment the
increase in the net balance in property plant and equipment reflects capital
spending the addition of the acquired permian basin assets and the
consolidation of the oxymar property plant and equipment as a result of the
adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no fin
46 partially offset by depreciation depletion and amortization
     the decrease in current maturities of longterm debt is due to the fact
that a lower level of debt will mature in 2004 the increase in accounts payable
is due to higher payable balances in the oil and gas marketing and trading
operations the decrease in accrued liabilities is due to lower marktomarket
adjustments on derivative financial instruments the decrease in dividends
payable is due to the fact that at the end of 2002 there were two quarters of
dividend accruals due to an early declaration in 2002 of a dividend paid in
2003 at june 30 2003 pursuant to the adoption of sfas no 150 the trust
preferred securities were reclassified to longterm liabilities at yearend
2003 they were further reclassified to current liabilities as occidental
announced its intention to redeem all of the trust preferred securities on
january 20 2004 all of the trust preferred securities were redeemed other
deferred credits and liabilities include deferred compensation other
postretirement benefits environmental remediation reserves asset retirement
obligations and other deferred items the increase in other deferred credits and
liabilities in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the asset retirement
obligation that was recorded in connection with the adoption of sfas no 143
the increase in stockholders equity primarily reflects net income and issuance
of new stock related to options exercised partially offset by dividends on
common stock

offbalancesheet arrangements
     in the course of its business activities occidental pursues a number of
projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives the accounting
and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the
varying methods of funding employed occidental also makes commitments on behalf
of unconsolidated entities these transactions or groups of transactions are
recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and unless
otherwise noted are not reflected on occidentals balance sheets the following
is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions

dolphin project
     see discussion of the dolphin project in the business review  oil and
gas middle east section of the mda above

ecuador
     in ecuador occidental has a 14percent interest in the ocp oil export
pipeline in the second half of 2003 the increased production from the
edenyuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of block 15 coincided with the
completion of the pipeline occidental made capital contributions of 64 million
in 2003 and as of december 31 2003 has contributed a total of 73 million to
the project occidental reports this investment in its consolidated statements
using the equity method of accounting
     the project was funded in part by senior project debt the senior project
debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of shiporpay tariffs of certain
upstream producers in ecuador including occidental under their shiporpay
commitments occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their
respective share of projectspecific risks including operating risk and
forcemajeure risk occidental would be required to make an advance tariff
payment in the event of prolonged force majeure upstream expropriation events
bankruptcy of the pipeline company or its parent company abandonment of the
project termination of an investment guarantee agreement with ecuador or
certain defaults by occidental this advance tariff would be used by the
pipeline company to service or prepay project debt occidentals obligation
relating to the pipeline companys senior project debt totaled 108 million and
occidentals obligations relating to performance bonds totaled 14 million at
december 31 2003 as occidental ships product using the pipeline its overall
obligations will decrease with the reduction of the pipeline companys senior
project debt

elk hills power
     occidental has a 50percent interest in elk hills power llc ehp a
limited liability company that operates a gasfired powergeneration plant in
california ehp is a variableinterest entity vie under the provisions of fin
46 occidental has concluded it is not the primary beneficiary of ehp and
therefore accounts for this investment using the equity method in january
2002 ehp entered into a 400 million construction loan facility which was
amended in may 2003 to increase the facility to 425 million upon construction
completion on july 17 2003 the facility converted to a 415 million term loan
50 percent of which is guaranteed by occidental

receivables sale program
     occidental has an agreement in place to sell under a revolving sale
program an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade receivables this
program is used by occidental as a lowcost source of working capital funding
the balance of receivables sold at december 31 2003 and 2002 was 360 million
this amount is not included in the debt and related trade receivables accounts
respectively on occidentals consolidated balance sheets receivables must meet
certain criteria to qualify for the program
     under this program occidental serves as the collection agent with respect
to the receivables sold an interest in new receivables is sold as collections
are made from customers fees and expenses under this program are included in
selling general and administrative and other operating expenses the fair value
of any retained interests in the receivables sold is not material the buyers of
the receivables are protected against significant risk of loss on their purchase
of receivables occidental provides for allowances for any doubtful receivables
based on its periodic evaluation of such receivables the provisions for such
receivables were not material in the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and
2001
     the program can terminate upon the occurrence of certain events which
generally are under occidentals control or relate to bankruptcy in such an
event alternative funding would have to be arranged which could result in an
increase in debt recorded on the consolidated balance sheet with a
corresponding increase in the accounts receivable balance the consolidated
income statement effect of such an event would not be significant

leases
     occidental has entered into various operatinglease agreements mainly for
railcars power plants manufacturing facilities and office space the leased
assets are used in occidentals operations where leasing offers advantages of
greater operating flexibility and generally costs less than alternative methods
of funding that were available at the time financing decisions were made lease
payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales see contractual obligation table
below

lawsuits claims commitments contingencies and related matters
     opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a substantial number
of lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings these actions seek among other
things compensation for alleged personal injury breach of contract property
damage punitive damages civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or
declaratory relief opc and certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in
proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and
liability act cercla and similar federal state and local environmental laws
these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and
in some cases compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages and
civil penalties however occidental is usually one of many companies in these
proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other
financially sound companies with respect to all such lawsuits claims and
proceedings including environmental proceedings occidental accrues reserves
when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated

     during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax
authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax
jurisdictions taxable years prior to 1997 are closed for us federal income
tax purposes taxable years 1997 through 2002 are in various stages of audit by
the internal revenue service disputes arise during the course of such audits as
to facts and matters of law
     occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to
secure terminal and pipeline capacity drilling services electrical power
steam and certain chemical raw materials at december 31 2003 the net present
value of the fixed and determinable portion of the obligations under these
agreements which were used to collateralize financings of the respective
suppliers aggregated 45 million which was payable as follows in millions
200412 200511 200610 20079 and 20083 fixed payments under
these agreements were 16 million in 2003 27 million in 2002 and 20 million
in 2001
     occidental has certain other commitments under contracts guarantees and
joint ventures and certain other contingent liabilities many of these
commitments although not fixed or determinable involve capital expenditures
and are part of the 14 billion capital expenditures estimated for 2004 and
the 250 to 300 million estimated to be spent on the dolphin project in 2004
     as discussed under significant accounting changes below fin 45 requires
the disclosure in occidentals financial statements of information relating to
guarantees issued by occidental and outstanding at december 31 2003
     these guarantees encompass performance bonds letters of credit
indemnities commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by occidental to
third parties mainly to provide assurance that occidental andor its
subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees
     at december 31 2003 the notional amount of the guarantees was
approximately 500 million of this amount approximately 400 million relates
to occidentals guarantee of equity investees debt and other commitments the
debt guarantees relating to elk hills power and the guarantees on debt and other
commitments relating to the ecuador pipeline have been discussed above in the
offbalancesheet arrangements section the remaining 100 million relates to
various indemnities and guarantees provided to third parties
     occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities
that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and
other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these
indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities
that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2003 occidental is not
aware of circumstances that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for
material amounts in connection with these transactions
     it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that
opc and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits claims and
proceedings audits commitments contingencies and related matters if these
matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially
exceeding occidentals reserves an outcome not currently anticipated it is
possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon
occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations however
after taking into account reserves management does not expect the ultimate
resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon
occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations

environmental liabilities and expenditures
     occidentals operations in the united states are subject to stringent
federal state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or
maintaining environmental quality foreign operations also are subject to
environmentalprotection laws costs associated with environmental compliance
have increased over time and are generally expected to rise in the future
environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the
overall business planning process these expenditures are mainly considered an
integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to
market demand

environmental remediation
     the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply
retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases in many cases the
laws apply regardless of fault legality of the original activities or current
ownership or control of sites opc or certain of its subsidiaries are currently
participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at
federal superfund sites comparable state sites and other remediation sites
including occidental facilities and previously owned sites also opc and
certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of
governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various
sites including in some instances having been named in proceedings under
cercla and similar federal state and local environmental laws these
proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases
compensation for alleged property damage punitive damages and civil penalties
     occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly
owned subsidiary glenn springs holdings inc gsh which reports its results
directly to occidentals corporate management

     occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current
environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next
ten or more years occidental expects that it may continue to incur additional
liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and
other sites the range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental
remediation matters could be up to 400 million beyond the amount accrued

a  includes 33 sites for which maxus energy corporation has retained the
     liability and indemnified occidental 7 sites where occidental has denied
     liability without challenge 57 sites where occidentals reserves are less
     than 50000 each and 12 sites where reserves are between 50000 and 1
     million each


     the seven sites with individual reserves over 10 million in 2003 are a
former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee two closed landfills
in western new york groundwater treatment facilities at three former chemical
plants western new york montague michigan and tacoma washington and a
municipal drinking water treatment plant in western new york

active facilities
     certain subsidiaries of opc are currently addressing releases of substances
from past operations at 13 active facilities four facilities  certain oil and
gas properties in the southwestern united states a chemical plant in louisiana
a chemical plant in texas and a phosphorous recovery operation in tennessee 
account for 89 percent of the reserves associated with these facilities

closed or sold facilities
     there are 39 sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of
opc that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements three sites
account for 72 percent of the reserves associated with this group the three
sites are an active refinery in louisiana where occidental indemnifies the
current owner and operator for certain remedial actions a water treatment
facility at a former coal mine in pennsylvania and a former chemical plant in
west virginia

     operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures
relate to longerlived improvements in currently operating facilities

do not contribute to current or future revenue generation although total costs
may vary in any one year over the long term segment operating and capital
expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase

     in october 2001 the federal environmental protection agency epa approved
a state implementation plan sip for eight counties in the houstongalveston
area of texas to implement certain requirements of the federal clean air act
the sip contains provisions requiring the reduction of 80 percent of nitrogen
oxide emissions and 60 percent of certain volatile organic compound emissions by
november 2007 occidental operates six facilities that are subject to the sips
emissions reduction requirements and estimates that its future capital
expenditures will total approximately 25 to 30 million for environmental
control and monitoring equipment necessary to comply with the sip occidental
expects expenditures to end in 2007 although the timing of the expenditures
will vary by facility
     occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental
compliance including the sip discussed above will be approximately 82 million
for 2004 and 97 million for 2005

foreign investments
     portions of occidentals assets outside north america are exposed to
political and economic risks occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to
mitigate its exposure against those risks at december 31 2003 the carrying
value of occidentals assets in countries outside north america aggregated
approximately 33 billion or approximately 18 percent of occidentals total
assets at that date of such assets approximately 23 billion are located in
the middle east approximately 759 million are located in latin america and
substantially all of the remainder are located in pakistan

critical accounting policies and estimates
     the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap
requires the management of occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding
certain items and transactions it is possible that materially different amounts
could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual
results differ from these estimates and judgments occidental considers the
following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve
the judgment of occidentals management there has been no material change to
these policies over the past three years the selection and development of these
critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit
committee of the board of directors

oil and gas properties
     occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and
gas properties under this method costs of acquiring properties costs of
drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized
annual lease rentals exploration costs geological geophysical and seismic
costs and exploratory dryhole costs are expensed as incurred
     proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil
natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls that geological and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from
known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering
future production and development costs there are several factors that could
change occidentals recorded oil and gas reserves occidental receives a share
of production from productionsharing contracts to recover its costs and an
additional share for profit occidentals share of production from these
contracts decreases when oil prices improve and increases when oil prices
decline overall occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is
greater at higher oil prices in other contractual arrangements sustained lower
product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves
becomes uneconomical estimation of future production and development costs is
also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidentals control
such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs
these factors in turn could lead to a reduction in the quantity of recorded
proved reserves an additional factor that could result in a change of proved
reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different from those assumed when
the reserves were initially recorded overall occidentals revisions to proved
reserves were positive for 2003 2002 and 2001 and amounted to less than 1
percent of the total reserves for each year additionally occidental is
required to perform impairment tests pursuant to sfas no 144 generally when
prices decline andor reserve estimates change significantly there have been no
impairments of reserves over the past three years
     depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is
determined by the unitofproduction method and could change with revisions to
estimated proved recoverable reserves the change in the depreciation and
depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve
estimates has been immaterial
     if occidentals oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors
mentioned above the most significant impact would be on the depreciation and
depletion rate for example a 5percent increase in the amount of oil and gas
reserves would change the rate from 482barrel to 458barrel which would
increase pretax income by 48 million annually a 5percent decrease in the oil
and gas reserves would change the rate from 482barrel to 506barrel and
would result in a decrease in pretax income of 48 million annually
     a portion of the carrying value of occidentals oil and gas properties is
attributable to unproved properties at december 31 2003 the costs
attributable to unproved properties were approximately 900 million these costs
are not currently being depreciated or depleted as exploration and development
work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven capitalized


                                       23

costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and
depletion if the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful the
capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be
expensed in the year in which the determination was made the timing of any
writedowns of these unproven properties if warranted depends upon the nature
timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their
results occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow
it to realize the unproved property balance

chemical assets
    the most critical accounting policy affecting occidentals chemical assets
is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its property plant and
equipment occidentals chemical plants are depreciated using either the
unitofproduction or straightline method based upon the estimated useful life
of the facilities the estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical assets
which range from 3 years to 50 years are used to compute depreciation expense
and are also used for impairment tests the estimated useful lives used for the
chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an
appropriate level of annual expenditures to maintain the facilities in good
operating condition without these continued expenditures the useful lives of
these plants could significantly decrease other factors that could change the
estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical plants include higher or lower
product prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign
competition feedstock costs energy prices environmental regulations
competition and technological changes
    occidental is required to perform impairment tests on its assets whenever
events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful
lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable or when managements plans change with respect to
those assets under the provisions of sfas no 144 occidental must compare the
undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value the key
factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product
prices which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign
competition feedstock costs energy costs significantly increased regulation
and remaining estimated useful life
     due to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products occidental
temporarily idled an edc plant in june 2001 a chloralkali plant in december
2001 and a portion of a chloralkali plant in june 2003 these facilities will
remain idle until market conditions improve management expects that these
plants will become operational in the future the net book value of these plants
was 156 million at december 31 2003 based on yearend value the chloralkali
plant that closed on december 1 2001 has a 24percent minority interest of 28
million these facilities are periodically tested for impairment and based on
the results no impairment is deemed necessary at this time occidental
continues to depreciate these facilities based on their remaining estimated
useful lives
    over the prior three years the change in the depreciation rate due to
changes in estimated useful lives has been immaterial
    occidentals net property plant and equipment for chemicals is
approximately 26 billion and its annual depreciation expense is expected to be
approximately 225 million if the estimated useful lives of occidentals
chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above the most
significant impact would be on depreciation expense for example a reduction in
the remaining useful lives of 20 percent would increase depreciation and reduce
pretax earnings by approximately 50 million per year

environmental liabilities and expenditures
     environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed
or capitalized as appropriate reserves for estimated costs that relate to
existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to
current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial
efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining
the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss occidental refers to
currently available information including relevant past experience available
technology regulations in effect the timing of remediation and costsharing
arrangements the environmental reserves are based on managements estimate of
the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted
as additional or new information becomes available for the years ended december
31 2003 and 2002 occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or
indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets
recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable
environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is
initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a
specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable the
reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been
established
     many factors could result in changes to occidentals environmental reserves
and reasonably possible range of loss the most significant are

   the original cost estimate may have been inaccurate

   modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required
     remediation results occidental generally assumes that the remedial
     objective can be achieved using the most costeffective technology
     reasonably expected to achieve that objective such technologies may
     include air sparging or phytoremediation of shallow groundwater or
     limited surface soil removal or insitu treatment producing acceptable risk
     assessment results should such remedies fail to achieve remedial
     objectives more intensive or costly measures may be required


                                       24
page


   the remedial measure might take more or less time than originally
     anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction sitespecific
     time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture
     rates anomalies in subsurface geology interactions between or among
     waterbearing zones and nonwaterbearing zones or the ability to identify
     and control contaminant sources

   the regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify occidentals
     proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action

     additionally other events might occur that could affect occidentals
future remediation costs such as

   the discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally
     anticipated for some sites with impacted groundwater accurate definition
     of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer
     modeling migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along
     geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected additionally the
     size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk
     assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial
     measures

   improved remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation in
     particular for groundwater remediation sites with projected longterm
     operation and maintenance the development of more effective treatment
     technology or acceptance of alternative and more costeffective treatment
     methodologies such as bioremediation could significantly affect
     remediation costs

   laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent
     remediation requirements

     at sites involving multiple parties occidental provides environmental
reserves based upon its expected share of liability when other parties are
jointly liable the financial viability of the parties the degree of their
commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to
participate are evaluated when estimating occidentals ultimate share of
liability based on these factors occidental believes that it will not be
required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible
parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable in an amount that would
have a material effect on occidentals consolidated financial position
liquidity or results of operations
     most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the
following three categories
     category 1 cercla or stateequivalent sites wherein occidental and other
alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in
accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations
     category 2 oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner
pays its proportionate share of remedial cost and
     category 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and
sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of
allocating the costs of environmental remediation
     in all three of these categories occidental records as a reserve its
expected net cost of remedial activities as adjusted by recognition for any
nonperforming parties
     in addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial
measures which often take in excess of ten years at cercla sites occidentals
reserves include managements estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance
of remedial systems to the extent that the remedial systems are modified over
time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws
regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and
changes the reserves accordingly on a sitespecific basis
     if the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease
based on the factors mentioned above the amount of the increase or decrease
would be immediately recognized in earnings for example if the reserve balance
were to decrease by 10 percent occidental would record a pretax gain of 37
million if the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent occidental would
record an additional remediation expense of 37 million

other loss contingencies
     occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits claims proceedings and
audits in the normal course of its operations occidental records a loss
contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been
impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its
exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these
matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be
incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that
they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet
     these reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to
the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate
managements judgments could change based on new information changes in laws or
regulations changes in managements plans or intentions the outcome of legal
proceedings settlements or other factors

significant accounting changes
     listed below are significant changes in occidentals accounting principles

sfas no 132 revised
     in december 2003 the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 132 employers
disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits to improve
financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans the standard requires
that companies provide more details about their plan assets benefit
obligations cash flows and other relevant information such as plan assets by
category a description of investment policies and strategies for these asset
categories and target allocation percentages or target ranges are also required

in financial statements this statement is effective for financial statements
with fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 occidental adopted this
statement in the fourth quarter of 2003 and provided the required disclosure in
this report

sfas no 150
     in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 accounting for certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas
no 150 establishes accounting standards for how a company classifies and
measures financial instruments that have characteristics of liabilities and
equity occidental adopted the provisions of this statement on july 1 2003 as
a result of the adoption occidentals mandatorily redeemable trust preferred
securities are now classified as a liability and the payments to the holders of
the securities which were previously recorded as minority interest on the
statement of operations are recorded as interest expense on january 20 2004
all of the trust preferred securities were redeemed

sfas no 149
     in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 amendment of statement 133 on
derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 149 amends and
clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments this
statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30
2003 occidental adopted this statement in the third quarter of 2003 and it did
not have a material effect on its financial statements

fin 46 and fin 46r revised
     in january 2003 the fasb issued fin 46 consolidation of variable
interest entities fin 46 requires a company to consolidate a vie if it is
designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does
not have a majority of voting interests a vie is generally defined as an entity
whose equity is unable to finance its activities or whose owners lack the risks
and rewards of ownership the statement also imposes disclosure requirements for
all the vies of a company even if the company is not the primary beneficiary
the provisions of this statement apply at inception for any entity created after
january 31 2003 occidental adopted the provisions of this interpretation for
its existing entities on april 1 2003 which resulted in the consolidation of
its oxymar investment as a result of the oxymar consolidation assets increased
by 166 million and liabilities increased by 178 million there was no material
effect on net income as a result of the consolidation in september 2003
marubeni indicated it would exercise its option to put its interest in oxymar to
occidental by paying approximately 25 million to occidental in connection with
the transfer which is expected to be complete in april 2004 occidental will
assume marubenis guarantee of oxymars debt as all the oxymar debt is already
consolidated in occidentals financial statements with the adoption of fin 46
the exercise of the put will not have a material effect on occidentals
financial position or results of operations
     see offbalancesheet arrangements  elk hills power for information on
vies where occidental is not the primary beneficiary
     in december 2003 the fasb revised fin 46 to exempt certain entities from
its requirements and to clarify certain issues arising during the initial
implementation of fin 46 occidental will adopt the revised interpretation in
the first quarter of 2004 and it is not expected to have an impact on the
financial statements when adopted

fin 45
     in january 2003 the fasb issued fin 45 guarantors accounting and
disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of
indebtedness of others fin 45 requires a company to recognize a liability for
the obligations it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee this liability would
be recorded at the inception of a guarantee and would be measured at fair value
fin 45 also requires certain disclosures related to guarantees which are
included in note 9 occidental adopted the measurement provisions of this
statement in the first quarter of 2003 and it did not have an effect on the
financial statements when adopted

eitf issue no 023
     in the third quarter of 2002 occidental adopted certain provisions of
emerging issues task force eitf issue no 023 issues involved in accounting
for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in
energy trading and risk management activities these provisions prescribed
significant changes in how revenue from energy trading is recorded
historically occidental had two major types of oil and gas revenues 1
revenues from its equity production and 2 revenues from the sale of oil and
gas produced by other companies but purchased and resold by occidental
referred to as revenue from trading activities both types of sales involve
physical deliveries and had been historically recorded on a gross basis in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with the adoption of
eitf issue no 023 occidental now reflects the revenue from trading activities
on a net basis there were no changes in gross margins net income cash flow or
earnings per share for any period as a result of adopting this requirement
however net sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting
amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement for the years ended
december 31 2002 and 2001 net sales and cost of sales were reduced from
amounts previously reported by approximately 22 billion representing amounts
for the first two quarters of 2002 and 58 billion respectively to conform
to the current presentation
     since 1999 occidental has accounted for certain energytrading contracts
in accordance with eitf issue no 9810 accounting for contracts involved in
energy trading and risk management activities eitf issue no 9810 required
that all energytrading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and
losses included in earnings whether the contracts were derivatives or not


                                       26
page


in october 2002 the eitf rescinded eitf issue no 9810 thus precluding
marktomarket accounting for all energytrading contracts that are not
derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third
parties also the rescission requires derivative gains and losses to be
presented net on the income statement whether or not they are physically
settled if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes occidental
adopted this accounting change in the first quarter of 2003 and recorded a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles charge of approximately
18 million after tax

sfas no 146
     in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 146 requires that a
liability be recognized for exit and disposal costs only when the liability has
been incurred and when it can be measured at fair value the statement is
effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december 31
2002 occidental adopted sfas no 146 in the first quarter of 2003 and it did
not have a material effect on its financial statements

sfas no 145
     in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 rescission of fasb statements
no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical
corrections in addition to amending or rescinding other existing authoritative
pronouncements to make various technical corrections clarify meanings or
describe their applicability under changed conditions sfas no 145 precludes
companies from recording gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt as an
extraordinary item occidental implemented sfas no 145 in the fourth quarter of
2002 and all comparative financial statements have been reclassified to conform
to the 2002 presentation since occidental had no 2002 extraordinary items
there was no effect on the 2002 presentation the effects of the statement on
prior years include the reclassification of an extraordinary loss to net income
from continuing operations of 8 million 002 per share in 2001 there was no
effect on net income or basic earnings per common share upon adoption

sfas no 143
     in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset
retirement obligations sfas no 143 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived
assets and the associated asset retirement costs under sfas no 143 companies
are required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if there is a legal
obligation to dismantle the asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the
end of the useful life occidental adopted sfas no 143 in the first quarter of
2003 the initial adoption resulted in an aftertax charge of 50 million which
was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles the
adoption increased net property plant and equipment by 73 million increased
asset retirement obligations by 151 million and decreased deferred tax
liabilities by 28 million the proforma asset retirement obligation if the
adoption of this statement had occurred on january 1 2002 would have been 131
million at january 1 2002 and 151 million at december 31 2002

sfas no 142
     in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets sfas no 142 changes the accounting and reporting requirements for
acquired goodwill and intangible assets the provisions of this statement are
applied to companies starting with fiscal years beginning after december 15
2001 at december 31 2001 the balance sheet included approximately 108
million of goodwill and intangible assets with annual amortization expense of
approximately 6 million recorded in each of the years income statements for
the threeyear period ended december 31 2001 as a result elimination of
goodwill amortization would not have had a material impact on net income or
earnings per share of any of the years presented and as a result the
transitional disclosures of adjusted net income excluding goodwill amortization
described by sfas no 142 have not been presented upon implementation of sfas
no 142 in the first quarter of 2002 three separate specialty chemical
businesses were identified as separate reporting units and tested for goodwill
impairment all three of these businesses are components of the chemical
segment the fair value of each of the three reporting units was determined
through third party appraisals the appraisals determined fair value to be the
price that the assets could be sold for in a current transaction between willing
parties as a result of the impairment testing occidental recorded a cumulative
effect of changes in accounting principles aftertax reduction in net income of
approximately 95 million due to the impairment of all the goodwill attributed
to these reporting units

sfas no 133
     on january 1 2001 occidental adopted sfas no 133 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended this statement
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
hedging activities and required an entity to recognize derivatives on the
balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value changes in the
derivative instruments fair value must be recognized in earnings unless
specific hedge accounting criteria are met adoption of this new accounting
standard resulted in cumulative aftertax reductions in net income of
approximately 24 million and other comprehensive income oci of approximately
27 million in the first quarter of 2001 the adoption also increased total
assets by 588 million and total liabilities by 639 million as of january 1
2001

intangible assets
     the eitf currently is deliberating on eitf no 03o whether mineral
rights are tangible or intangible assets and eitf no 03s application of fasb
statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets to oil and gas
companies these proposed statements will determine whether contractbased oil
and gas mineral rights are classified as tangible or intangible assets based on
the eitfs interpretation of sfas no 141 and sfas no 142 historically
occidental has classified all of its contractbased mineral rights within
property plant and equipment and has generally not identified these amounts
separately if the eitf determines that these mineral rights should be presented
as intangible assets occidental would have to reclassify its contractbased oil
and gas mineral rights acquired after june 30 2001 to intangible assets and
make additional disclosures in accordance with sfas no 142 if occidental
adopted this change approximately 492 million and 226 million of the
property plant and equipment balance would be reclassified to intangible assets
at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively these amounts which are net of
accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization include approximately 475
million and 210 million of mineral rights related to proved properties at
december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively occidental has been amortizing these
amounts under the unitofproduction method and would continue to amortize the
mineral rights under this method based on its understanding of the scope of the
eitf deliberations occidental believes the adoption of this potential decision
would have no material effect on its results of operations

derivative activities and market risk
general
     occidentals market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices
and to a lesser extent interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates
occidental periodically enters into derivative instrument transactions to reduce
these price and rate fluctuations a derivative is a financial instrument which
derives its value from another instrument or variable
     in general the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on
quoted market prices dealer quotes and the blackscholes or similar valuation
models

accounting for derivatives and definitions
     occidental applies either fair value or cash flow hedge accounting when
transactions meet specified criteria to obtain hedge accounting treatment if
the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge the
gain or loss is immediately recognized in earnings if the derivative qualifies
for hedge accounting the gain or loss on the derivative is either recognized in
income with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged for
fair value hedges or deferred in oci to the extent the hedge is effective for
cash flow hedges
     a hedge is regarded as highly effective and qualifies for hedge accounting
if at inception and throughout its life it is expected that changes in the
fair value or cash flows of the hedged item are almost fully offset by the
changes in the fair value or changes in cash flows of the hedging instrument and
actual effectiveness is within a range of 80 percent to 125 percent in the case
of hedging a forecasted transaction the transaction must be highly probable and
must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately
affect reported net profit or loss occidental discontinues hedge accounting
when it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a
hedge when the derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised when
the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid or when a forecasted transaction
is no longer deemed highly probable

commodity price risk
general
     occidentals results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural
gas prices based on current levels of production if oil prices vary overall by
1 per barrel it would have approximately a 125 million annual effect on
income before us income tax if natural gas prices vary by 025 per mcf it
would have approximately a 48 million annual effect on income before us
income tax if production levels change in the future the sensitivity of
occidentals results to oil and gas prices also would change
     occidentals results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices
if chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by 10ton it would have approximately
a 12 million and 25 million respectively annual effect on income before us
income taxes if pvc prices vary by 01lb it would have approximately a 27
million annual effect on income before us income taxes if edc prices vary by
10ton it would have approximately a 3 million annual effect on income before
us income taxes historically price changes either precede or follow raw
material and feedstock price changes therefore the margin improvement of price
changes can be mitigated according to chemical market associates inc
december 2003 average contract prices were chlorine203ton caustic
soda133ton pvc044lb and edc228ton

marketing and trading operations
     occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to
achieve the best prices for oil and gas derivatives are also used by occidental
to reduce its exposure to price volatility and mitigate fluctuations in
commodityrelated cash flows occidental enters into lowrisk marketing and
trading activities through its separate marketing organization which operates
under established policy controls and procedures with respect to derivatives
used in its oil and gas marketing operations occidental utilizes a combination
of futures forwards options and swaps to offset various physical transactions
overall occidental has a low level of involvement in the hedging of longterm
oil and gas prices and its use of derivatives in hedging activity remains at a
correspondingly low level


                                       28
page


     in september 2002 occidental unwound its natural gas delivery commitment
and corresponding natural gas price swap which were entered into in november
1998 occidental recognized a pretax loss of 3 million related to these
transactions

risk management
     occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities
which include buying selling marketing trading and hedging activities
under the controls and governance of its risk management policy the chief
financial officer and risk management committee comprising members of
occidentals management oversee these controls which are implemented and
enforced by the trading control officer the trading control officer provides an
independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities
controls for energy commodities include limits on credit limits on trading
segregation of duties delegation of authority and a number of other policy and
procedural controls

commodity hedges
     on a limited basis occidental uses cashflow hedges for the sale of crude
oil and natural gas production crude oil cashflow hedges were executed for
approximately 20 percent of total us oil production in 2002 natural gas
cashflow hedges were executed for approximately 7 percent of total us 2002
gas production occidentals commodity cashflowhedging instruments in 2002
were highly effective at december 31 2002 all of these cashflow hedges had
been settled no fair value hedges were used for oil and gas production during
2003 or 2002 and no cash flow hedges were used for the sale of production in
2003

quantitative information
     occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes
in fair values of commoditybased derivatives and commodity contracts used in
trading activities this method determines the maximum potential negative
shortterm change in fair value with a 95percent level of confidence for
nontrading activities there were no material amounts outstanding at december
31 2003

     the value at risk for both oil and natural gas is summarized below

interest rate risk
general
     occidental is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates and
it enters into various derivative financial instruments to manage interestrate
exposure interestrate swaps forward locks and futures contracts are entered
into periodically as part of occidentals overall strategy

hedging activities
     occidental has entered into several interestrate swaps that qualified for
fairvalue hedge accounting these derivatives effectively convert approximately
18 billion of fixedrate debt to variablerate debt with maturities ranging
from 2005 to 2009


                                       29
page


     occidental was a party to a series of forward interestrate locks which
qualified as cashflow hedges the hedges were related to the construction of a
cogeneration plant leased by occidental that was completed in december 2002 the
remaining loss on the hedges through december 2003 was approximately 21 million
aftertax which is recorded in accumulated oci and is being recognized in
earnings over the lease term of 26 years on a straightline basis
     certain of occidentals equity investees have entered into additional
derivative instruments that qualified as cashflow hedges occidental reflects
its proportionate share of these cashflow hedges in oci

credit risk
     occidentals energy contracts are spread among numerous counterparties
creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and
on an ongoing basis occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure
relative to credit limits and manages creditenhancement issues credit
exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances current month
activity and forward marktomarket exposure

foreign currency risk
     several of occidentals foreign operations are located in countries whose
currencies generally depreciate against the us dollar typically effective
currency forward markets do not exist for these countries therefore occidental
attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and
liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for
operating purposes generally international crude oil sales are denominated in
us dollars additionally all of occidentals oil and gas foreign entities
have the us dollar as the functional currency however in one foreign
chemical subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency
occidental has exposure on us dollardenominated debt that is not material at
december 31 2003 and 2002 occidental had not entered into any foreign currency
derivative instruments the effect of exchangerate transactions in foreign
currencies is included in periodic income

selected cashflow information
     occidental calculates chemical segment free cash flow as segment income
adding back depreciation depletion and amortization and subtracting from that
amount total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions occidental believes
that free cash flow is useful to investors as an indicator of occidentals
ability to generate positive cash results to service andor repay debt and
generate cash for acquisitions and other investments free cash flow does not
represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures changes
in working capital are not reflected in free cash flow and occidental has
certain nondiscretionary obligations such as debt service that are not
deducted from this measure in addition this measure should not be considered
in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap or
as a measure of profitability or liquidity free cash flow as presented herein
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies
there is no comparable segment cashflow measure available under gaap

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations mda incorporating item 7a

     in this report the term occidental refers to occidental petroleum
corporation andor one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting
interest subsidiaries occidental is divided into two segments oil and gas
and chemical

2002 business environment
oil and natural gas industry
     oil and gas prices are the key variables that drive the industrys
financial performance prices can vary even on a shortterm basis the average
west texas intermediate wti market price for 2002 was 2608barrel bbl
compared with 2597bbl in 2001 from a low point of less than 2000bbl in
2001 prices have improved to a fourth quarter of 2002 average price of
2815bbl which was the strongest quarter for oil prices since the first
quarter of 2001
     nymex domestic natural gas prices began 2002 at approximately 250 per
thousand cubic feet mcf but increased during the year for the fourth quarter
of 2002 gas prices averaged 357mcf compared with 255mcf for the fourth
quarter of 2001

chemical industry
     the chemical industry continued to struggle throughout the year due to poor
economic conditions however several commodity chemical product prices improved
moderately due to the resilient building and construction industry and marginal
improvement in demand for general durable goods


                                       8
page


     domestic chlorine demand improved slightly in 2002 compared to 2001 due to
the modest growth across all markets other than vinyl chloride monomer vcm
despite modest growth in chlorine demand prices remained strong and improved
significantly through the year strong chlorine prices resulted from a 5 percent
overall decrease in industry capacity and unplanned production outages caustic
soda prices declined through the second quarter due to a slow rebound in
downstream product demand but improved in the fourth quarter as supply became
tighter polyvinyl chloride pvc prices improved reflecting the ability to pass
through price increases in feedstock costs as well as strong demand in building
and construction markets resulting in some margin improvement

strategic overview and review of business results  2000  2002

strategy
     occidentals overall corporate strategy aims to generate competitive total
returns to stockholders and consists of three basic elements

   focus on large longlived oil and gas assets with growth potential
   maintain financial discipline and strengthen the balance sheet
   harvest cash from chemicals

     large longlived legacy oil and gas assets like those in california the
permian basin in texas and qatar tend to have moderate decline rates enhanced
secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead
to costeffective production these assets are expected to contribute strong
earnings and cash flow and serve as a strong foundation for new growth
initiatives
     at occidental maintaining financial discipline means prudently investing
capital in projects that are expected to generate abovecostofcapital returns
from these investments throughout the business cycle during periods of high
commodity prices occidental will use the bulk of its cash flow after capital
and dividends to reduce the volatility of its earnings either through debt
reduction or to a lesser extent by acquiring additional properties with
lowrisk characteristics occidental may also sell properties to reduce debt and
to fund other higherreturn acquisitions while strengthening the balance sheet
to reduce risk and increase earnings
     the chemicals business provides free cash flow from 1995 through 2002
cash flow after subtracting capital expenditures from the chemicals business
totaled 30 billion this does not include asset sales net of acquisitions
which provided an additional 10 billion


specific actions
oil and gas
     the oil and gas business strategy has three parts that together are
focused on adding new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace well ahead of
production while simultaneously keeping finding and development costs among the
lowest in the industry
   continue to add commercial reserves in and around occidentals core areas
     which are the us middle east and latin america through a combination of
     focused exploration and development programs
   pursue commercial opportunities with host governments in core areas to
     enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining
     oil in place by applying appropriate technology and innovative
     reservoirmanagement practices
   maintain a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive
     prices

     occidentals oil and gas operations are located in california kansas
oklahoma new mexico and texas domestically and in colombia ecuador oman
pakistan qatar russia united arab emirates and yemen internationally
occidental also has interests in several other countries
     the asset mix within each of the core areas has been strengthened
occidental has sold properties with low or no current return and invested in
assets with higher performance potential the results of these changes are
discussed below in business review  oil and gas

chemical
     occidental manufactures and markets basic chemicals vinyls and performance
chemicals directly and through various affiliates collectively oxychem
oxychem focuses on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with chlorine which
is coproduced with caustic soda and then converts chlorine and ethylene
through a series of intermediate products into pvc
     in august 2002 occidental and lyondell chemical company completed an
agreement for occidental to sell its 295percent share of equistar to lyondell
and to purchase a 21percent equity interest in lyondell occidental entered
into these transactions to diversify its petrochemicals interest these
transactions reduced occidentals direct exposure to petrochemicals volatility
yet allowed it to maintain a presence and preserve through its lyondell
investment an economic upside when the petrochemicals industry recovers

corporate
     in july 2001 occidental sold its interests in a subsidiary that owned a
texas intrastate pipeline system and its interest in a liquefied natural gas
lng project in indonesia aftertax proceeds of approximately 750 million
from these transactions were used to reduce debt
     in april 2000 occidental sold its interest in canadian occidental
petroleum ltd renamed nexen inc canadianoxy or nexen aftertax proceeds
together with tax benefits from the disposition of oilproducing properties in
peru at the same time totaling 700 million were used to reduce debt following
the altura acquisition

business review  oil and gas
     occidentals overall performance during the past several years reflects the
successful implementation of its oil and gas business strategy beginning with
the 1998 35 billion acquisition of the elk hills oil and gas field in
california the elk hills acquisition was followed in april 2000 by the
purchases of both altura energy in texas for 36 billion and the thums property
in long beach california for 68 million
     at the end of 2002 these three assets made up 69 percent of occidentals
worldwide proven oil reserves and 55 percent of its proven gas reserves on a
barrel of oil equivalent boe basis they accounted for 67 percent of
occidentals worldwide reserves in 2002 the combined production from these
assets averaged approximately 290000 boe per day which represents 56 percent
of occidentals total worldwide production these businesses also contributed
approximately 60 percent of oil and gas segment earnings and 85 percent of oil
and gas segment free cash flow

elk hills
     occidental operates the elk hills oil and gas field in the southern portion
of californias san joaquin valley with an approximate 78percent interest the
field reserves are among the top ten in the lower 48 united states and the field
is the largest producer of gas in california production increased in 2002 to
approximately 101000 boe per day from approximately 99000 boe per day in 2001
elk hills has generated total net cash flow after subtracting 696 million of
capital expenditures of approximately 28 billion since occidental acquired
the asset in early 1998
     since the date of acquisition occidental has replaced 109 percent of its
total elk hills oil and gas production of 173 million boe at the end of 2002
the property still had an estimated 440 million boe of proved reserves compared
to the 425 million boe that were recorded at the time of the acquisition

permian basin
     occidental integrated the altura properties with its previously existing
permian basin properties in southwest texas and southeast new mexico since the
acquisition the former altura properties have generated more than 18 billion
in total net cash flow after subtracting capital expenditures of approximately
400 million
     one element of occidentals strategy in the permian basin is to acquire
producing properties at attractive prices that offer synergies with its existing
operations in 2002 occidental made a number of small acquisitions in the
permian basin for a total purchase price of 73 million these acquisitions
accounted for total proven reserve additions of 533 million boe for an average
cost of 136 per boe
     total permian oil and gas production averaged 164000 boe per day in 2002
compared to 162000 boe per day in 2001 net permian oil production averaged
142000 barrels per day in 2002 compared to 137000 barrels per day in 2001
occidental is the largest oil producer in texas
     approximately 50 percent of occidentals permian basin production is
reliant upon the application of carbon dioxide co2 flood technology an
enhanced oil recovery technique a portion of which is supplied by the bravo
dome co2 unit this involves injecting co2 into oil reservoirs where it acts as
a solvent causing the oil to flow more freely so it can be pumped to the
surface the size of these co2 flood operations makes occidental a world leader
in the development and application of this technology in 2002 occidental
implemented two large co2 projects one in the cogdell field in west texas and
the other in hobbs new mexico when these two projects become fully
operational they are expected to add approximately 10000 boe per day to
occidentals production

thums
     occidental purchased thums the field contractor of the long beach unit an
oil and gas production unit offshore long beach california in 2000 it is part
of the wilmington field which is the fourth largest oil field in the
continental us at yearend 2002 net production from the thums oil property
was averaging 26000 barrels per day
     occidental completed construction of a 45megawatt gasfired power plant
and began generating electricity in december 2002 previously the oil fields
operations depended on the local utility for power to operate electric pumps
critical to production the electricity supply from the utility was
interruptible meaning that when power was in short supply service could be
temporarily discontinued electricity is the largest component of operating
costs for this field and by securing a reliable source of electricity it will
be possible to reduce overall field production costs

gulf of mexico
     in july 2000 occidental completed agreements with respect to two
transactions involving its interests on the continental shelf in the gulf of
mexico gom and the proceeds were used to reduce debt
     occidental has a onethird interest in the deep water horn mountain oil
field which is its primary asset in the gom bp plc bp is the operator
the discovery well which was drilled to a depth of nearly 14000 feet is
located about 60 miles off the louisianamississippi coast in 5400 feet of
water
     development work was completed on time and under budget and the field began
production in november 2002 with a yearend exit rate of approximately 9000
net boe per day net proved reserves are approximately 36 million boe

hugoton
     occidental owns a large concentration of gas reserves production interests
and royalty interests in the hugoton area of kansas and oklahoma the hugoton
field is the largest natural gas field discovered to date in north america
occidentals hugoton operations produced 148000 mcf of natural gas and 3000
barrels of oil per day in 2002

middle east
dolphin project
     in 2002 occidental purchased a 245percent interest in dolphin energy
limited del the operator of the dolphin project the dolphin project which
is expected to cost its owners 35 billion in total consists of two parts 1
a development and production sharing agreement with qatar to develop and produce
natural gas and condensate in qatars north field and 2 the rights for del to
build own and operate a 260milelong 48inch export pipeline to transport 2
billion cubic feet per day of dry natural gas from qatar to markets in the uae
for a period of 25 years the pipeline will have capacity to transport up to 32
billion cubic feet per day which will allow for additional business development
projects del is currently negotiating contracts to market the gas with users in
the uae construction on the upstream production and processing facilities and
the pipeline is expected to begin in 2003 and production is scheduled to begin
in early 2006 the dolphin partners anticipate securing project financing
occidental has not recorded any revenue or production costs for this project and
no oil and gas reserves have been included in its 2002 proved oil and gas
reserves

oman
     occidentals oman business centers on its 300million barrel discovery in
block 9 in which it has a 65percent working interest occidental has produced
more than 150 million gross barrels from the block most of it from the safah
field
     net production to occidental averaged 13000 barrels of oil per day in the
fourth quarter
     occidental uses multilateral horizontal wells to increase production and
recovery rates and to minimize the number of wells needed today 60 percent of
occidentals production in oman relies on horizontal wells a new waterflood
program is currently under way at safah that will enhance production and improve
the ultimate recovery of reserves from the field
     occidental recently entered into an agreement which is awaiting government
approval to sell an estimated 120  130 million cubic feet of natural gas per
day from block 9 operations to the omani government beginning in early 2004 and
extending through 2007 the occidentalomani agreement is expected to open up a
market for previously stranded gas that is associated with oil production from
the safah field occidental also continues its exploration program in the
adjacent block 27

yemen
     in yemen occidental owns direct working interests in the masila field in
block 14 38 percent and the east shabwa field in block 10 286 percent in
addition occidental has interests in seven exploration blocks encompassing
nearly 15 million acres of these occidental is the operator of blocks 44 and
20 with working interests of 75 percent and 50 percent respectively and has a
40percent working interest in each of five blocks  blocks 11 12 36 54 and
59  on the border with saudi arabia occidentals net production averaged
38000 barrels of oil per day in 2002 with 32000 coming from the masila field
and the remainder from east shabwa a series of stepout wells at masila in 2002
added 5 million barrels of new reserves
     occidental drilled and completed two exploratory wells in block 20 in late
2002 and completed a 2d seismic program in the third quarter of 2002 in block
44

qatar
     in qatar occidental successfully reversed 25 years of declining production
in the idd el shargi north dome isnd field by introducing advanced drilling
systems and by applying new waterflooding and reservoir characterization
techniques occidental is increasing production and recoverable reserves from
the fields 4 billion barrels of remaining oil in place


                                       11
page


     occidental is moving forward under a new agreement with a second phase in
the development of isnd the new phase is targeting the development and recovery
of 145 million gross barrels of additional reserves from isnd
     occidental is also engaged in fullfield development of the idd el shargi
south dome issd field which as a satellite to the north dome reduces the
overall capital requirement of the two projects
     combined production from the two fields averaged 42000 barrels per day
net to occidental in 2002
     when the second phase of isnd and the fullfield development of issd are
fully completed occidental expects its total net production from qatar to
increase to approximately 76000 barrels per day in 2006 reserves net to
occidental related to these projects are expected to total 94 million barrels
     also see the dolphin project discussed above

saudi arabia
     in saudi arabia occidental has a 20percent interest in the core venture
two consortium which is proposing to invest in the red sea area to help the
kingdom identify and develop new natural gas reserves for the domestic market

other eastern hemisphere
pakistan
     occidental holds oil and gas working interests that vary from 25 to 50
percent in four badin blocks in pakistan bp is the operator in 2002
occidental purchased additional interests in two of these blocks from the
government of pakistan for approximately 72 million current gross production
is 65000 boe per day while occidentals net share is approximately 25000 boe
per day
     current plans call for drilling 13 to 15 wells per year to develop new and
existing fields additionally occidental continues to evaluate various
exploration opportunities

russia
     in russia occidental owns 50 percent of a joint venture company
vanyoganneft that operates in the western siberian oil basin production for
2002 was approximately 27000 boe per day net to occidental

latin america
colombia
     occidental has a 35percent net share of production and is operator of the
cano limon oil field in colombia colombias national oil company ecopetrol

pipeline transports oil produced from the cano limon field for export to
international markets in addition occidental has an 88percent working
interest in two exploration blocks encompassing 6647 square miles in the
central llanos basin
     in 2002 production from occidentals cano limon operations in colombia
increased substantially from 2001 due to improved security along the export
pipeline that reduced the number of attacks by local terrorist groups the
pipeline was subjected to a record number of attacks in 2001 occidentals net
share of 2002 production averaged 35000 barrels of oil per day compared to
18000 barrels per day in 2001 this operation accounts for less than one
percent of occidentals worldwide assets only two percent of total worldwide
reserves and less than seven percent of average worldwide oil and gas production
in 2002 occidental presently anticipates that it will recover the proved
reserves attributable to its contract

ecuador
     gross production in block 15 in 2002 which occidental operates with a
60percent working interest averaged approximately 13000 barrels of oil per
day net to occidental
     full field development of the eden yuturi oil field in the southeastern
corner of block 15 is complete fullscale production is scheduled to coincide
with the anticipated completion in the second half of 2003 of the oleoducto de
crudos pesados ocp ltd oil export pipeline in which occidental has a
12percent interest in addition work continues in the producing areas in the
western portion of the block the combined effect of these projects is expected
to add total net incremental production of 30000 barrels per day to
occidentals production profile in 2004
     in addition occidental is expanding its exploration activities in block 15
with aggressive 3d seismic and drilling programs
     in 2000 occidental farmed out a 40percent economic interest in block 15
in ecuador to alberta energy company ltd aec now encana as a result of this
transaction encana agreed to fund a significant portion of the capital program
     foreign oil companies including occidental have been paying value added
tax vat generally calculated on the basis of 1012 percent of expenditures
for goods and services used in the production of oil for export until 2001 oil
companies like other companies producing products for export filed for and
received reimbursement of vat in 2001 the ecuador tax authority announced that
the oil companies vat payments did not qualify for reimbursement in response
the affected oil companies filed actions in the ecuador tax court to seek a
judicial determination that the expenditures are subject to reimbursement in
november 2002 occidental initiated an international arbitration proceeding
against the ecuadorian government under the united statesecuador bilateral
investment treaty based on occidentals belief that the ecuadorian government is
arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refund the vat to occidental
occidental believes that it has a valid claim for reimbursement under applicable
ecuador tax law and the treaty in the event of an unfavorable outcome the
potential income statement effect would not be significant

productionsharing contracts
     occidental conducts its operations in qatar oman and yemen under
productionsharing contracts occidental receives a share of production from
productionsharing contracts to recover its costs and an additional share for
profit occidentals share of production from these contracts decreases when oil
prices improve and increases when oil prices decline overall occidentals net
economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices

business review  chemical
chloralkali
     2002 saw increased demand for chlorine in all major market segments
particularly vcm propylene oxide and epichlorohydrin domestic demand for
coproduct caustic soda was flat year over year and exports from the us
declined
     the chloralkali industry entered 2002 coming off the lowest operating rate
since 1985 as a result of increased demand coupled with a full year of
capacity reductions in 2002 industryoperating rates increased from 81 percent
in the fourth quarter of 2001 to a peak of 93 percent in the third quarter of
2002 annual operating rates increased from 85 percent for 2001 to 89 percent
for 2002
     prices for chlorine followed the demand curve and increased steadily
throughout the year declining total demand for caustic soda coupled with
increased electrochemical unit ecu production led to falling caustic soda
prices through the third quarter
     although markets have improved steadily in 2002 oxychem has maintained its
deer park chloralkali production facility in houston texas in a standby mode
pending further strengthening in overall economic conditions and improved demand
for caustic soda
     oxychem successfully began commercial operation of a 778megawatt
cogeneration facility in taft louisiana in the fourth quarter of 2002 this
facility provides all of the steam and electric power requirements for the taft
louisiana chloralkali plant at a lower cost than if the plant were to generate
its own steam and purchase electricity from a public utility it sells excess
power in the merchant market

vinyls
     2002 saw improvement in north american pvc resin demand following a
strengthening trend which began in early 2001 for the year north american pvc
resin demand grew at a rate of approximately 5 percent the 2002 market
exhibited strong growth through july with more moderate growth in the third
quarter followed by seasonal contraction in the fourth quarter
     as a result of higher demand together with lower inventory levels in much
of the chain industryoperating rates climbed from the low 80 percent levels of
the second half of 2001 to above 90 percent for the second and third quarters of
2002 although pvc resin capacity remains in oversupply tightness in vcm and
chlorine feedstocks have constrained vinyls production levels throughout the
year
     vinyls prices reflected this tightness by rising 14 centslb in the first
seven months of 2002 prices to vinyls export markets peaked somewhat earlier in
the year then retreated during the third quarter due primarily to a sharp
reduction in chinese imports prices posted improvements in late fourth quarter
as spot buyers anticipated supply constraints for 2003 coupled with an overall
improvement in demand in southeast asia

2003 outlook
oil and gas
     the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant
volatility due to numerous market forces crude oil and natural gas prices are
affected by market fundamentals such as weather inventory levels competing
fuel prices overall demand and the availability of supply
     in the last half of 2002 worldwide oil prices strengthened due to
increasing political and economic turmoil in venezuela and the growing threat of
conflict with iraq venezuela alone accounts for approximately 13 percent of
total us oil imports these uncertainties raised concerns about the security
and availability of ample supplies to meet growing demand in 2003 continued
unrest in venezuela and the middle east portend significant volatility for
shortterm crude oil prices and continued price uncertainty over the longterm
if the turmoil continues well into 2003 the result could be a continued
tightening of crude oil supplies and correspondingly higher prices conversely
a lessening of the uncertainties could result in greater crude oil supply and
lower prices
     sustained high oil prices will significantly impact profitability and
returns for occidental and other upstream producers however the industry has
historically experienced wide fluctuations within price cycles for example the
average price of wti crude oil in the first quarter of 2002 was 2164bbl
compared to 2815 in the fourth quarter although oil prices cannot be
predicted with any certainty wti price has averaged approximately 2125barrel
over the past ten years
     while supplydemand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic
natural gas prices over the long term daytoday prices may be more volatile in
the futures markets such as on the nymex and other exchanges which make it
difficult to predict prices with any degree of confidence
     over the longterm volatile prices sharp production decline rates and the
uncertain timing of new gas supplies in response to new gasrelated drilling
place constraints on the domestic gas supply industry record high gasrelated
drilling rates in the first half of 2001 added very little new domestic
production capacity increasing uncertainty about the 2003 gas supply outlook
particularly as drilling declined in the wake of falling prices in the first
half of 2002
     the early onset of severe winter weather for the 20022003 heating season
contributed to an increase in gas prices in the second half of 2002 however
this did not spark a corresponding increase in gasdriven drilling activity
giving rise to expectations of steeper production decline rates in 2003 robust
prices in 2003 could lead to a new upsurge in gasrelated drilling to address
longerterm supply uncertainties

chemical
     the performance of the chemical business is difficult to forecast but this
business is capable of contributing significant earnings and cash flow when
demand is strong the major factors that have an impact on the performance of
the chemicals business are general economic conditions energy and feedstock
costs and the effect of changes in productive capacity

chloralkali
     further improvement in ecu operating rates is expected as domestic demand
for both chlorine and caustic soda are forecasted to increase over 2 percent in
2003 and industry capacity is expected to decline further pvc and other
derivatives not manufactured by occidental are leading the growth in demand for
chlorine growth in demand for caustic soda is expected to track overall
manufacturing activity
     with increasing demand and increased capacity utilization pricing for
chlorine is expected to improve slightly over the fourth quarter 2002 levels
caustic soda prices are expected to show a marked improvement over 2002 as
contracts reflect previously announced price increases and overall supply and
demand become more balanced
     energy costs for 2003 are expected to increase over 2002 levels

vinyls
     occidental expects north american pvc resin demand to grow 4  5 percent
for 2003 based on annual us and global gdp growth expectations of
approximately 25 percent north american pvc operating rates are expected to
continue to move upward in 2003 averaging 1  2 percent higher than 2002 rates
     chlorovinyls supply constraints together with spiking energy costs have
created conditions for vinyls price increases early in 2003 in addition vcm
intermediates will be in shorter supply than pvc because of industry capacity
rationalizations and maintenance requirements operating rates for north
american vcm producers are expected to average well above 90 percent
     energy and raw material price escalation will limit margin growth in 2003
tightness in chlorine supply for vinyls production will remain a concern in
2003

income summary
     occidental reported net income of 10 billion 263 per share in 2002
on net sales of 73 billion compared with net income of 12 billion 310
per share in 2001 on net sales of 81 billion core earnings were 10
billion in 2002 and 12 billion in 2001

segment operations
     the following discussion of occidentals two operating segments and
corporate items should be read in conjunction with note 15 to the consolidated
financial statements

corporate expenses discontinued operations and cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principles but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment
assets and results from equity investments

not allocated to segments except for amounts in lieu thereof that represent the
tax effect of operating charges resulting from purchase accounting adjustments
and the tax effects resulting from major infrequently occurring transactions
such as asset dispositions and legal settlements that relate to segment results

a  occidentals results of operations often include the effects of significant
     transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and
     unpredictably in nature timing and amount therefore management uses a
     measure called core earnings which excludes those items this nongaap
     measure is not meant to disassociate those items from managements
     performance but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors
     interested in comparing occidentals earnings performance between periods
     core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in
     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
b  the 2002 amount includes a 33 million writeoff for lost hills leases and
     a 25 million writeoff of the thunderball well both in california and
     the 2001 amount includes a 66 million writeoff of the gibraltar well in
     colombia
c  includes mineral acquisitions but excludes significant acquisitions
     individually discussed in this report
d  includes capitalized portion of injected co2 of 42 million 48 million
     and 44 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively
e  these amounts exclude implied taxes

     occidental explores for and produces oil and natural gas domestically and
internationally occidental seeks longterm growth and improvement in
profitability and cash flow through a combination of increased operating
efficiencies in core assets enhanced oil recovery projects focused exploration
opportunities and complementary property acquisitions
     core earnings in 2002 were 17 billion compared with 24 billion in 2001
the decrease in core earnings primarily reflects the impact of lower natural gas
prices and production volumes partially offset by higher crude oil prices and
production volumes

a  occidentals results of operations often include the effects of significant
     transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and
     unpredictably in nature timing and amount therefore management uses a
     measure called core earnings which excludes those items this nongaap
     measure is not meant to disassociate those items from managements
     performance but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors
     interested in comparing occidentals earnings performance between periods
     core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in
     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
b  product volumes produced at former polyone facilities now part of
     oxyvinyls are excluded from the product indexes
c  product volumes include products produced and consumed internally

     core earnings were 111 million in 2002 compared with 13 million in 2001
the increase in core earnings reflects the impact of higher average prices for
chlorine edc and pvc resins and lower raw material costs partially offset by
lower prices for caustic soda and overall lower volumes

additional considerations regarding funding and liquidity
     in the course of its business activities occidental pursues a number of
projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives the accounting
and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the
varying methods of funding employed occidental also makes commitments on behalf
of unconsolidated entities these transactions or groups of transactions are
recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and unless
otherwise noted are not reflected on occidentals balance sheets the following
is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions

 oil and gas transactions
ecuador
     in ecuador occidental has a 12percent interest in a company currently
constructing an oil export pipeline which is expected to be completed in 2003
construction of the pipeline has made it feasible for occidental to develop the
eden yuturi field it discovered several years ago in the southeastern corner of
block 15 the development of eden yuturi together with ongoing work in the
western portion of the block that is currently in production is expected to add
net incremental production of 30000 barrels per day in 2004 all of which is
expected to be transported through the new pipeline occidental has committed to
make capital contributions up to its share currently estimated to be
approximately 64 million of the estimated total project capital requirements
as of december 31 2002 occidental has


                                       17

contributed 9 million to the project occidental reports this investment in its
consolidated statements using the equity method of accounting
     the project is being funded in part by senior project debt the senior
project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of shiporpay tariffs of certain
upstream producers in ecuador including occidental under their shiporpay
commitments occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their
respective share of projectspecific risks including construction risk
operating risk and forcemajeure risk occidental would be required to make an
advance tariff payment in the event of termination of the agreement authorizing
the pipeline company to build the pipeline prolonged delay in project
completion prolonged force majeure upstream expropriation events bankruptcy
of the pipeline company or its parent company abandonment of the project
termination of an investment guarantee agreement with ecuador or certain
defaults by occidental this advance tariff would be used by the pipeline
company to service or prepay project debt occidentals obligation relating to
the pipeline companys senior project debt totaled 101 million and the
completion bonds and other bonds totaled 17 million at december 31 2002 as
occidental ships product using the pipeline its overall obligations will
decrease with the reduction of the pipeline companys senior project debt

elk hills power
     occidental and sempra energy sempra each has a 50percent interest in elk
hills power llc a limited liability company that is currently constructing a
gasfired powergeneration plant in california occidental accounts for this
investment using the equity method in january 2002 elk hills power llc entered
into a 400 million construction loan facility occidental guarantees 200
million 50 percent of the loan facility at december 31 2002 approximately
162 million of debt guaranteed by occidental was outstanding

 chemical transactions
taft cogeneration facility
     occidental is leasing a cogeneration facility which was completed in 2002
this facility supplies all the steam and electric power requirements for
occidentals taft chloralkali plant at a lower cost than if the plant were to
generate its own steam and purchase electricity from a public utility an owner
trust with investors as participating beneficiaries owns the project the equity
participants in the owner trust funded the owner trust with equity during
construction in the amount of three percent of the cumulative project costs
throughout the period and in an amount in excess of 14 percent of the final
project costs upon the commencement of the lease term in connection with the
completion of construction and satisfaction of certain other conditions the
26year term of the operating lease commenced in december 2002 at december 31
2002 occidental estimates the present value of the remaining lease payments to
be 455 million


leases
     occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements mainly for
railcars power plants manufacturing facilities and office space the leased
assets are used in occidentals operations where leasing offers advantages of
greater operating flexibility and generally costs less than alternative methods
of funding that were available at the time financing decisions were made lease
payments are charged to occidentals operations mainly as cost of sales
     the accounting treatment for the leases described above including the taft
lease is dictated by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 13
and other related pronouncements issued by the financial accounting standards
board fasb these leases have been classified as operating leases in
accordance with the operating lease criteria as discussed under additional
accounting changes below fasb interpretation fin no 46 is expected to
result in the consolidation of certain variable interest entities that are
owners of plant and equipment occidental leases from them the probable
consolidation would affect the laporte texas vcm plant lease if consolidation
were to take place there would be no significant effect on occidentals
financial condition however consolidation would result in an increase in
assets of approximately 132 million and liabilities of 154 million with an
aftertax charge of approximately 22 million in the third quarter of 2003 that
would be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles
annual expense for depreciation would increase by approximately 12 million
pretax if occidental chose to terminate the leases prior to adoption there
would be no cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles

oxymar
     occidental has a 786percent ownership interest before minority interest
in oxymar occidental owns 286 percent of oxymar directly and the oxyvinyls
partnership which is 76percent owned by occidental owns 50 percent
therefore after minority interest occidentals effective ownership interest is
67 percent marubeni corporation marubeni owns the remaining 214 percent of
oxymar but has a 50percent voting interest the oxymar vcm plant is a modern
efficient manufacturing facility occidentals chlorovinyls business derives
significant economic benefit from oxymars operations as the supplier of certain
products to oxymar oxymar in turn supplies vcm required by occidental to
manufacture pvc this investment in oxymar is recorded as an equity investment
on the consolidated balance sheet occidental guarantees 50 percent of oxymars
165 million private placement bonds due 2016 and 100 percent of a 220 million
revolving line of credit which matures in 2005 under which 105 million was
outstanding at december 31 2002 these amounts are reflected as debt on
oxymars balance sheet marubeni has a right to put its interest in oxymar to
occidental in 2004 by paying approximately 25 million to occidental and in
connection with this


                                       18

transfer require occidental to assume marubenis guarantee of oxymars debt
occidental determined that marubenis strike price was equal to fair value as of
the issue date and assigned a fair value of zero to the option therefore
occidental did not record an asset or liability associated with this put option
in the consolidated financial statements since the put price was negotiated on
armslength terms and has no predetermined conditions that would require
exercise of the option occidental cannot determine whether marubeni will
exercise its option occidental does not expect to record a loss if the option
is exercised if oxymar were to be consolidated at december 31 2002 assets
would increase by 172 million and liabilities would increase by 163 million on
occidentals consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2002 occidental
had advanced 95 million to oxymar and had a net equity investment of 30
million as discussed under additional accounting changes below fin no 46
is expected to result in the consolidation of oxymar in the third quarter of
2003 this consolidation is not expected to have a significant effect on
occidentals financial condition and will not change occidentals results of
operations

ingleside
     occidental and conocophillips conoco each has a 50percent interest in
ingleside cogeneration limited partnership a limited partnership ingleside
lp which operates a cogeneration plant in texas the cogeneration facility
supplies all of the steam and electric power requirements to occidentals
ingleside chloralkali plant and oxymars vcm plant at less cost than if these

receivables sale program
    occidental has an agreement in place to sell under a revolving sale
program an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade receivables this
program is used by occidental as a lowcost source of working capital funding
the balance of receivables sold at december 31 2002 and 2001 was 360 million
this amount is not included in the debt and related trade receivables accounts
respectively on occidentals consolidated balance sheets receivables must meet
certain criteria to qualify for the program
     under this program occidental serves as the collection agent with respect
to the receivables sold an interest in new receivables is sold as collections
are made from customers fees and expenses under this program are included in
selling general and administrative and other operating expenses the fair value
of any retained interests in the receivables sold is not material the buyers of
the receivables are protected against significant risk of loss on their purchase
of receivables occidental provides for allowances for any doubtful receivables
based on its periodic evaluation of such receivables the provisions for such
receivables were not material in the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and
2000
     the program terminates upon certain events including occidentals senior
debt rating falling below investment grade in such an event alternative
funding would have to be arranged which could result in an increase in debt
recorded on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding increase in the
accounts receivable balance the consolidated income statement effect of such an
event would not be significant

     the higher balance in trade receivables at december 31 2002 compared with
december 31 2001 reflects higher product prices during the fourth quarter of
2002 versus 2001 the increase in receivables from joint ventures partnerships
and other is due to higher marktomarket adjustments on derivative financial
instruments in the marketing and trading group the increase in inventories was
primarily the result of higher gas trading inventory the increase in income tax
receivable was due to a tax receivable from the equistar sale the decrease in
the longterm receivables net account is due to the redemption of the notes
from the altura partners the higher balance in investments in unconsolidated
subsidiaries primarily reflects the dolphin project and lyondell acquisitions
partially offset by the sale of the equistar investment the increase in the net
balance in property plant and equipment reflects capital spending partially
offset by depreciation depletion and amortization
     the increase in current maturities of longterm debt reflects a
reclassification of the current portion of longterm debt the increase in
accounts payable is due to higher payable balances in the oil and gas marketing
and trading operations the increase in accrued liabilities is due to the timing
of interest accruals on debt the increase in dividends payable is due to an
early declaration of the first quarter 2003 dividend payable in april 2003 the
decrease in longterm debt primarily reflects the reclassification of longterm
debt to current maturities partially offset by marktomarket adjustments
related to fair value hedges on a portion of the debt in accordance with hedge
accounting applicable debt balances are also marked to fair value which
offsets the change in fair value of the derivative the current and longterm
portions of the obligations under the natural gas delivery commitment were
eliminated since this commitment was terminated in 2002 other deferred credits
and liabilities include deferred compensation other postretirement benefits
environmental remediation reserves contract advances deferred revenue and
other deferred items the decrease in minority interest is due to the redemption
of the remaining altura interests in may 2002 the 2002 minority interest
balance also includes 75 million of preferred stock issued to a financial
institution by a subsidiary of occidental in december 2002 the increase in
stockholders equity primarily reflects net income partially offset by
dividends on common stock

models

accounting for derivatives and definitions
     occidental accounts for its derivatives under the provisions of sfas no
133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended
by sfas no 137 and sfas no 138 collectively sfas no 133 under sfas no
133 recognition of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a
derivative to fair market value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding
the derivative gains and losses from derivatives that are not designated as
hedges are recognized immediately in earnings a hedge is considered effective
if changes in its value are offset exactly by changes in the value of the item
being hedged a hedge is ineffective to the extent changes in its value are not
matched by offsetting changes in value for the item being hedged if a
derivative is used to hedge the fair value of an asset or liability fair value
hedge the gains or losses from adjusting the derivative to its market value
are recognized in earnings immediately and to the extent the hedge is effective
offset the concurrent recognition in earnings of changes in the fair value of
the hedged item gains or losses from derivatives used to hedge future cash
flows cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet in accumulated other
comprehensive income oci a component of stockholders equity until the
transaction that is hedged is recognized in earnings however to the extent the
value of the derivative differs from the value of the anticipated cash flows of
the hedged transaction the hedge is considered partly ineffective and the
resulting gains or losses are recognized immediately in earnings

commodity price risk
general
     occidentals results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural
gas prices based on current levels of production if oil prices vary overall by
1 per barrel it would have approximately a 110 million annual effect on
income before us income tax if natural gas prices vary by 010 per million
btu mmbtu it would have approximately a 19 million annual effect on income
before us income tax if production levels change in the future the
sensitivity of occidentals results to oil and gas prices also would change
     occidentals results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices
if chlorine or caustic soda prices vary by 10ton it would have approximately
a 10 million and 26 million respectively annual effect on income before us
income taxes if pvc prices vary by 01lb it would have approximately a 35
million annual effect on income before us income taxes if edc prices vary by
10ton it would have approximately a 6 million annual effect on income
before us income taxes according to chemical market associates inc
december 2002 average contract prices were chlorine  215ton caustic soda 
148ton pvc  037lb and edc  220ton

marketing and trading operations
     occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to
achieve the best prices for oil and gas derivatives are also used by occidental
to reduce its exposure to price volatility and mitigate fluctuations in
commodityrelated cash flows occidental enters into lowrisk marketing and
trading activities through its separate marketing organization which operates
under established policy controls and procedures with respect to derivatives
used in its oil and gas marketing operations occidental utilizes a combination
of futures forwards options and swaps to offset various physical transactions
overall occidental usually remains unhedged to longterm oil and gas prices and
its use of derivatives in hedging activity remains at a low level

and corresponding natural gas price swap which were entered into in november
1998 occidental recognized a pretax loss of 3 million related to these
transactions

     the tables above include the fair value of physical positions and the fair
value of the related financial instruments for trading and marketing operations
at december 31 2002 and 2001 the physical positions were a net gain of 42
million and a net loss of 2 million respectively the value of the derivative
financial instruments that offset these physical positions are a net loss of 8
million at december 31 2002 and a net gain of 9 million at december 31 2001
gains and losses are netted in the statement of operations on the balance
sheets except where a right of setoff exists gains are recognized as assets
and losses are recognized as liabilities

commodity hedges
     on a limited basis occidental uses cashflow hedges for the sale of crude
oil and natural gas crude oil cashflow hedges were executed for approximately
20 percent and 29 percent of total us oil production in 2002 and 2001
respectively natural gas cashflow hedges were executed for approximately 7
percent of total us 2002 gas production occidentals commodity
cashflowhedging instruments were highly effective at december 31 2002 all
of these cashflow hedges were settled no fair value hedges were used for oil
and gas production during 2002

quantitative information
     occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes
in fair values of derivatives and commodity contracts used in trading
activities this method determines the maximum potential negative shortterm
change in fair value with a 95 percent level of confidence for nontrading
activities there were no material amounts outstanding at december 31 2002

     the value at risk for both oil and natural gas is summarized below

interest rate risk
general
     occidental is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates and
it enters into various derivative financial instruments to manage interestrate
exposure interestrate swaps forward locks and futures contracts are entered
into periodically as part of occidentals overall strategy


hedging activities
     occidental has entered into several interestrate swaps that qualified for
fairvalue hedge accounting these derivatives effectively convert approximately
13 billion of fixedrate debt to variablerate debt with maturities ranging
from 2005 to 2008
     occidental was a party to a series of forward interestrate locks which
qualified as cashflow hedges the hedges were related to the construction of a
cogeneration plant that was completed in december 2002 and leased by occidental
concurrently the associated loss on the hedges through december 2002 is
approximately 21 million aftertax which is recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income oci and will be recognized in earnings over the lease
term of 26 years on a straightline basis
     certain of occidentals equity investees have entered into additional
derivative instruments that qualified as cashflow hedges occidental reflects
its proportionate share of these cashflow hedges in oci

credit risk
     occidentals energy contracts are spread among numerous counterparties
creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and
on an ongoing basis occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure
relative to credit limits and manages creditenhancement issues credit
exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances current month
activity and forward marktomarket exposure

foreign currency risk
     several of occidentals foreign operations are located in countries whose
currencies generally depreciate against the us dollar on a continuing basis
typically effective currency forward markets do not exist for these countries
therefore occidental attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing
monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels
necessary for operating purposes generally

accounting for energytrading activities
     in the third quarter of 2002 occidental adopted certain provisions of
emerging issues task force eitf issue no 023 issues involved in accounting
for contracts under issue no 9810 these provisions prescribe significant
changes in how revenue from energy trading is recorded occidental has two major
types of oil and gas revenues 1 revenues from its equity production and 2
revenues from the sale of oil and gas produced by other companies but purchased
and resold by occidental referred to as revenue from trading activities both
types of sales involve physical deliveries and had been historically recorded on
a gross basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with
the adoption of eitf issue no 023 occidental now reflects the revenue from
trading activities on a net basis there were no changes in gross margins net
income cash flow or earnings per share for any period as a result of adopting
this requirement however net sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and
offsetting amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement occidental has
not engaged in any of the roundtrip trading activities that were the focus of
the fercs energyindustry investigation activity in 2002 for the years ended
december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 net sales and cost of sales were reduced from
amounts previously reported by approximately 22 billion representing amounts
for the first two quarters of 2002 58 billion and 49 billion
respectively to conform to the current presentation
     since 1999 occidental has accounted for certain energytrading contracts
in accordance with eitf issue no 9810 accounting for contracts involved in
energy trading and risk management activities eitf issue no 9810 required
that all energytrading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and
losses included in earnings whether the contracts were derivatives or not in
october 2002 the eitf rescinded eitf issue no 9810 thus precluding
marktomarket accounting for all energytrading contracts that are not
derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third
parties also the rescission requires derivative gains and losses to be
presented net on the income statement whether or not they are physically
settled if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes occidental
will adopt this accounting change in the first quarter of 2003 and expects to
record a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles charge of
approximately 19 million after tax starting january 1 2003 occidental no
longer records energytrading contracts that are not derivatives on a
marktomarket basis

taxes
     deferred tax liabilities were 868 million at december 31 2002 net of
deferred tax assets of 733 million the current portion of the deferred tax
assets of 114 million is included in prepaid expenses and other the net
deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income
and reversal of taxable temporary differences

lawsuits claims commitments contingencies and related matters
     occidental petroleum corporation opc and certain of its subsidiaries have
been named in a substantial number of lawsuits claims and other legal
proceedings these actions seek among other things compensation for alleged
personal injury breach of contract property damage punitive damages civil
penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief opc and certain
of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the comprehensive
environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar
federal state and local environmental laws these environmental proceedings
seek funding or performance of remediation and in some cases compensation for
alleged property damage punitive damages and civil penalties however
occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date
been successful in sharing response costs with other financiallysound
companies with respect to all such lawsuits claims and proceedings including
environmental proceedings occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a
liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated
     during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by tax
authorities for varying periods in various federal state local and foreign tax
jurisdictions taxable years prior to 1996 are closed for us federal income
tax purposes taxable years 1996 through 2000 are in various stages of audit by
the internal revenue service disputes arise during the course of such audits as
to facts and matters of law
     at december 31 2002 commitments for major capital expenditures during
2003 and thereafter were approximately 158 million
     occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to
secure terminal and pipeline capacity drilling services electrical power
steam and certain chemical raw materials at december 31 2002 the net present
value of the fixed and determinable portion of the obligations under these
agreements which were used to collateralize financings of the respective
suppliers aggregated 94 million which was payable as follows in millions
200321 200419 200516 200614 200711 and 2008 through
201913 fixed payments under these agreements were 27 million in 2002 20
million in 2001 and 42 million in 2000
     occidental has certain other commitments under contracts guarantees and
joint ventures and certain other contingent liabilities many of these
commitments although not fixed or determinable involve capital expenditures
and are part of the 13 billion capital expenditures estimated for 2003
     as discussed under additional accounting changes below fin no 45
requires the disclosure in occidentals financial statements of information
relating to guarantees issued by occidental and outstanding at december 31
2002
     these guarantees encompass performance bonds letters of credit
indemnities commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by occidental to
third parties mainly to provide assurance that occidental andor its
subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees
     at december 31 2002 the notional amount of the guarantees was
approximately 1 billion of this amount approximately 700 million relates to
occidentals guarantee of equity investees debt and other commitments an
additional 200 million relates to the laporte texas vcm plant operating lease
and other equipment leases the foregoing items have also been discussed above
in the additional considerations regarding funding and liquidity section
specifically the debt guarantees relating to oxymar and elk hills power the
guarantees on debt and other commitments relating to the ecuador pipeline and
the residual value guarantee of the laporte texas vcm plant operating lease
the remaining 100 million relates to various indemnities and guarantees
provided to third parties
     occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities
that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and
other transactions that they have entered into with occidental these
indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities
that reach specified thresholds as of december 31 2002 occidental is not
aware of circumstances that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for
material amounts in connection with these transactions
     it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that
opc and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits claims and
proceedings audits commitments contingencies and related matters if these
matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially
exceeding occidentals reserves an outcome not currently anticipated it is
possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon
occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations however
after taking into account reserves management does not expect the ultimate
resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon
occidentals consolidated financial position or results of operations

environmental expenditures
     occidentals operations in the united states are subject to stringent
federal state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or
maintaining the quality of the environment foreign operations also are subject
to environmentalprotection laws costs associated with environmental compliance
have increased over time and are generally expected to rise in the future
environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the
overall business planning process these expenditures are mainly considered an
integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to
market demand

environmental remediation
     the laws which require or address environmental remediation may apply
retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases in many cases the
laws apply regardless of fault legality of the original activities or current
ownership or control of sites

opc or certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental
assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal superfund sites comparable
state sites and other remediation sites including occidental facilities and
previously owned sites also opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been
involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings
involving historical practices at various sites including in some instances
having been named in proceedings under cercla and similar federal state and
local environmental laws these proceedings seek funding or performance of
remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage
punitive damages and civil penalties
     occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly
owned subsidiary glenn springs holdings inc gsh which reports its results
directly to occidentals corporate management

     in determining the environmental remediation reserves occidental refers to
currently available information including relevant past experience available
technology regulations in effect the timing of remediation and costsharing
arrangements occidental expects that it will continue to incur additional
liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and
other sites the range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental
remediation matters could be up to 400 million beyond the amount accrued many
factors could result in changes to occidentals environmental reserves and
reasonably possible range of loss the most significant are
   the original cost estimate may have been inaccurate
   modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required
     remediation results occidental generally assumes that the remedial
     objective can be achieved using the most costeffective technology
     reasonably expected to achieve that objective such technologies may
     include air sparging or phytoremediation of shallow groundwater or
     limited surface soil removal or insitu treatment producing acceptable risk
     assessment results should such remedies fail to achieve remedial
     objectives more intensive or costly measures may be required
   the remedial measure might take more or less time than originally
     anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction sitespecific
     time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture
     rates anomalies in subsurface geology interactions between or among
     waterbearing zones and nonwaterbearing zones or the ability to identify
     and control contaminant sources
   the regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify occidentals
     proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action

     additionally other events might occur that could affect occidentals
future remediation costs such as

   the discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally
     anticipated for some sites with impacted groundwater accurate definition
     of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer
     modeling migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along
     geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected additionally the
     size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk
     assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial
     measures
   remediation technology might improve to decrease the cost of remediation
     in particular for groundwater remediation sites with projected longterm
     operation and maintenance the development of more effective treatment
     technology or acceptance of alternative and more costeffective treatment
     methodologies such as bioremediation could significantly affect
     remediation costs
   laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent
     remediation requirements

percent of the reserves associated with these facilities

closed or sold facilities
     there are 44 sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of
opc that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements three sites
account for 66 percent of the reserves associated with this group the three

     operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures
relate to longerlived improvements in currently operating facilities
remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and
do not contribute to current or future revenue generation although total costs
may vary in any one year over the long term segment operating and capital
expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase
     eight counties in the houstongalveston area are subject to a federal
environmental protection agency epa mandate to adopt a plan for implementing
certain requirements of the federal clean air act known as a state
implementation plan in october 2001 the epa approved a state implementation
plan for the houstongalveston area the plan in december 2002 the texas
commission on environmental quality revised the regulations associated with the
plan the revised plan contains provisions requiring the reduction of 80 percent
of current nitrogen oxide nox emissions and 60 percent of the volatile organic
compound voc emissions in the houstongalveston area by november 2007
occidental operates six facilities that will be subject to the plans nox and
vocreduction requirements occidental estimates that over the next several
years its capital expenditures will increase by a total of 70  120 million
for environmental control and monitoring equipment necessary to comply with the
plan depending on the amount of emissions reduction that is ultimately
required occidental began expending the capital necessary to comply with the
plan in 2001 and expects expenditures to end in 2007 although the timing of the
expenditures will vary by facility
     occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental
compliance including the plan discussed above will be approximately 72
million for 2003 and 95 million for 2004

foreign investments
     portions of occidentals assets outside north america are exposed to
political and economic risks occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to
mitigate its exposure against those risks at december 31 2002 the carrying
value of occidentals assets in countries outside north america aggregated
approximately 28 billion or approximately 17 percent of occidentals total
assets at that date of such assets approximately 19 billion are located in
the middle east approximately 628 million are located in latin america and
substantially all of the remainder are located in pakistan

critical accounting policies
     the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap
requires the management of occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding
certain items and transactions it is possible that materially different amounts
could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual
results differ from these estimates and judgments occidental considers the
following to be its most critical accounting policies which involve the judgment
of occidentals management

oil and gas properties
     occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and
gas properties under this method costs of acquiring properties costs of
drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized
annual lease rentals exploration costs geological geophysical and seismic
costs and exploratory dryhole costs are expensed as incurred
     proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil
natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls that geological and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from
known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering
future production and development costs there are several factors which could
change occidentals recorded oil and gas reserves significantly higher or lower
product prices could lead to changes in the amount of reserves due to economic
limits or the effects of productionsharing contracts occidental receives a
share of production from productionsharing contracts to recover its costs and
an additional share for


                                       28
page


profit occidentals share of production from these contracts decreases when oil
prices improve and increases when oil prices decline overall occidentals net
economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices in other
contractual arrangements sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation
where production of reserves becomes uneconomical this in turn could lead to
a reduction in the quantity of recorded reserves an additional factor that
could result in a change of recorded reserves is the reservoir decline rates
being different than those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded
estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change
partially due to factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and
inflation or deflation of oil field service costs overall occidentals
revisions to recorded proved reserves were positive for 2002 2001 and 2000 and
amounted to less than 1 percent 1 percent and 7 percent respectively
additionally occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to
sfas no 144 when prices decline andor reserve estimates change significantly
there have been no impairments over the past three years
     depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is
determined by the unitofproduction method and could change with revisions to
estimated proved recoverable reserves the change in the depreciation and
depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve
estimates has been immaterial
     if occidentals oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors
mentioned above the most significant impact would be on the depreciation and
depletion rate a 5 percent increase in the amount of oil and gas reserves would
change the rate from 427barrel to 406barrel which would increase net
income by 26 million annually a 5 percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves
would change the rate from 427barrel to 448barrel and would result in a
decrease in net income of 26 million annually
     a portion of the carrying value of occidentals oil and gas properties are
attributable to unproved properties at december 31 2002 the costs
attributable to unproved properties were approximately 13 billion these costs
are not currently being depreciated or depleted as exploration and development
work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven capitalized
costs of the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion if the
development work were to be unsuccessful the capitalized costs of the
properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in
which the determination was made the timing of any writedowns of these unproven
properties if warranted depends upon the nature timing and extent of future
exploration and development activities and their results occidental believes
its exploration and development efforts will allow it to fully realize the
unproved property balance

chemical assets
     the most critical accounting policy affecting occidentals chemical assets
is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its property plant and
equipment the estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical assets which
range from 3 years to 50 years are used to compute depreciation expense and are
also used for impairment tests the estimated useful lives used for the chemical
facilities were based on the assumption that occidental would provide an
appropriate level of annual capital expenditures while the plants are still in
operation without these continued capital expenditures the useful lives of
these plants could significantly decrease other factors which could change the
estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical plants include higher or lower
product prices feedstock costs energy prices environmental regulations
competition and technological changes
     occidental is required to perform impairment tests on its assets whenever
events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful
lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable or when managements plans change with respect to
those assets under the provisions of sfas no 144 occidental must compare the
undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value the key
factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product
prices feedstock costs energy costs and remaining estimated useful life
     due to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products occidental
temporarily idled an edc plant in june 2001 and a chloralkali plant in
december 2001 these facilities will remain idle until market conditions
improve management expects that both of these plants will become operational in
the future the net book value of these two plants was 150 million at december
31 2002 these facilities were tested for impairment at the time they were
temporarily idled and based on the results no impairment was deemed necessary
for these two facilities occidental continues to depreciate these facilities
based on their remaining estimated useful lives
     occidentals chemical plants are depreciated using either the
unitofproduction or straightline method based upon the estimated useful life
of the facilities the change in the depreciation rate over the prior three
years has been immaterial
     if the estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical plants were to
decrease based on the factors mentioned above the most significant impact would
be on depreciation expense if the estimated remaining useful lives were to
decrease by 10 percent the annual depreciation charge would increase from 164
million to 182 million

environmental costs and contingencies
     environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed
or capitalized as appropriate reserves for estimated costs that relate to
existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to
current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial
efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining
the reserves occidental refers to currently available information including
relevant past experience available technology regulations in effect the
timing of remediation and costsharing arrangements the environmental reserves
are based on managements estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and
are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes
available for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 occidental has not
accrued any reimbursements or recoveries as assets recoveries and
reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable environmental
reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially
established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site
and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable the reserve
methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established
     at sites involving multiple parties occidental provides environmental
reserves based upon its expected share of liability when other parties are
jointly liable the financial viability of the parties the degree of their
commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to
participate are evaluated when estimating the companys ultimate share of
liability occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of
liability of other potentially responsible parties with whom it is alleged to
be jointly liable in an amount that would have a material effect on
occidentals consolidated financial position or liquidity or results of
operations
     most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the
following three categories

     category 1 cercla or stateequivalent sites wherein occidental and other
alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in
accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations
     category 2 oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner
pays its proportionate share of remedial cost and
     category 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and
sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of
allocating the costs of environmental remediation

     in all three of these categories occidental records as a reserve its
expected net cost of remedial activities as adjusted by recognition for any
nonperforming parties
     in addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial
measures which often take in excess of ten years at cercla sites occidentals
reserves include managements estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance
of remedial systems to the extent that the remedial systems are modified over
time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws
regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and
changes the reserves accordingly on a sitespecific basis

     the following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three
reporting periods

     occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current
environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next
ten or more years
     if the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease
based on the factors mentioned above the amount of the increase or decrease
would be immediately recognized in earnings if the reserve balance were to
decrease by 10 percent the company would record a pretax gain of 39 million
if the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent the company would record
an additional pretax remediation expense of 39 million

other loss contingencies
     occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits claims proceedings and
audits in the normal course of its operations occidental records a loss
contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been
impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its
exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these
matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be
incurred in order to assess its loss contingencies occidental reviews its loss
contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the
balance sheet
     these reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to
the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate
managements judgments could change based on new information changes in laws or
regulations changes in managements plans or intentions the outcome of legal
proceedings settlements or other factors

additional accounting changes
     listed below are additional changes in accounting principles applicable to
occidental

fin no 46
     in january 2003 the fasb issued fin no 46 consolidation of variable
interest entities fin no 46 requires a company to consolidate a variable
interest entity if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity
even if the company does not have a majority of voting interests a variable
interest entity is generally defined as an entity where its equity is unable to
finance its activities or where the owners of the entity lack the risk and
rewards of ownership the provisions of this statement apply at inception for
any entity created after january 31 2003 for an entity created before february
1 2003 the provisions of this interpretation must be applied at the beginning
of the first interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2003 occidental
will adopt the provisions of fin no 46 in the third quarter of 2003 for
existing entities that are within the scope of this interpretation the
statement also has disclosure requirements some of which are required to be
disclosed for financial statements issued after january 31 2003 on a
preliminary basis occidental believes that its oxymar investment and its
laporte texas vcm plant lease will be consolidated under the provisions of this
statement see further discussion in additional considerations regarding
funding and liquidity in the mda

fin no 45
     in january 2003 the fasb issued fin no 45 guarantors accounting and
disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of
indebtedness of others fin no 45 requires a company to recognize a liability
for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee this liability
would be recorded at the inception of a guarantee and would be measured at fair
value the measurement provisions of this statement apply prospectively to
guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 the disclosure provisions
of the statement apply to financial statements for periods ending after december
15 2002 see further discussion in lawsuits claims commitments
contingencies and related matters in the mda occidental will adopt the
measurement provisions of this statement in the first quarter of 2003 the
adoption of the statement is not expected to have a material effect on the
financial statements when adopted

sfas no 148
     in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased
compensation  transition and disclosure sfas no 148 permits two additional
transition methods for companies that elect to adopt the fairvaluebased method
of accounting for stockbased employee compensation the statement also expands
the disclosure requirements for stockbased compensation the provisions of this
statement apply to financial statements for fiscal years ending after december
15 2002 the statement is not expected to have a material impact on the
financial statements when adopted

sfas no 146
     in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 146 requires that a
liability be recognized for exit and disposal costs only when the liability has
been incurred and when it can be measured at fair value the statement is
effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december 31
2002 occidental will adopt sfas no 146 in the first quarter of 2003 and it is
not expected to have a material impact on its financial statements

sfas no 145
     in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 rescission of fasb statements
no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical
corrections in addition to amending or rescinding other existing authoritative
pronouncements to make various technical corrections clarify meanings or
describe their applicability under changed conditions sfas no 145 precludes
companies from recording gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt as an
extraordinary item occidental implemented sfas no 145 in the fourth quarter of
2002 and all comparative financial statements have been reclassified to conform
to the 2002 presentation since occidental had no 2002 extraordinary items
there was no effect on the 2002 presentation the effects of the statement on
prior years include the reclassification of an extraordinary loss to net income
from continuing operations of 8 million 002 per share in 2001 and of 1
million no per share effect in 2000 there was no effect on net income or
basic earnings per common share upon adoption

sfas no 144
     in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets and
broadens the presentation of discontinued operations for longlived assets the
provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 occidental adopted this
statement in the first quarter of 2002 and it did not have an impact on the
financial statements when adopted

sfas no 143
     in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset
retirement obligations sfas no 143 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived
assets and the associated asset retirement costs occidentals current policy
for dismantlement restoration and reclamation costs is to accrue the estimated
future abandonment and removal costs of offshore production platforms net of
salvage value over their operating lives for onshore oil and gas production
occidental estimates that the salvage value of the oil and


                                       31
page


gas properties generally will approximate the dismantlement restoration and
reclamation costs or that the net cost will not be material therefore no
accrual is recorded occidental makes capital renewal expenditures for its
chemical plants on a continual basis while an asset is in operation thus
retirement obligations are provided for when a decision is made to dispose of a
property or when operations have been curtailed on other than a temporary basis
under sfas no 143 companies are required to recognize the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the
liability is incurred if there is a legal obligation to dismantle the asset and
reclaim or remediate the property at the end of the useful life occidental will
adopt sfas no 143 in the first quarter of 2003 the initial adoption is
expected to result in an aftertax charge of 50  60 million which will be
recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles the
adoption is also expected to increase net property plant and equipment by 59
million increase asset retirement obligation by 150 million and decrease
deferred tax liabilities by 33 million in addition occidental will record a
pretax charge to income of approximately 17 million a year to reflect the
accretion of the liability and higher depreciation expense beginning in 2003

sfas no 142
     in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets sfas no 142 changes the accounting and reporting requirements for
acquired goodwill and intangible assets the provisions of this statement must
be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 at
december 31 2001 the balance sheet included approximately 108 million of
goodwill and intangible assets with annual amortization expense of approximately
6 million recorded in each of the years income statements for the threeyear
period ended december 31 2001 as a result elimination of goodwill
amortization would not have had a material impact on net income or earnings per
share of any of the years presented and as a result the transitional
disclosures of adjusted net income excluding goodwill amortization described by
sfas no 142 have not been presented upon implementation of sfas no 142 in the
first quarter of 2002 three separate specialty chemical businesses were
identified as separate reporting units and tested for goodwill impairment all
three of these businesses are components of the chemical segment and were the
only reporting units having any goodwill on the balance sheet the fair value of
each of the three reporting units was determined through third party appraisals
the appraisals determined fair value to be the price that the assets could be
sold for in a current transaction between willing parties as a result of the
impairment testing occidental recorded a cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principles aftertax reduction in net income of approximately 95
million due to the impairment of all the goodwill attributed to these reporting
units occidental now has no remaining goodwill on its financial statements

sfas no 141
     in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 141 business combinations sfas
no 141 establishes new standards for accounting and reporting business
combinations including eliminating the pooling method of accounting the
standard applies to all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001
occidental implemented the provisions of sfas no 141 which had no impact on
the financial statements

sfas no 133
     on january 1 2001 occidental adopted sfas no 133 as amended these
statements established accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and hedging activities and required an entity to recognize all
derivatives in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments
at fair value changes in the derivative instruments fair value must be
recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met
adoption of these new accounting standards resulted in cumulative aftertax
reductions in net income of approximately 24 million and oci of approximately
27 million in the first quarter of 2001 the adoption also increased total
assets by 588 million and total liabilities by 639 million as of january 1
2001

eitf issue no 0010
     in the fourth quarter of 2000 occidental adopted the provisions of eitf

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations incorporating item 7a

2001 business environment
     in this report the term occidental refers to occidental petroleum
corporation andor one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting
interest subsidiaries occidental is divided into two major operating
businesses

oil and natural gas industry
     the market price of west texas intermediate wti declined considerably
during 2001 falling from around 30bbl in january to less than 20bbl in
december the fourth quarter was the weakest for oil prices since the third
quarter of 1999 overall the crude oil market continued to indicate both
longterm and shortterm price uncertainty
     nymex domestic natural gas prices were subject to greater volatility in
2001 natural gas prices which were over 5thousand cubic feet mcf in the
fourth quarter of 2000 rose to 7mcf in the first quarter of 2001 and then
declined significantly to less than 3mcf by yearend increased supply from
heavy investment in drilling by the industry in 2000 and 2001 higher
inventories and decreased demand combined to lower gas prices back to the level
last seen in the first quarter of 2000
     the number of us onshore rigs in use climbed from under 500 in mid1999
to over 1100 in mid2001 but the decline in oil and gas prices resulted in
fewer than 800 rigs in use by the end of the year

chemical industry
     the chemical industry experienced a significant decrease in demand as the
decadelong us economic expansion gave way to a recession in march 2001
following a slowdown that began midway through 2000 due to a pessimistic
outlook and no nearterm signs of economic recovery customers and distributors
continued with inventory reduction and limited purchases most asian european
and south american countries also experienced an economic downturn similar to
north american trends recordhigh energy prices and feedstock costs began to
drop in the second quarter but poor product demand for the year resulted in
overall weaker prices and profit margins

     domestic chlorine demand decreased significantly in 2001 compared with
2000 due to poor demand for chlorine derivatives including vinyls polyurethane
chemicals epichlorohydrin and others which are primarily used in durable goods
and consumer products the poor chlorine demand resulted in chlorine prices
declining throughout the year caustic soda prices peaked in the first half of
the year due to major cutbacks in chlorine production demand was stable in the
first half of the year but began to soften in the third quarter polyvinyl
chloride pvc prices but not margins improved for a short time reflecting
higher energy and feedstock prices during the first few months before reaching a
peak in april but weakened throughout the remainder of the year due to poor
demand and increased industry capacity

strategic overview and review of business results  1999  2001

strategy
     occidentals overall strategy to add value for shareholders consists of
three basic elements

   shift corporate assets to large longlived oil and gas assets with growth
     potential
   maintain financial discipline and strengthen the balance sheet
   harvest cash from chemicals

     implementation of this strategy included divesting interests in the natural
gas pipeline segment and buying large legacy oil and gas assets in california
and texas that are expected to provide stable production strong earnings and
cash flow and a solid platform for new growth initiatives

     at occidental financial discipline means prudently investing capital in
projects that are expected to produce superior returns while strengthening the
balance sheet to reduce both risk and earnings volatility

     the chemicals business is being used to provide free cash flow

specific actions
oil and gas
     the oil and gas business strategy has three parts that together are
focused on adding new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace well ahead of
production while simultaneously keeping finding and development costs among the
lowest in the industry

   continue to add commercial reserves in and around core areas in the us
     middle east and latin america through a combination of focused exploration
     and development programs

   pursue commercial opportunities with host governments in core areas to
     enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining
     oil in place by applying appropriate technology and innovative
     reservoirmanagement practices

   maintain a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive
     prices

     occidentals oil and gas business is currently concentrated in five us
states and nine foreign countries
     the asset mix within each of these areas has been strengthened by the sale
of properties with low or no current return and investment in assets with much
higher performance potential the results of these changes are discussed below
in business review  oil  gas

chemical
     occidental conducts its chemical operations through occidental chemical
corporation and its various subsidiaries and affiliates collectively oxychem
oxychem focuses on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with ethylene and
chlorine which is coproduced with caustic soda and converts them through a
series of intermediate products into pvc in order to strengthen its position
along the chlorovinyls chain occidental entered into a major business alliance
in 1999 a vinyls partnership with geon now known as polyone named oxyvinyls
lp oxyvinyls

corporate
     in july 2001 occidental sold its interests in a subsidiary that owned a
texas intrastate pipeline and its interest in a liquefied natural gas lng
project in indonesia aftertax proceeds of approximately 750 million from
these transactions were used to reduce debt
     in april 2000 occidental sold its interest in canadian occidental
petroleum ltd renamed nexen inc canadianoxy or nexen aftertax proceeds
together with tax benefits from the disposition of oilproducing properties in
peru totaling 700 million were used to reduce debt following the altura
acquisition
     occidental received 775 million from chevron in a litigation settlement in
november 1999 which was used mainly to reduce highcost debt

the largest source of gas in california the elk hills acquisition was followed
in april 2000 by the purchases of altura energy in texas for 36 billion and
the much smaller thums property in long beach for 110 million
     at the end of 2001 these three assets made up 65 percent of occidentals
worldwide proven oil reserves and 52 percent of its proven gas reserves on a
barrel of oil equivalent boe basis they accounted for 63 percent of worldwide
reserves in 2001 the combined production from these assets averaged
approximately 266000 boe per day which represents 56 percent of occidentals
total worldwide production

altura acquisition
     occidental completed the acquisition of the altura properties on april 19
2000 in the relatively short period since the acquisition the altura
properties have generated nearly 12 billion in operating cash flow after
capital expenditures of approximately 350 million
     net production averaged 140000 boe per day in 2001
     the altura properties were successfully integrated with occidentals
existing permian operations making occidental the largest oil producer in
texas
     with the altura acquisition occidental has become a world leader in carbon
dioxide co2 flood technology an enhanced oil recovery technique that involves
injecting co2 into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent causing the oil to
flow more freely so it can be pumped to the surface currently occidentals co2
floods provide about half of its oil production in the permian basin

milne point  bravo dome swap
     in late 2000 occidental swapped its 9percent interest in the milne point
oil field in alaska operated by bp plc bp for bps 75percent working
interest in the bravo dome co2 unit in northern new mexico bravo dome co2
production averaged approximately 320 million cubic feet per day in 2001
     because of thirdparty sales commitments bravo dome currently meets
approximately onethird of occidentals co2 demand in the permian basin

thums
     at yearend 2001 net production from the thums oil property in long beach
ca was averaging 30000 barrels per day an increase from approximately 25000
barrels per day at the end of 2000
     in december 2001 work began on a 3d vertical seismic profile survey
which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2002 the results of
this survey are expected to assist in planning for the future development of the
properties
     occidental plans to build a 45megawatt gasfired power plant to enhance
thums value since production at thums depends on electric submersible pumps
electricity is the single largest component of this operations cost structure
moreover the supply of electricity is interruptible meaning that when power is
in short supply service may be interrupted to accommodate other users such as
domestic households the new power plant will allow thums to generate its own
secure supply of electricity from its untapped natural gas resources while
simultaneously lowering operating costs any excess electricity can be sold back
to the local electricity grid the permitting process and preconstruction
activities are progressing well and construction is expected to commence in the
first half of 2002

gulf of mexico
     in july 2000 occidental monetized its interests on the continental shelf
in the gulf of mexico gom and the proceeds were used to reduce debt also
refer to acquisitions dispositions and commitments  2000 for further
information
     the development in the gom is currently focused on the deep water horn
mountain oil discovery in which occidental has a onethird interest and bp is
the operator the discovery well which was drilled to a depth of nearly 14000
feet is located about 60 miles off the louisianamississippi coast in 5400
feet of water

     gross proved reserves exceed 100 million boe with production scheduled to
begin late in 2002 production is expected to peak in 2003 with occidentals
peak share estimated at 21000 boe per day

elk hills
     as a result of sustained capital investment production increased in 2001
to approximately 99000 boe per day from approximately 96000 boe per day in
1999 and 2000 elk hills has generated total free cash flow after capital
expenditures of approximately 24 billion since occidental acquired the asset
in early 1998
     since the date of acquisition occidental has replaced 108 percent of its
total elk hills oil and gas production of 136 million boe at the end of 2001
the property still had an estimated 437 million boe of proved reserves compared
to the 425 million boe that were recorded at the time of the acquisition

middle east
oman
     occidentals oman business centers on its 300million barrel discovery in
block 9 occidental has produced more than 150 million gross barrels from the
block most of it from the safah field
     net production to occidental averaged 14000 barrels of oil per day in the
fourth quarter and occidental expects to expand its oman business over the next
few years
     occidental uses multilateral horizontal wells to increase production and
recovery rates and to minimize the number of wells needed today 60 percent of
occidentals production in oman relies on horizontal wells a new waterflood
program is currently under way at safah that will enhance production and improve
the ultimate recovery of reserves from the field

yemen
     in yemen occidentals net production averaged 33000 barrels of oil per
day in 2001 with 29000 coming from the masila field and the remainder from
east shabwa a series of stepout wells are planned for masila in 2002 that are
expected to add new reserves
     in 2001 occidental completed a 3d seismic program in block 20
preliminary analysis of these data was completed and plans are under way to
begin drilling two exploratory wells in block 20 in late 2002 in addition a
3d seismic program is beginning in the first quarter of 2002 in block 44
analysis of seismic data for block 59 which is part of the underexplored
southern portion of the rub al khali desert has been completed and a test well
began drilling in january 2002

qatar
     in qatar occidental successfully reversed 25 years of declining production
in the idd el shargi north dome field by introducing advanced drilling systems
and by applying new waterflooding and reservoir characterization techniques
gross production increased from 20000 barrels per day to more than 100000
barrels per day peaking at 138000 barrels in 1998
     occidental is developing the south dome field as a satellite to the north
dome which reduces the overall capital requirement of the two projects
combined production from the two fields in the fourth quarter of 2001 was 43000
barrels per day net to occidental
     occidental also has implemented a waterflood program in the north domes
shuaiba reservoir and is currently evaluating a secondgeneration redevelopment
project
     occidental is also pursuing new exploration opportunities in qatar

saudi arabia
     in saudi arabia occidental has a 20percent interest in the core venture
two consortium which expects to invest in the red sea area to help the kingdom
identify and develop new natural gas reserves for the domestic market
     the red sea venture currently consists of development of discovered gas
from the midyan and barqan fields in the northwest part of the kingdom and
construction of related gasprocessing and pipeline facilities the consortium
expects to build at least one power plant and possibly a waterdesalination unit
and will also evaluate the potential for a petrochemical plant
     the project also calls for onshore and offshore exploration in blocks 40 to
49 located in and along the red sea exploration success in these blocks will
lay the foundation for additional investment opportunities in power generation
water desalination and petrochemicals in the western part of the kingdom
     an initial agreement was signed with the kingdom on june 3 2001 final
agreements are currently expected to be signed in 2002

other eastern hemisphere
pakistan
     occidental holds oil and gas interests in the badin blocks in pakistan
which bp operates current gross production is 65000 boe per day occidentals
net share is approximately 16000 boe per day
     current plans call for drilling 13 to 15 wells per year to develop new and
existing fields by the end of 2003 and occidental continues to evaluate
additional exploration opportunities

russia
     in russia occidentals 50percent joint venture company vanyoganneft
produced approximately 28000 boe net to occidental in the fourth quarter of
2001

indonesia
     in july 2001 occidental sold its interest in the tangguh lng project in
indonesia which was in its initial phase of development to mitsubishi
corporation of japan for a sale price of 480 million the proceeds were used in
occidentals debtreduction program

latin america
colombia
     in 2001 production from occidentals cano limon operations in colombia was
substantially reduced from 2000 and 1999 levels due to a record number of
attacks by local leftwing terrorist groups on the pipeline which is operated
by ecopetrol nevertheless occidentals net share of 2001 production averaged
18000 barrels of oil per day and this operation continues to be profitable
this operation accounts for less than one percent of occidentals worldwide
assets and only three percent of total worldwide reserves and four percent of
worldwide oil and gas production at yearend 2001 occidental presently
anticipates that it will recover the proved reserves attributable to its
contract the potential rewards are significant when the pipeline is fully
operational
     the gibraltar exploration well which was drilled approximately 100 miles
west of cano limon did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and
the 66 million cost of the well was written off in 2001

ecuador
     in 2000 occidental farmed out a 40percent economic interest in block 15
in ecuador to alberta energy company ltd aec this transaction reduced
occidentals exposure in ecuador and is expected to largely fund its capital
program incountry through 2004
     gross production in block 15 is currently flat with 2001 average production
of approximately 30000 barrels of oil per day with 13000 barrels net to
occidental
     occidental has begun development of the edenyuturi oil field in the
southeastern corner of block 15 the startup of production is scheduled to
coincide with the completion of the oleoducto de crudos pesados ocp ltd
heavyoil pipeline in 2003 in addition work is being carried out in the
western portion of the block in and around fields currently in production the
combined effect of these projects is expected to add net incremental production
of 30000 barrels per day to occidentals production profile
     in addition occidental is expanding its exploration activities in block 15
with an aggressive 3d seismic program
     foreign oil companies including occidental have been paying value added
tax vat generally calculated on the basis of 1012 percent of expenditures
for goods and services used in the production of oil for export until 2001
these vat payments were reimbursed to the oil companies because they are
incurred for the production of an export product in 2001 the ecuador tax
authority announced that these vat payments do not qualify for reimbursement in
response the affected oil companies filed actions in the ecuador tax court to
seek a judicial determination that the expenditures are subject to
reimbursement occidental believes that it has a valid claim for reimbursement
under applicable ecuador tax law and historic precedent

business review  chemical
     although industry volumes improved in early 2001 following weak secondhalf
2000 demand pvc resin sales in north america lagged 2000 levels by 8 percent
through june 2001 overall demand declined 26 percent from 2000 to 2001
significant oversupply of pvc resin combined with continued inventory reductions
by customers resulted in north american pvc industry operating rates of around
80 percent in 2001 versus 85 percent in 2000
     pvc resin prices increased only slightly in the first half of 2001 but
declined throughout the remainder of the year higher exports in 2001 prevented
operating rates from falling lower but export sales returned only minimal
margins
     on june 1 2001 oxychem temporarily idled its ingleside tx ethylene
dichloride edc plant and on december 27 2001 oxychem temporarily idled the
deer park chloralkali plant in houston tx due to a combination of
deteriorating prices and weak demand these facilities will remain idle until
economic conditions improve
     in occidentals chloralkali business reduced demand for chlorine led to
significantly reduced operating rates oxychems operating rate as a percent of
capacity fell from 92 percent in 2000 to 84 percent in 2001 the chlorine
industrys 2001 operating rate was 85 percent compared to 92 percent for 2000
despite reduced liquid caustic production caustic prices declined in the second
half of the year on weak demand as 2001 progressed chlorine prices fell due to
declining demand especially in the global vinyls market operations at the
convent chloralkali and edc plant which had been curtailed were recommenced
in 2001
     recordhigh energy costs in the first quarter of 2001 adversely affected
earnings for the total year energy costs were higher than 2000 but well below
first quarter levels feedstock costs followed the same trend as energy costs
     petrochemical margins were under pressure throughout 2001 due to weak
demand and significant capacity additions by basfatofina formosa plastics and
union carbidenova chemical lower feedstock costs in the fourth quarter were
offset by lower prices due to continued weak demand
     the primary goal of occidentals chemical business is to provide free cash
flow from 1995 through 2001 total cash flow from the chemicals business was
38 billion including asset sales net of acquisitions of 10 billion

2002 outlook
oil and gas
     the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant
volatility due to numerous market forces crude oil and natural gas prices are
affected by market fundamentals such as weather inventory levels competing
fuel prices overall demand and the availability of supply


                                       16
page

     in the fourth quarter of 2001 worldwide oil prices weakened considerably
and have remained lower than their tenyear averages in the first quarter of
2002 sustained low prices will significantly impact profitability and returns
for occidental and other upstream producers however the industry has
historically experienced wide fluctuations within price cycles
     while fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting crude oil prices over
the long term daytoday prices may be more volatile in the futures markets
such as on the nymex and other exchanges which make it difficult to accurately
predict oil and natural gas prices in the short term other factors such as
weather patterns do have a significant effect particularly on natural gas
prices in the united states increased gas supplies from large capital
investment over the past year combined with a later winter resulted in
inventory levels at the end of 2001 exceeding the average of the preceding five
years by 20 percent
     the combination of higher gas supplies and lower demand which is
continuing into the first quarter of 2002 is expected to result in
significantly lower average gas price realizations for occidental in 2002 than
in 2001

chemical
     the performance of the chemical business is difficult to forecast but this
business is capable of contributing significant earnings and cash flow when
demand is strong
     industry operating rates in the chloralkalivinyls business are expected
to recover gradually in 2002

chloralkali
     domestic chlorine demand is expected to increase by nearly 2 percent in
2002 which should allow the industrys operating rates to improve in the
absence of capacity additions liquid caustic pricing is expected to continue to
be weak
     the domestic chlorine market price is expected to improve gradually
throughout 2002 as the vinyls demand for chlorine increases liquid caustic
pricing peaked in the second quarter of 2001 and is expected to decline through
the second quarter of 2002 in late 2001 oxychem temporarily idled its deer
park tx chloralkali facility until economic conditions improve

vinyls
     while the beginning of a weak recovery is expected in the second half of
2002 continued supplydemand imbalances in pvc markets will likely prevent all
but seasonal product price increases continued pressure on raw materials
particularly ethylene should result in relatively stable albeit low price
spreads over raw materials
     overall north american pvc growth is expected to average only 26 percent
in 2002 reflecting weak consumer confidence and low gdp growth while pvc will
continue to make inroads into new markets the highvolume construction and
automotive end markets for pvc products will likely remain well below peak
demand levels north american pvc industry operating rates are expected to
average between 8085 percent for the year

petrochemicals equistar partnership
     in january 2002 occidental and lyondell chemical company lyondell
agreed in principle for occidental to sell its share of equistar to lyondell
and to purchase an equity interest of approximately 21 percent in lyondell
these transactions are subject to the execution of definitive documents and
corporate and regulatory approvals in connection with the agreement in
principle occidental wrote down its investment in the equistar partnership by
240 million after tax in december 2001 occidental will continue to reflect
its share of equistars results until the transaction closes which is expected
in the second quarter of 2002

income summary
     occidental reported net income of 12 billion 310 per share in 2001
on net sales of 140 billion compared with net income of 16 billion 426

     earnings before special items in 2001 were 244 billion compared with
240 billion in 2000 the increase in earnings before special items reflected
primarily the impact of higher natural gas prices and higher production volumes
partially offset by lower worldwide crude oil prices and higher exploration
expense
     approximately 54 percent of oil and gas sales revenues for 2001 were
attributable to oil and gas trading activity compared with approximately 50
percent in 2000 and 43 percent in 1999 these trading activities focus on
obtaining the highest sale price available occidental also occasionally engages
in hedging activities for relatively small parts of its total production to
reduce exposure to price risk thereby mitigating cashflow volatility refer to
derivative and hedging activities for a complete discussion other than the
positive effect on oil and gas realized prices the results of trading
activities are not significant
     the increase in oil and gas trading revenues from 2000 to 2001 was due to a
14percent increase in the volume of oil and gas trades and a 49percent
increase in gas prices the revenue was also positively affected by an increase
in the volume of natural gas liquids ngls although this impact was not
significant these positive effects were partially offset by an 18percent
decrease in oil prices associated with the trading contracts

     the lower balance in trade receivables at december 31 2001 compared with
december 31 2000 reflected lower product prices during the fourth quarter of
2001 versus 2000 the decrease in receivables from joint ventures partnerships
and other was due to lower marktomarket adjustments on derivative financial
instruments in the oil and gas trading group the lower balance in equity
investments primarily reflected the writedown of the equity investment in
equistar in december 2001 the decrease in the net balance in property plant
and equipment reflected depreciation depletion and amortization and the sale of
the entity that owns pipelines in texas offset in part by capital spending
     the decrease in current maturities of longterm debt reflected a
reclassification of the current portion of longterm debt since it is
managements intention to refinance the amount on a longterm basis by issuing
longterm debt the decrease in accounts payable was due to lower trade payable
balances in the oil and gas marketing and trading operations the decrease in
accrued liabilities was due to lower marktomarket adjustments on derivative
financial instruments in the oil and gas trading group a lower accrual for
interest expense and other miscellaneous items the increase in longterm debt
primarily reflected the 800 million senior notes that were issued in 2001
mainly to extinguish the nonrecourse debt which was originally incurred as a
result of the altura acquisition the nonrecourse debt was extinguished in 2001
using free operating cash flow and seniornote proceeds the longterm balance
of the obligations under the natural gas delivery commitment decreased from
december 31 2000 which reflected the reduction in the overall amount of the
obligation other deferred credits and liabilities included deferred
compensation primarily other postretirement benefits environmental reserves
contract advances deferred revenue and other deferred items the decrease in
this account was primarily the result of the decrease in deferred revenue from
the gom monetization the increase in stockholders equity primarily reflected
net income partially offset by dividends on common stock

commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations and proceeds from
existing credit facilities as necessary

derivative and hedging activities
general
     occidentals marketrisk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices
and to a lesser extent interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates
occidentals results are sensitive mainly to crude oil and natural gas prices
and fluctuations in those prices have an impact on occidentals results based
on current levels of production if oil prices vary overall by 1 per barrel
they would have approximately a 108 million annual affect before us income
tax if natural gas prices vary by 025 per million btu mmbtu they would
have approximately a 60 million annual effect before us income tax if
production levels change in the future the sensitivity of occidentals results
to oil and gas prices also would change occidental may periodically use
different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and
gas to reduce its exposure to price volatility and thus mitigate fluctuations
in commodityrelated cash flows usually occidental remains unhedged to
longterm oil and gas prices overall occidentals use of derivatives in
hedging activity remains at a relatively low level however current rules
require extensive disclosure regarding any level of derivative use the
following disclosures describe each area of occidentals derivative activity in
detail
     effective january 1 1999 occidental adopted the provisions of emerging
issues task force eitf issue no 9810 accounting for contracts involved in
energy trading and risk management activities which establishes accounting and
reporting standards for certain energy trading contracts eitf 9810 requires
that energy trading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses
included in earnings and separately disclosed in the financial statements or
accompanying footnotes the initial adoption of eitf 9810 resulted in a first
quarter noncash aftertax benefit of 2 million recorded as a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle in 1999
     effective january 1 2001 occidental adopted the provisions of statement
of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 137 and sfas no 138
collectively sfas no 133 as amended these statements establish accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and
require an entity to recognize all derivatives in the statement of financial
position and measure those instruments at fair value unless the instrument
qualifies as a normal purchase or sale contract changes in the derivative
instruments fair value must be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge
accounting criteria are met changes in the fair value of derivative instruments
that meet specific cashflow hedge accounting criteria are reported in other
comprehensive income oci the gains and losses on cashflow hedge transactions
that are reported in oci are reclassified to earnings in the periods in which
earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item
gains and losses from derivatives that qualify for fairvalue hedge accounting
are recorded in earnings along with the change in fair value of the hedged item
the ineffective portions of all hedges are recognized in current period
earnings prior to the adoption of sfas no 133 gains and losses on commodity
futures contracts that qualified for hedge accounting essentially those
associated with equity production or purchases were deferred until recognized
as an adjustment to sales revenue or purchase costs when the related transaction
being hedged was finalized
     occidentals initial adoption of sfas no 133 as amended resulted in a
first quarter aftertax reduction in net income of 24 million recorded as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles and an aftertax
reduction in oci of approximately 27 million the adoption also increased total
assets by 588 million and total liabilities by 639 million as of january 1
2001

commodity price derivatives
general
     with respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations
occidental used a combination of futures options and swaps to offset various
open price positions
     the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted
market prices dealer quotes or synthetic price curves established from quoted
prices adjusted for time location and quality differentials

cashflow commodity hedges
     occidental used cashflow hedges for the sale of crude oil and natural gas
in 2001 with the objective of mitigating price risk arising from fluctuating
values for


                                       27
page

these commodities crude oil hedges were executed for occidentals west texas
production its strategy to achieve these objectives included a combination of
purchased put options and written call options resulting in no net premium
received for crude oil hedging purchased put options were used for natural gas
hedging and were executed for the midcontinent production area to establish a
minimum sales price for its production occidental used no fairvalue hedges for
crude oil or natural gas production during 2001
     occidentals cashflowhedging instruments which consist of natural gas
put option contracts are highly effective during 2001 net gains of 06
million were recorded to oci relating to changes in current cashflow hedges and
net losses of 76 million were reclassified from oci into earnings as a
reduction to net sales revenue as the forecasted transactions actually
occurred the fair value at december 31 2001 of derivative financial
instruments that have been designated and have qualified as cashflowhedging
instruments was 02 million the gain was recorded as an increase to oci and
will be reclassified into earnings during 2002 when the forecasted transactions
actually occur

marketing and trading operations

    the fair value at december 31 2001 of derivative instruments used in
marketing and trading operations is a net gain of 9 million gains of 24
million were recorded in earnings due to the change in fair value of these
financial derivative instruments during 2001 offsetting the value of these
instruments are related physical positions with a fair value of 2 million loss
at december 31 2001 gains of 15 million were recorded in earnings due to the
change in the fair value of related physical positions during 2001 the net
positions mostly expire in 2002 additionally a longterm sales contract volume
commitment is 38100 mmbtu per day through october 2010 the approximate 39
million net gain from the change in fair value during 2001 of derivative
instruments used in marketing and trading operations was reflected in the income
statement the 39 million net gain represents a reversal of negative
marktomarket adjustments resulting from the adoption of sfas no 133 as
amended
     at december 31 2001 total assets and liabilities include 108 million and
101 million for the fair value of derivative instruments used in marketing and
trading operations

     prior to the physical settlement of any energy contract held for trading
purposes favorable or unfavorable price movement is reported in the income
statement an offsetting amount is recorded on the balance sheet as unrealized
gains or unrealized losses on trading transactions when a contract to sell
energy is physically settled the above entries are reversed and the gross
amount invoiced to the customer is included as net sales in the income
statement similarly when a contract to purchase energy is physically settled
the purchase price is included as cost of sales in the income statement until a
contract is physically settled the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified to a
receivable or payable account other than the positive effect on oil and gas
realized prices the results of trading activities are not significant

gas presale
     in november 1998 occidental entered into a natural gas delivery commitment
for proceeds of 500 million which obligates occidental to deliver 263 billion
cubic feet of natural gas over a fouryear period ending in december 2003 this
transaction resulted in less expensive financing and enables occidental to
satisfy the delivery commitment at a fixed price with open market purchases
without reducing its own natural gas reserves the imputed interest rate in the
transaction is approximately 6 percent the current portion of occidentals
natural gas delivery commitment 137 million at december 31 2001 is shown as
a current liability on occidentals consolidated balance sheets the present
value of the noncurrent commitment 145 million at december 31 2001 is shown
under deferred credits and other liabilities on occidentals consolidated
balance sheets in connection with this transaction occidental simultaneously
entered into a natural gas price swap based on identical volumes of natural gas
and a delivery schedule that corresponds to the natural gas delivery commitment
under the terms of the swap occidental will pay an average fixed price of 227
per mmbtu of gas and will receive a floating price that will approximate market
which essentially eliminates occidentals exposure to commodity price
fluctuations that could affect this transaction at december 31 2001 the fair
value of this price swap is an 84 million gain which is offset by an 84
million loss applicable to the related physical positions

activities prior to sfas 133 implementation
     at december 31 2000 occidental was a party to commodityexchange and
overthecounter forward obligations the instruments held for purposes other
than trading expire during the period from january 2001 to december 2003 and
relate to the hedging of natural gas and crude oil prices the fair value of
these instruments at december 31 2000 was 511 million offsetting the value of
these instruments were related physical positions with a 528 million loss the
principal components of these instruments and related physical positions are the
related natural gas price swap and the natural gas delivery commitment which is
discussed above at december 31 2000 the difference between the carrying value
and the fair value of these obligations was an unrealized loss of approximately
17 million the instruments held or issued for trading purposes mostly expired
in 2001 with the exception of a longterm sales contract that expires in 2010
the fair value of these instruments at december 31 2000 was 31 million
offsetting the value of these instruments were related physical positions with a
12 million loss the net gain of approximately 19 million was reflected in the
income statement the majority of the gain was from the marktomarket
adjustment under eitf issue no 9810 of a longterm sales contract

interestrate derivatives
fairvalue hedges
     interestrate swaps forward locks and futures contracts are entered into
as part of occidentals overall strategy to manage interestrate exposure
during 2001 occidental entered into several interestrate swaps that qualified
for fairvalue hedge accounting these derivatives effectively convert
approximately 13 billion of fixedrate debt to variablerate debt with
maturities ranging from 2005 to 2008 in 2000 and 1999 occidental also had
interestrate swaps converting fixedrate debt to floatingrate debt that
matured in november 2000 net interest expense was impacted by 66 million of
income in 2001 10 million of expense in 2000 and income of almost 10
million in 1999 to reflect the effects of the fairvalue hedges

cashflow hedges
     occidental is a party to a series of forward interestrate locks which
qualified as a cashflow hedge that are required to be settled on or prior to
december 31 2002 these financial instruments relate to debt raised by a third
party to construct a cogeneration plant that will be subject to a longterm
operating lease to oxychem as the lease payments will be directly related to
the amount of interest paid on the underlying debt the forward rate locks were
put in place to hedge the future lease payments the lease payments are expected
to commence on or before january 15 2003 the fair value of these financial
instruments at december 31 2001 was an unrealized loss of 28 million that
would be offset by potentially lower lease payments due to the lower
interestrate environment
     occidental and its equity investees have also entered into additional
derivative instruments that qualified as cashflow hedges the amounts related
to these hedges are included below
     for the year ended 2001 a 4 million gain was reclassified from oci to
income due to the expiration of cashflow hedges and a 3 million loss was
recorded to oci relating to changes in current cashflow hedges during the next
twelve months occidental expects that less than about 01 million of net
derivative losses included in oci based on their valuation at december 31
2001 will be reclassified into earnings hedge ineffectiveness did not have a
significant impact on earnings for the year

foreign currency derivatives
     many of occidentals foreign oil and gas operations and foreign chemical
operations are located in countries whose currencies generally depreciate
against the us dollar on a continuing basis generally an effective currency
forward market does not exist for these countries therefore occidental
attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and
liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for
operating purposes additionally all of occidentals oil and gas foreign
entities have the us dollar as the functional currency since the cash flows
are mainly denominated in us dollars however in one foreign chemical
subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency occidental has
exposure on debt that is denominated in us dollars that is not material at
december 31 2001 and 2000 occidental had not entered into any foreign currency
derivative instruments the effect of exchangerate transactions in foreign
currencies is included in periodic income

credit risk
     occidentals derivative contracts are spread among numerous banks and
market leaders in the industry creditworthiness is reviewed before doing
business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis occidental monitors
aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits and manages
creditenhancement requirements such as collateral parental guarantees and
letters of credit credit limits for all customers whether financial or
physical are established and entered into occidentals riskmanagement systems
and these limits are monitored for compliance on an aggregated basis across all
traded commodities credit exposure for each customer is monitored for
outstanding balances current month activity and forward marktomarket
exposure the creditdetermination process takes into consideration the
creditworthiness of the counterparty the counterpartys parent parental
guarantees letters of credit and other creditenhancing instruments

taxes
     deferred tax liabilities were 989 million at december 31 2001 net of
deferred tax assets of 768 million the current portion of the deferred tax
assets of 114 million is included in prepaid expenses and other the net
deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income
and reversal of taxable temporary differences

lawsuits claims commitments contingencies and related matters
     occidental and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in
a substantial number of lawsuits claims and proceedings they have also been
named as potentially responsible parties prps in governmental proceedings
under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act
cercla and corresponding state acts these governmental proceedings seek
funding remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property
damage punitive damages and civil penalties aggregating substantial amounts
occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to
date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound
companies occidental has accrued reserves at the most likely cost to be
incurred in those proceedings where it is probable that occidental will incur
remediation costs which can be reasonably estimated
     during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by
taxing authorities for varying periods in various tax jurisdictions
     it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that
occidental and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits claims
and proceedings audits commitments contingencies and related matters several
of these matters may involve substantial amounts and if these were to be
ultimately resolved unfavorably to the full amount of their maximum potential
exposure an event not currently anticipated it is possible that such event
could have a material adverse effect upon occidentals consolidated financial
position or results of operations however in managements opinion after
taking into account reserves it is unlikely that any of the foregoing matters
will have a material adverse effect upon occidentals consolidated financial
position or results of operations

environmental expenditures
     occidentals operations in the united states are subject to stringent
federal state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or
maintaining the quality of the environment foreign operations also are subject
to environmentalprotection laws costs associated with environmental compliance
have increased over time and may continue to rise in the future environmental
expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall
business planning process these expenditures are mainly considered an integral
part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market
demand

environmental remediation
     the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply
retroactively to previous wastedisposal practices in many cases the laws
apply regardless of fault legality of the original activities or ownership or
control of sites occidental is currently participating in environmental
assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal cercla sites comparable
state sites and other remediation sites including occidental facilities and
previously owned sites also occidental and certain of its subsidiaries have
been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings
involving historical practices at various sites including in some instances
having been named as defendants andor as prps under the federal cercla law
these proceedings seek funding andor remediation and in some cases
compensation for alleged personal injury or property damage punitive damages
and civil penalties aggregating substantial amounts
     occidental does not consider the number of cercla and similar state sites
at which it has been notified that it has been identified as being involved to
be a relevant measure of exposure although the liability of a prp may be joint
and several occidental is usually one of many companies cited as a prp at these
sites and has to date been successful in sharing cleanup costs with other
financially sound companies also many of these sites are still under
investigation by the environmental protection agency epa or the equivalent
state agencies before actual cleanup the parties involved assess site
conditions and responsibility and determine the appropriate remedy the majority
of remediation costs are incurred after the parties obtain epa or equivalent
state agency approval to proceed the ultimate future cost of remediation of
certain of the sites for which occidental has been notified that it has been
identified as being involved cannot be reasonably determined at this time
     as of december 31 2001 occidental had been notified by the epa or
equivalent state agencies or otherwise had become aware that it had been
identified as being involved at 126 cercla or comparable state sites this
number does not include those sites where occidental has been successful in
resolving its involvement the 126 sites include 34 former diamond shamrock
chemical sites as to which maxus energy corporation has retained all liability
of the remaining 92 sites occidental has denied involvement at 9 sites and has
yet to determine involvement in 20 sites with respect to the remaining 63 of
these sites occidental is in various stages of evaluation and the extent of
liability retained by maxus energy corporation is disputed at 2 of these sites
for 54 of these sites where environmental


                                       30

remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated
occidental has accrued reserves at the most likely cost to be incurred the 54
sites include 11 sites as to which present information indicates that it is
probable that occidentals aggregate exposure is insignificant in determining
the reserves occidental uses the most current information available including
similar past experiences available technology regulations in effect the
timing of remediation and costsharing arrangements for the remaining 9 of the
63 sites being evaluated occidental does not have sufficient information to
determine a range of liability but occidental does have sufficient information
on which to base the opinion expressed above in the lawsuits claims

     operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis capital expenditures
relate to longlived improvements in currently operating facilities remediation
expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not
contribute to current or future revenue generation although total costs may
vary in any one year over the long term segment operating and capital
expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase
     occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly
owned subsidiary glenn springs holdings inc gsh gsh has full management
authority over all remediation sites and reports directly to occidentals
corporate management the environmental reserves as shown in the table above
have been provided for environmental remediation liabilities at the superfund
and comparable state sites discussed above and for resource conservation and
recovery act and other sites where occidental has environmental remediation
responsibility
     eight counties in the houstongalveston area are subject to a federal epa
mandate to adopt a plan for implementing certain requirements of the federal
clean air act known as a state implementation plan in october 2001 the epa
approved a state implementation plan for the houston galveston area the plan
the plan contains provisions requiring the reduction of 80  90 percent of
current nitrogen oxide nox emissions in the houstongalveston area by november
2007 occidental operates five facilities that will be subject to the plans
noxreduction requirements occidental estimates that its capital expenditures
will increase by between 80  120 million for environmental control and
monitoring equipment necessary to comply with the plans enacted or proposed
noxreduction requirements occidental began expending the capital necessary to
comply with the plan in 2001 and expects expenditures to end in 2007 although
the timing of the expenditures will vary by facility
     occidental presently estimates that divisional capital expenditures for
environmental compliance including the sip discussed above will be in the
range of 38 million for 2002 and 46 million for 2003

foreign investments
     portions of occidentals assets outside north america are exposed to
political and economic risks occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to
mitigate its exposure against those risks at december 31 2001 the carrying
value of occidentals assets in countries outside north america aggregated
approximately 20 billion or approximately 11 percent of occidentals total
assets at that date of such assets approximately 13 billion was located in
the middle east approximately 502 million was located in latin america and
substantially all of the remainder were located in pakistan and russia

critical accounting policies
     generally accepted accounting principles require the use of management
judgments and estimates in addition to the rules and regulations established by
accounting pronouncements
     occidental has adopted a number of accounting policies the most important
of which are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements
summary of significant accounting policies occidental believes the most
critical accounting policy including judgments in its application that may
have an impact on occidentals financial statements relates to the accounting
for capitalized longterm assets the rates at which these assets are
depreciated or otherwise written off are subject to a number of judgments about
future events many of which are beyond managements control

     oil and gas properties are accounted for using the successfulefforts
method costs of acquiring proved and unproved properties costs of drilling
successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized annual lease
rentals and exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs and
exploratory dryhole costs are expensed as incurred depreciation and depletion
of oil and gas producing properties is determined principally by the
unitofproduction method and is based on estimated recoverable reserves these
reserves are subject to revision based upon actual performance as well as
changes in the price of oil and gas significantly higher or lower product
prices will lead to changes in the amount of reserves due to economic limits or
the effects of productionsharing contracts the process of estimation of
reserves is inherently judgmental especially during the early life of a field
estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change
partially due to factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and
inflation or deflation of oil field service costs thus occidentals
depreciation and depletion expense could change in the future at december 31
2001 the costs attributable to unproved properties were approximately 16
billion as shown in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements these
costs are not subject to depreciation or depletion on a current basis as
development work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven
capitalized cost of the properties will be subject to depreciation and
depletion if the development work were to be unsuccessful the capitalized cost
of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the
year in which the determination was made the rate at which these unproven
properties are written off therefore depends upon future exploration and
development activities as well as the product price environment occidental
believes its development and exploration efforts will result in the addition of
sufficient reserves to fully realize this investment in unproved properties
     chemical facilities are depreciated using either the unitofproduction
method or straightline method both based upon the estimated productive life of
the facilities occidental makes annual capital renewal expenditures for its
chemical plants on a continual basis while the plants are in operation
impairment reserves are provided when a decision is made to dispose of a
property or when operations have been curtailed on other than a temporary basis
judgments about the useful life of a chemical plant can change depending on a
number of factors such as sustained higher or lower energy prices
environmental regulations foreign competition and technological change thus
occidentals depreciation expense could be higher or lower depending on these
and other factors

additional accounting changes
     listed below are additional changes in accounting principles applicable to
occidental

sfas no 144
     in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas
no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas
no 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or
disposal of longlived assets the provisions of this statement are effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15
2001 occidental will adopt this statement in the first quarter of 2002 and it
is not expected to have an impact on the financial statements

sfas no 143
     in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset
retirement obligations sfas no143 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived
assets and the associated asset retirement costs the provisions of this
statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after june 15 2002 occidental must implement sfas no 143 in the
first quarter of 2003 and has not yet determined its impact on the financial
statements

sfas no 142
     in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets sfas no 142 changes the accounting and reporting requirements for
acquired goodwill and intangible assets the provisions of this statement must
be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 certain
transitional provisions of the statement can be implemented as late as the
fourth quarter of 2002 provided that the transitional effect if any is
recorded retroactive to the first quarter of 2002 at december 31 2001 the
balance sheet included approximately 108 million of goodwill and intangible
assets with annual amortization expense of approximately 6 million recorded in
the income statement occidental expects to implement sfas no 142 in the first
quarter of 2002 the adoption of this accounting standard is expected to result
in a cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles aftertax reduction
in net income of approximately 95 million due to the anticipated impairment of
the goodwill

sfas no 141
     in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 141 business combinations sfas
no 141 establishes new standards for accounting and reporting business
combinations including eliminating the pooling method of accounting the
standard applies to all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001

on the financial statements

issue no 0010 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs which
establishes accounting and reporting standards for the treatment of shipping and
handling costs among its provisions eitf issue no 0010 requires that
transportation costs that had been accounted for as deductions from revenues
should now be recorded as an expense the implementation of eitf issue no 0010
had no effect on net income all prioryear balances have been adjusted to
reflect this accounting change the transportation costs that have been removed
as deductions from revenues and included in cost of sales on occidentals
statements of operations totaled 245 million in 2000 and 210 million in 1999

sfas no 140
     in the fourth quarter of 2000 occidental adopted the disclosure provisions
of sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishments of liabilities  a replacement of fasb statement no 125 which
revises disclosure standards for asset securitizations and other financial asset
transfers sfas no 140 also contains provisions which revise certain criteria
for accounting for securitizations financialasset transfers and collateral
these accounting provisions were adopted by occidental on april 1 2001 the
implementation of all of the provisions of sfas no 140 did not have an impact
on occidentals consolidated financial positions or results of operations

sab no 101
     in december 1999 the securities and exchange commission issued staff
accounting bulletin sab no 101 revenue recognition in financial
statements sab no 101 summarizes the staffs views in applying generally
accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in the financial
statements the bulletin was effective in the fourth quarter of 2000 occidental
was in compliance with these standards accordingly the adoption of sab no 101
did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements

sop no 985
     effective january 1 1999 occidental adopted the provisions of american
institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop 985
reporting on the costs of startup activities which requires that costs of
startup activities including organizational costs be expensed as incurred
the initial application of the statement resulted in a charge to income for
costs of previously capitalized startup activities that have not yet been fully
amortized the initial adoption of sop 985 resulted in a first quarter noncash
aftertax charge of 15 million net of 8 million in taxes which has been
recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations incorporating item 7a

2000 business environment
oil and natural gas industry
     during 2000 west texas intermediate wti crude oil traded in a wide
range dipping briefly below 24bbl in april and above 37bbl in september
the highest prices were seen in the third and fourth quarter but they slipped
considerably in december ending the year at under 27bbl however average
crude oil prices for the year were slightly above 30bbl the highest annual
average since 1983 overall the crude oil market continues to indicate
uncertainty both in longterm direction and in shortterm price equilibrium
     nymex domestic natural gas prices were also volatile in 2000 ranging from
approximately 220thousand cubic feet mcf to 1000mcf natural gas
prices finished the year very strong with the fourth quarter averaging over
5mcf more than double the average prices in the first quarter a supply
shortage depleting inventories and an early winter all combined to raise gas
prices to record levels

chemical industry
     in the first half of 2000 the chemical industry experienced strong product
demand and overall economic growth but in the second half experienced a
slowdown in product demand that triggered significant inventory corrections
among customers and distributors in the second half of 2000 the us economy
started showing signs of softening in the housing auto and other consumer
products related industries also us exports of major commodities were
constrained as asia and latin america continued to struggle to improve domestic
demand the combination of high energy and feedstock costs and reduced product
demand decreased profit margins significantly
     domestic chlorine demand increased in 2000 over 1999 due to overall strong
chlorine demand in chemicals other than vinyls chlorine pricing improved in
the first quarter through the third quarter before falling as fourth quarter
demand dropped caustic soda prices declined through the first three quarters
due to oversupply but strengthened significantly in the fourth

quarter as supply became limited due to major cutbacks in chlorine production
polyvinyl chloride pvc prices continued to improve during the first half
before reaching a peak in june then prices weakened as a combination of poor
demand and inventory corrections took hold

strategic overview and review of business results  1998  2000

strategy
     occidentals strategy is unchanged since 1997 and consists of two basic
elements

o    shift corporate assets to large longlived oil and gas assets with growth
     potential

     occidental will continue to swap or sell marginal assets or assets that are
nearing the end of their economic life cycle and replace them with assets such
as altura and elk hills that give it critical mass in its core markets
     occidental also refocused its exploration and enhanced recovery programs to
concentrate primarily in the us the middle east and latin america

o    harvest cash from chemicals

     to invest in profitable growth opportunities and support debt reduction
occidental enhanced its position in core chemical product markets by entering
into strategic alliances that have resulted in cost saving synergies

specific actions
oil and gas
     in implementing its strategy occidental has significantly strengthened its
operations in the us middle east and latin america
     by concentrating on large assets in these core areas occidental has used
economies of scale to reduce operating costs and improve margins
     occidental has taken a series of steps since 1997 to improve overall
domestic oil and gas performance  beginning with the 1998 acquisition of the
elk hills field in california each action is discussed below in the business
review occidental also consolidated its operations by focusing on 5 states and
exiting 11 others occidental has interests in california kansas new mexico
oklahoma and texas with california and texas being the primary areas of focus
occidental is no longer active in alabama alaska arkansas colorado
louisiana mississippi montana north and south dakota utah and wyoming
     outside the us occidental reduced the number of countries in which it
was involved from 24 in 1997 to 10 in 2000 today occidental operates in
albania colombia ecuador indonesia oman pakistan peru qatar russia and
yemen occidental sold producing properties in venezuela the dutch north sea
and peru and exited angola china egypt gabon hungary ireland and vietnam
among others occidental also completed asset swaps that strengthened its
position in its core areas these are discussed below by individual country

chemicals
     in its chemicals business occidental focused on the chlorovinyls chain
where it takes ethylene and chlorine which is coproduced with caustic soda
and converts them through a series of intermediate products into pvc
additionally to strengthen its position along the chlorovinyls chain
occidental entered into two major business alliances in 1999 a vinyls
partnership with geon now known as polyone named oxy vinyls lp
oxyvinyls and in 1998 a petrochemicals investment in equistar chemicals lp
equistar

corporate
     occidental sold all the shares of midcon corp midcon its natural gas
transmission and marketing business and exchanged a related note for a total of
35 billion in january 1998 given the prospects for limited growth in its key
markets occidental concluded that midcon was a nonstrategic asset
     in addition occidental redeemed 15 million preferred shares in march 1998
which saved approximately 58 million annually in preferred stock dividend
costs
     occidental received 775 million from chevron in a litigation settlement in
november 1999 which was used mainly to reduce highcost debt
     in april 2000 occidental sold its interest in canadian occidental
petroleum ltd now renamed nexen inc canadianoxy or nexen aftertax
proceeds together with tax benefits from the disposition of the peru producing
properties totaled 700 million and were used in its debt reduction program
following the altura acquisition

business review  oil and gas
altura acquisition
     occidental completed the acquisition of the altura properties valued at
36 billion on april 19 2000 since the acquisition the altura properties
have generated approximately 674 million in operating cash flow after capital
expenditures
     net production averaged 142000 boe per day  7000 barrels per day more
than occidental initially projected
     the altura properties have been successfully integrated with occidentals
existing permian operations making occidental the largest oil producer in texas

occidentals permian basin
     occidentals portfolio of assets in the permian basin includes interests in
10 of the 50 largest fields ever discovered in the us and 8 of the 10 largest
fields in the permian basin these fields are expected to provide a steady base
of longlived production as well as an opportunity for expansion through
additional enhanced recovery operations
     with the altura acquisition occidental has become a world leader in co2
flood technology an enhanced oil recovery technique currently occidental has
more than 50 active co2 floods which provide about half of occidentals
production in the permian basin

milne point  bravo dome swap
     occidental recently swapped its 9 percent interest in the milne point field
in alaska operated by british petroleum bp for bps 75 percent working
interest in the bravo dome co2 unit in northern new mexico
     production of co2 at bravo dome is roughly equal to occidentals total co2
requirements in the permian basin because of thirdparty sales commitments
bravo dome currently meets approximately 50 percent of occidental permians co2
demand
     this transaction assures occidental of a longterm secure supply of co2 to
support the exploitation of its permian assets and enhances the value of its
altura investment

thums
     the purchase of the thums oil properties in long beach california
essentially offset production from the property occidental sold in peru thums
production generates significantly higher price realizations than the peru
operation and it has a much longer life at year end net production was
averaging 25000 barrels per day

gulf of mexico
     occidental monetized its interests on the continental shelf in the gulf of
mexico gom which would have required significant capital expenditures for
future development

elk hills acquisition
     elk hills has generated total free cash flow after capital expenditures
of approximately 127 billion since the acquisition beginning in 1999 the
first full year that occidental owned the field production has held steady at
approximately 96000 boe per day
     since the date of acquisition occidental has replaced 114 percent of its
total oil and gas production at elk hills
     additionally occidental has succeeded at driving down its costs at elk
hills since gas production in southern california has been selling at premium
prices compared to almost all other domestic markets the combination of high
prices and low costs has resulted in very strong earnings from elk hills

                                       16
page

     by the end of 2000 occidental produced a total of 100 million boe at elk
hills since its acquisition in 1998 and the property still has an estimated 438
million boe of proved reserves
     occidental is currently in the early stages of a threeyear exploration
program that has already achieved positive results the first test well was
successful  yielding 25 million gross proved barrels production from this
discovery has already begun

middle east
oman
     occidental is the operator on block 9 in oman where it is actively
developing six fields occidental holds a 65 percent interest under a
productionsharing agreement and it operates the safah field in the northwest
part of the block and the wadi lathamal barakah fields in the southcentral
part current gross production is 39000 barrels of oil per day with more than
9000 net to occidental
     the safah waterflood is now in its second year the field remains
occidentals most important development project in oman and it expects to
increase ultimate recovery from the safah field from 20 percent to 30 percent of
the oil in place occidentals contract which runs through 2015 can be
extended to 2025 upon completion of the waterflood
     occidental is also the operator and owner of a 100 percent oil interest and
a 65 percent gas interest in block 27 where it began to drill the first
exploration wells in the fourth quarter of 2000

pakistan
     occidental holds interests in the badin blocks in pakistan which are
operated by bp current gross production is 58000 boe per day occidentals net
share is approximately 14000 boe per day
     data obtained from a threedimensional seismic survey on the badin blocks
in 1996 and 1997 has significantly increased the success rate for both
exploration and development while at the same time reducing dry hole costs
     current plans call for drilling 13 to 15 wells per year to develop existing
and newly developed fields by the end of 2002 and it is also continuing to
evaluate additional exploration opportunities

yemen
     in 1998 occidental swapped its holdings in malaysia and the philippines
which had long lead times and intensive capital requirements for shells
production interests in colombia and yemen in yemen the asset swap allowed
occidental to more than double its interest in the masila block which is
operated by nexen to a 38 percent working interest gross production has
increased from 120000 barrels per day early in 1994 when operations began to
217000 barrels per day in 2000 occidentals net share was approximately 27000
barrels per day in 2000
     the current plan is to continue to exploit identified reserves through a
focused drilling program over the next five years occidental believes this
program will maintain gross production at approximately 230000 barrels per day
through 2002
     in adjacent east shabwa production has risen substantially since
occidental acquired its 29 percent interest in 1999 in a swap with unocal
current gross production is averaging 28000 barrels of oil per day from three
fields approximately 6000 barrels of oil per day net to occidental up from
16000 at the time of the swap threedimensional seismic surveys planned for
2001 will help identify additional exploration objectives in east shabwa
occidental is also evaluating exploration acreage

qatar
     in qatar occidentals strategy is to continue development of the offshore
north dome and south dome fields since 1994 it has produced about 190 million
gross barrels of oil in qatar total yearend 2000 proved oil reserves net to
occidental for both fields are estimated to be approximately 153 million
barrels combined production for the two fields in 2000 was approximately
105000 barrels per day gross and approximately 49000 barrels per day net to
occidental
     at the north dome field occidental is implementing a waterflood project to
develop the shuaiba reservoir occidental expects to complete a water injection
plant by the end of the first quarter of 2001 with injection capacity of 160000
barrels of water per day and it plans to drill 15 wells  8 producers and 7
injectors  in 2001
     in 2002 occidental expects to begin further development of nonshuaiba
reserves
     occidental is also evaluating secondgeneration enhancedrecovery projects
at the north dome field
     occidental has completed its evaluation of the south dome field and has
submitted a full field development plan to the government

saudi arabia
     the government of saudi arabia has decided to open its natural gas sector
to foreign investment to help meet the kingdoms needs for fuel electric power
and water occidental was one of the firms invited by saudi authorities to
submit letters of intent to participate in two of the three core natural gas and
infrastructure ventures approved for development occidental jointly with
enron has submitted proposals that include 1 upstream exploration
development and production 2 midstream gathering processing and transmission
and 3 downstream distribution

libya
     occidental is also evaluating a series of opportunities in libya that focus
on returning to operate the assets that it operated before the us government
imposed sanctions in 1986 occidental sees significant potential for enhancing
production from these older fields as well as applying stateoftheart
technology to its existing exploration prospects occidental has a long track
record of success in libya but its return is contingent upon a shift in us
policy permitting us companies to resume operation of their existing libyan
assets

latin america
colombia

     in colombia occidental is pursuing an aggressive drilling program to
optimize the recovery of reserves from cano limon occidental completed 16
development wells in 2000 and expects to complete another 20 wells in 2001 and
11 wells in 2002 production in 2000 was 93000 gross barrels of oil per day
32000 barrels per day net to occidental
     although liftings have been significantly reduced since june 2000 due to
disruptions of the cano limon pipeline occidental presently anticipates that it
will recover the proved reserves attributable to its contract which amount to
less than 3 percent of its worldwide proved oil and gas reserves
     occidental began drilling the gibraltar exploration well in november 2000
the well location is approximately 100 miles west of cano limon and less than
two miles from a major pipeline that is connected to the export market the
pipeline has a capacity of 250000 barrels per day and is currently 40 percent
full occidental expects to complete the well in mid year

ecuador
     gross production from occidentals block 15 interests in ecuador is
currently averaging approximately 30000 barrels of oil per day net to
occidental of 17000 barrels per day
     occidental recently farmed out a 40 percent economic interest in block 15
to alberta energy company ltd aec this transaction reduces occidentals
business and political risk in ecuador and is expected to largely fund its
capital program incountry for the next four years
     both occidental and aec are members of a consortium of producers that have
formed an independent pipeline company to build a new heavy oil pipeline in
ecuador ecuador is currently pipelinecapacity constrained so the new pipeline
is expected to foster oil development the independent pipeline company has
signed an agreement with the government to build a 500kilometer pipeline from
the interior oriente basin to the coast of ecuador over a twoyear period the
pipeline is expected to make it feasible for occidental to develop the
potentially significant eden yuturi field it discovered several years ago in the
southeastern edge of block 15

business review  chemicals
     the performance of the chemical business is difficult to forecast from year
to year but when the market is strong these businesses are capable of
contributing strong earnings and cash flow
     after a strong first half of 2000 in the pvc business sales declined in
the second half as customers began to draw down inventories that had grown with
the expectation of higher prices
     in occidentals chloralkali business the reduced demand for vinyls in the
second half of 2000 has adversely impacted the chlorine market chlorine sales
and operating rates have declined operating rates dropped to 85 percent in the
second half  down from 99 percent in the first half of the year
     feedstock and energy cost increases adversely affected earnings in the
third and fourth quarter
     the upside to the reduced demand for chlorine is supply shortages in the
caustic soda markets where demand has remained stable and prices are increasing
     petrochemical prices are expected to remain under increasing pressure with
the startup of significant new capacity this year and next from basffina
formosa plastics and union carbidenova chemicals margins are expected to
remain compressed under the pressure of sustained high feedstock costs
     the primary goal of occidentals chemicals business is to harvest cash that
can be used to reduce debt and to fund new opportunities as shown below from
1995 through 2000 total cash flow from the chemicals business was 36 billion
 with 25 billion in cash after capital expenditures coming from occidentals
core chemical businesses asset sales net of acquisitions accounted for 11

summary of results and plans for future growth
     in summary the strategic moves made in the past three years have resulted
in significant growth for occidental
     in oil and gas occidentals profitability per barrel has grown
significantly occidental has increased production by a compound annual growth
rate of 6 percent and it has increased its reservestoproduction ratio by 40
percent upgrading its portfolio of assets has enabled occidental to improve
both oil and gas price realizations operating and administrative costs have
been reduced significantly since 1997 these actions contributed to substantial
improvements in recurring earnings from occidentals oil and gas business
     in chemicals occidental has delivered the synergies expected from its
alliances when the chemical cycle turns upward the chemical business will
generate more cash flow
     from its proforma high debt level in april occidental exceeded its 2
billion debt reduction target for 2000 by an additional 800 million it has
also improved its return on equity the growth in occidentals return on equity
over the past three years demonstrates that its strategy for creating value is
sound
     occidental has ongoing growth initiatives within its base assets to achieve
the kind of growth necessary to exceed its financial targets in oil and gas it
will rely on a threepronged strategy that encompasses enhanced oil recovery
exploration and acquisitions in enhanced oil recovery occidental has focused
on two core areas  the middle east and latin america  where it has a long
history of success in exploration occidental has a focused program targeting
opportunities in its core areas in the us the middle east and latin america
     the commodity chemicals industry is currently under the pressure of high
energy prices and soft

demand when the industry begins to recover occidental expects its core
operations to generate strong cash flow
     overall however higher energy prices are a significant net benefit to
occidentals earnings and cash flow

2001 outlook
oil and natural gas
     the petroleum industry is a highly competitive business subject to
significant volatility due to numerous external market forces crude oil and
natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather
inventory levels competing fuel prices overall demand and the availability of
supply
     while fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting crude oil prices over
the long term daytoday prices may be more volatile in the futures markets
such as on the nymex and other exchanges which make it difficult to accurately
predict oil and natural gas prices however weather patterns do have a more
immediate effect particularly on natural gas prices in the united states the
initially severe 20002001 winter season increased demand for natural gas and
tight supply led to very low inventory levels inventories at the end of 2000
were at their lowest levels for that time of year since 1993
     gas production in california of approximately 300 million cubic feet per
day accounts for about 45 percent of occidentals total us gas production the
california border and the henry hub prices are usually close in value in the
late fall of 2000 the price differential between henry hub and the california
border began to increase driving california prices higher than the nymex index
the reasons behind the increased differential are complex but the change is due
partially to supply disruptions caused when a major pipeline transporting gas
from the southwestern states to california was temporarily out of commission
subsequently a myriad of other factors contributed to a further widening in the
differential that exceeded 300 in december and remains volatile on a
daytoday basis
     since there is a time lag of one month between occidentals gas production
and recorded sales the results from high gas prices in december 2000 will have
a significant impact on the companys financial performance in the first quarter
of 2001 the combination of high gas prices and low inventory levels which
continue in the first quarter of 2001 and the unique characteristics of the
california gas market is expected to result in higher average gas price
realizations for occidental in 2001 than in 2000

chemical
     the widely reported slowdown in the us economy reduced operating rates in
petrochemicals and occidentals chloralkalivinyls business to the low 80
percent level these low operating rates are continuing in the first quarter
normally the chemical industry is profitable when operating rates range from
the high 80 to low 90 percent levels under current conditions occidental is
unable to pass through to its customers the full cost of higher electricity and
natural gas prices
     although overall pricing may improve in the chemical segment in the second
half of 2001 from the decline experienced in the second half of 2000 higher
energy and feedstock costs and lower demand would continue to have a negative
effect on chemical margins specific comments by subsegment are given below

chloralkali
     domestic demand for chlorine is expected to grow approximately 2 percent in
2001 but industry capacity additions are expected to limit operating rates
caustic soda markets should remain tight until the vinyls demand for chlorine
strengthens
     chlorine prices peaked early in the third quarter of 2000 due to strong
global demand for ethylene dichloride edc and strong domestic demand for pvc
in the first half of the year later in the third quarter reduced demand for
chlorine resulted in falling prices and reduced operating rates liquid caustic
soda demand remained steady and prices increased due to the reduced supply this
trend of increasing prices for liquid caustic and declining prices for chlorine
is expected to continue in 2001 occidental announced february 21 2001 that it
will temporarily suspend production at its convent louisiana chloralkali and
edc plant effective february 28 2001 the decision was made in response to
sharply higher costs for raw materials particularly ethylene feedstock and
electricity the facility will remain idle until economic conditions improve

vinyls
     for 2001 demand is expected to increase from second half 2000 levels
however overall growth will remain modest tempered by higher energy costs and
lower consumer confidence excess pvc resin is expected to be available and
operating rates constrained as the marketplace begins to absorb new capacity
from the staged startup of the industrys major new pvc plant addition in
louisiana overall vinyls margins are expected to decline

petrochemicals equistar
     industry forecasts project continued pressure on margins due to continued
high feedstock costs combined with weak demand and capacity additions in the
industry

income summary
     occidental reported net income of 16 billion 426 per share in 2000
on net sales of 136 billion compared with net income of 448 million 124
per share in 1999 on net sales of 78 billion earnings before special items
were 13 billion in 2000 and 253 million in 1999

     the higher balance in trade receivables at december 31 2000 compared with
december 31 1999 reflected additional receivables resulting from higher sales
prices and an increase in production during the year the increase in
receivables from joint ventures partnerships and other was due to higher
marktomarket adjustments in the oil and gas trading group which are almost
entirely offset by higher marktomarket adjustments included in accounts
payable the increase in longterm receivables was due to the addition of notes
receivable from the altura partners related to the acquisition of altura the
lower balance in equity investments primarily reflected the sale of the equity
investment in canadianoxy in april 2000 the increase in the net

                                       23

balance in property plant and equipment reflected the impact of capital
spending and the altura and thums acquisitions offset in part by depreciation
depletion and amortization
     the increase in accounts payable was due to higher marktomarket
adjustments in the oil and gas trading group that are almost entirely offset by
marktomarket adjustments in accounts receivable the increase in current
maturities of longterm debt reflects debt maturities due in 2001 the decrease
in longterm debt primarily reflected debt repaid from the proceeds of the
canadianoxy disposition the monetization of the gom assets and free cash flow
as well as the reclassification of debt that matures in 2001 to current
maturities the nonrecourse debt was incurred as a result of the altura
acquisition the original balance of the nonrecourse debt was approximately
24 billion but occidental paid down the debt by approximately 500 million
during the year from alturas free cash flow the longterm balance of the
obligations under the natural gas delivery commitment decreased from december
31 1999 which reflected a portion of the obligation that is due within one
year and is shown as a current liability other deferred credits and liabilities
includes deferred compensation primarily other postemployment benefits related
to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 106
environmental reserves contract advances deferred revenue and other deferred
items the increase in this account was primarily the result of the increase in

percent of sodium chlorate operations in canada and louisiana aftertax
proceeds from the canadianoxy disposition together with tax benefits from the
disposition of the peru producing properties totaled approximately 700 million

capital expenditures
     commitments at december 31 2000 for major capital expenditures during 2001
and thereafter were approximately 73 million total capital expenditures for
2001 are estimated to be approximately 11 billion occidental will fund these
commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations and proceeds from
existing credit facilities as necessary

derivative activities
     occidentals market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices
interest rates and foreign currency therefore occidental periodically uses
commodity futures contracts options and swaps to hedge the impact of oil and
natural gas price fluctuations uses interest rate swaps and futures contracts
to hedge interest rates on debt and uses forward exchange contracts to hedge
the risk associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9810 accounting for contracts
involved in energy trading and risk management activities was adopted in the
first quarter of 1999 oil and gas trading contracts are measured at fair value
on the balance sheet date gains and losses on such contracts are recognized in
periodic income gains and losses on commodity futures contracts that qualify
for hedge accounting essentially those associated with equity production or
purchases are deferred until recognized as an adjustment to sales revenue or
purchase costs when the related transaction being hedged is finalized gains and
losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts that hedge identifiable
future commitments are deferred until recognized when the related item being
hedged is settled all other contracts are recognized in periodic income
     at december 31 2000 occidental was a party to commodity exchange and
overthecounter forward obligations the financial instruments held for
purposes other than trading expire during the period from january 2001 to
december 2003 and relate to the hedging of natural gas and crude oil prices
the fair value of these instruments at december 31 2000 was 511 million
offsetting the value of these instruments are related physical positions with a
528 million loss the principal components of these instruments and related
physical positions are the related natural gas price swap and the natural gas
delivery commitment which is discussed in note 7 of the accompanying financial
statements at december 31 2000 the difference between the carrying value and
the fair value of these obligations was an unrealized loss of approximately 17
million which is currently deferred any gain or loss will be recognized when
the related transactions are finalized the financial instruments held or issued
for trading purposes mostly expire in 2001 with the exception of a longterm
sales contract that expires in 2010 the fair value of these instruments at
december 31 2000 was 31 million offsetting the value of these instruments are
related physical positions with a 12 million loss the approximate 19 million
net gain was reflected in the consolidated statements of operations the
majority of the gain was from the marktomarket adjustment of a longterm sales
contract under eitf issue no 9810 the results of oil and gas trading
activities excluding the longterm sales contract were not significant
     interest rate swaps are entered into as part of occidentals overall
strategy to maintain part of its debt on a floatingrate basis all of
occidentals remaining interest rate swaps converting fixedrate debt to
floatingrate debt matured during november 2000 the swap rate difference
resulted in approximately 1 million of expense in 2000 less than 1 million of
income in 1999 and approximately 2 million of expense in 1998 compared to what
interest expense would have been had the debt remained at fixed rates the
impact of the swaps on the weighted average interest rates for all debt in 2000
1999 and 1998 was not significant occidental will continue its strategy of
maintaining part of its debt on a floatingrate basis
     at december 31 2000 occidental was a party to a series of forward
interest rate locks that are required to be settled on or prior to december 31
2002 these financial instruments relate to debt raised by a third party to
construct a cogeneration plant that will be subject to a longterm operating
lease to an oxychem affiliate as the lease payments will be directly related to
the amount of interest paid on the underlying debt the forward rate locks were
put in place to hedge the future lease payments the lease payments are expected
to commence on or before december 31 2002 the fair value of these financial
instruments at december 31 2000 was an unrealized loss of 29 million
     occidental is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to its variable
rate 21 billion credit facilities at december 31 2000 there were no
outstanding aggregate balances under these credit facilities therefore a
change in interest rates would have had no effect on occidentals results of
operations
     many of occidentals foreign oil and gas operations and foreign chemical
operations are located in countries whose currencies generally depreciate
against the us dollar on a continuing basis generally an effective currency
forward market does not exist for these countries therefore occidental
attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and
liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for
operating purposes additionally all of occidentals oil and gas foreign
entities have the us dollar as the functional currency since the cash flows
are mainly denominated in us dollars the effect of exchange rate transactions
in foreign currencies is included in periodic income foreign currencies that
are in a net liability position are thus protected from the unfavorable effects
of devaluation however in certain foreign chemical subsidiaries and equity
basis joint ventures where the local currency is the functional currency
occidental has exposure on jointventure debt that is denominated in us
dollars for entities that have a net foreign currency asset position
occidental strives to maintain those positions at low levels to mitigate
exposure to currency devaluation

taxes
     deferred tax liabilities were 12 billion at december 31 2000 net of
deferred tax assets of 845 million the current portion of the deferred tax
assets of 117 million is included in prepaid expenses and other the net
deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income
and reversal of taxable temporary differences

lawsuits claims commitments contingencies and related matters
     occidental and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants or
as potentially responsible parties prps in a substantial number of
lawsuits claims and proceedings including governmental proceedings under the
comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla
and corresponding state acts these governmental proceedings seek funding
remediation and in some cases compensation for alleged property damage
punitive damages and civil penalties aggregating substantial amounts
occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to
date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound
companies occidental has accrued reserves at the most likely cost to be
incurred in those proceedings where it is probable that occidental will incur
remediation costs which can be reasonably estimated in december 1998 david
croucher and others filed suit in the federal district court in houston texas
on behalf of persons claiming to have been beneficiaries of the midcon esop the
suit has been certified as a class action the plaintiffs allege that each of
the us trust company of california the esop trustee and the midcon esop
administrative committee breached its fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs by
failing to properly value the securities held by the esop and allege that
occidental actively participated in such conduct the plaintiffs claim that as
a result of this alleged breach the esop participants are entitled to an
additional aggregate distribution of at least 200 million and that occidental
has been unjustly enriched and is liable for failing to make that distribution
in december 2000 the named plaintiffs and defendants reached a proposed
settlement of the action this settlement provides for occidental to pay the
class 25 million and fees and expenses of plaintiffs counsel as awarded by the
court the court has scheduled a hearing on march 15 2001 to consider approving
the settlement occidental has adequate reserves
     during the course of its operations occidental is subject to audit by
taxing authorities for varying periods in various tax jurisdictions
     it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that
occidental and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from the foregoing lawsuits
claims and proceedings audits commitments contingencies and related matters
several of these matters may involve substantial amounts and if these were to
be ultimately resolved unfavorably to the full amount of their maximum potential
exposure an event not currently anticipated it is possible that such event
could have a material adverse effect upon occidentals consolidated financial
position or results of operations however in managements opinion after
taking into account reserves it is unlikely that any of the foregoing matters
will have a material adverse effect upon occidentals consolidated financial
position or results of operations

environmental expenditures
     occidentals operations in the united states are subject to stringent
federal state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or
maintaining the quality of the environment foreign operations also are subject
to environmental protection laws costs associated with environmental compliance
have increased over time and may continue to rise in the future environmental
expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall
business planning process these expenditures are mainly considered an integral
part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market
demand

environmental remediation
     the laws which require or address environmental remediation may apply
retroactively to previous waste disposal practices and in many cases the laws
apply regardless of fault legality of the original activities or ownership or
control of sites occidental is currently participating in environmental
assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal superfund sites comparable
state sites and other remediation sites including occidental facilities and
previously owned sites also occidental and certain of its subsidiaries have
been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings
involving historical practices at various sites including in some instances
having been named as defendants andor as prps under the federal superfund law
these proceedings seek funding andor remediation and in some cases
compensation for alleged personal injury or property damage punitive damages
and civil penalties aggregating substantial amounts
     occidental does not consider the number of superfund and comparable state
sites at which it has been notified that it has been identified as being
involved to be a relevant measure of exposure although the liability of a prp
and in many cases its equivalent under state law may be joint and several
occidental is usually one of many companies cited as a prp at these sites and
has to date been successful in sharing cleanup costs with other financially
sound companies also many of these sites are still under investigation by the
environmental protection agency epa or the equivalent state agencies prior
to actual cleanup the parties involved assess site conditions and
responsibility and determine the appropriate remedy the majority of remediation
costs are incurred after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency
approval to proceed the ultimate future cost of remediation of certain of the
sites for which occidental has been notified that it has been identified as
being involved cannot be reasonably determined at this time

                                       28
page

     as of december 31 2000 occidental had been notified by the epa or
equivalent state agencies or otherwise had become aware that it had been
identified as being involved at 125 superfund or comparable state sites this
number does not include those sites where occidental has been successful in
resolving its involvement the 125 sites include 34 former diamond shamrock
chemical sites as to which maxus energy corporation has retained all liability
of the remaining 91 sites occidental has denied involvement at 9 sites and has
yet to determine involvement in 20 sites with respect to the remaining 62 of
these sites occidental is in various stages of evaluation and the extent of
liability retained by maxus energy corporation is disputed at 2 of these sites
for 54 of these sites where environmental remediation efforts are probable and
the costs can be reasonably estimated occidental has accrued reserves at the
most likely cost to be incurred the 54 sites include 11 sites as to which
present information indicates that it is probable that occidentals aggregate
exposure is insignificant in determining the reserves occidental uses the most
current information available including similar past experiences available
technology regulations in effect the timing of remediation and costsharing
arrangements for the remaining 8 of the 62 sites being evaluated occidental
does not have sufficient information to determine a range of liability but
occidental does have sufficient information on which to base the opinion
expressed above in the lawsuits claims commitments contingencies and related
matters section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations for managements opinion on lawsuits and
proceedings and on other environmental loss contingencies see the above noted

     operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis remediation expenses
relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to
current or future revenue generation occidental did not incur any additional
remediation expenses in 2000 1999 and 1998 capital expenditures relate to
longer lived improvements in facilities although total costs may vary in any
one year over the long term segment operating and capital expenditures for
environmental compliance generally are expected to increase the environmental
reserves as shown in the table above have been provided for environmental
remediation liabilities at the superfund and comparable state sites discussed
above and for resource conservation and recovery act and other sites where
occidental has environmental remediation responsibility the net decrease in
environmental reserves reflects payments for remediation programs and settlement
agreements
     occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly
owned subsidiary glenn springs holdings inc gsh in 1998 gsh was given
full management authority over all remediation sites and reports directly to
occidentals corporate management

foreign investments
     portions of occidentals assets outside north america are exposed to
political and economic risks occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to
mitigate its exposure against such risks at december 31 2000 the carrying
value of occidentals assets in countries outside north america aggregated
approximately 18 billion or approximately 10 percent of occidentals total
assets at that date of such assets approximately 12 billion was located in
the middle east approximately 428 million was located in latin america and
substantially all of the remainder were located in russia and pakistan
